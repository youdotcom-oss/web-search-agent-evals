This agent response includes information on setting up PostgreSQL with the Guacamole docker installation, fulfilling this element, but doesn't explicitly mention what version of PostgreSQL to use. PostgreSQL version compatibility is a key detail in such a guide. The incompleteness is due to the version compatibility information gap.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":false,"mcpToolCalled":false,"deterministicScore":60,"llmScore":35,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false}}}

This enables human-in-the-loop patterns where you need approval, corrections, or additional information.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use interrupts, you need:\n1. A **checkpointer** to persist the graph state (use durable checkpointers in production)\n2. A **thread ID** in your config so the runtime knows which state to resume\n3. Call `interrupt()` where you want to pause (payload must be JSON-serializable)\n\n## Basic Usage Pattern\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n\n# In your node function\ndef approval_node(state):\n    # This pauses execution and returns the value to the caller\n    approved = interrupt(\"Do you approve this action?\")\n    # After resume, execution continues here with the resume value\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n\n# Initial run - hits the interrupt\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"thread-1\"}}\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": \"data\"}, config=config)\n\n# Check what the interrupt is asking for\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])\n\n# Resume with a response using Command\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. When `interrupt()` is called, LangGraph saves the graph state and pauses execution\n2. The interrupt payload is returned to the caller in the result\n3. To resume, invoke the graph again with `Command(resume=<value>)` using the same thread ID\n4. The resume value is passed back to where `interrupt()` was called\n5. Execution continues from that point\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n- **Approval flows**: Review critical steps before execution\n- **Edit state**: Allow users to correct or enhance the graph state\n- **Review tool calls**: Verify LLM outputs before proceeding\n- **Multi-turn conversations**: Enable dynamic, interactive dialogues\n\nThe `interrupt()` function simplifies human-in-the-loop patterns compared to manually implementing interrupts through node configuration.\n\nSources:\n- [Interrupts - Docs by LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts)\n- [Interrupts and Commands in LangGraph: Building Human-in-the-Loop Workflows - DEV Community](https://dev.to/jamesbmour/interrupts-and-commands-in-langgraph-building-human-in-the-loop-workflows-4ngl)\n- [How to wait for user input using interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input/)\n- [LangChain - Changelog | `interrupt`: Simplifying human-in-the-loop](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/interrupt-simplifying-human-in-the-loop-agents)\n- [Human-in-the-Loop with LangGraph: Mastering Interrupts and Commands (1/3) | by Piyush Agnihotri | Jul, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@piyushagni5/human-in-the-loop-with-langgraph-mastering-interrupts-and-commands-9e1cf2183ae3)\n- [Making it easier to build human-in-the-loop agents with interrupt](https://www.blog.langchain.com/making-it-easier-to-build-human-in-the-loop-agents-with-interrupt/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about LangGraph human interrupts and how to use them in Python.","timestamp":32075},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":32075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QzPqcQk5V1syS8t8FwkvJj","status":"completed","timestamp":32075},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here's how to use LangGraph's human interrupt and resume functionality in Python:\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**LangGraph interrupts** allow you to pause graph execution at specific points and wait for external input before continuing.

Use spawn Context Instead of fork\n```python\nmp.get_context('spawn')\n```\nThis avoids fork-related issues with shared memory and thread corruption.\n\n### 2. Use SimpleQueue Instead of Queue\nFor inter-process communication, use `multiprocessing.SimpleQueue` which doesn't spawn additional threads:\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import SimpleQueue\n```\n\n### 3. Set Thread Limits Per Process\n```python\ntorch.set_num_threads(int)\n```\nIf you have N vCPUs and M processes, set each process to use `floor(N/M)` threads.\n\n### 4. Use DistributedDataParallel\nPyTorch recommends using `nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` instead of manual multiprocessing or `nn.DataParallel`.\n\n### 5. Handle Termination with Timeouts\n```python\nprocess.terminate()\nprocess.join(timeout)\nif process.is_alive():\n    process.kill()\n```\n\n### 6.

You can organize your code into as many files as makes sense for readability, with each file focused on a logical grouping of functionality.\n\nThe important distinction is that the **directory name** should match the package name, but individual **file names** within that package should be descriptive of their contents rather than duplicating the package name.\n\nSources:\n- [Package names - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/blog/package-names)\n- [Effective Go - The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)\n- [Style guideline for Go packages · rakyll.org](https://rakyll.org/style-packages/)\n- [Go Style Decisions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/decisions.html)\n- [Name Conventions In Go](https://thefortunedays.com/articles/golang-name-conventions/)\n- [Naming packages - KodeKloud Notes](https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/Advanced-Golang/Modules-Packages-and-Imports/Naming-packages/)\n- [Organizing projects and defining names in Go | by Elton Minetto | Inside PicPay | Medium](https://medium.com/inside-picpay/organizing-projects-and-defining-names-in-go-7f0eab45375d)","timestamp":27331}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Go","lang":"Go","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769459066777,"end":1769459094108,"firstResponse":27331,"sessionCreation":0,"total":27331},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.95,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

The main method is the async `env.AI.run()` which takes a model name as the first parameter and an options object as the second parameter.\n\n**Example Pattern**: You can use LLMs like `llama-3.1-8b-instruct` to answer questions by calling the run method with the model and input parameters.\n\n**AI Gateway Integration**: You can enhance your Workers AI usage by integrating with AI Gateway through environment bindings. This adds an object to your Workers AI request for gateway functionality.\n\n**AI Gateway Binding Methods** include:\n- `patchLog` - Send feedback and update metadata\n- `getLog` - Retrieve detailed log information  \n- `getUrl` - Get gateway URLs for direct API access\n- `run` - Execute universal requests\n\n**Pages Functions**: Since Pages Functions are Workers under the hood, you can configure Workers AI bindings for full-stack applications built with Cloudflare Pages.\n\nThe documentation shows these patterns are current as of 2026 with updated compatibility dates and examples.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Workers Bindings · Cloudflare Workers AI docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/)\n- [AI Gateway Binding Methods · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/worker-binding-methods/)\n- [Workers Binding · Cloudflare AI Search docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/usage/workers-binding/)\n- [Get started - Workers and Wrangler · Cloudflare Workers AI docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/workers-wrangler/)\n- [Workers AI · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/workersai/)\n- [Overview · Cloudflare Workers AI docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/)\n- [Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI · Cloudflare Workers AI docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/build-a-retrieval-augmented-generation-ai/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about Workers AI binding usage pattern examples.","timestamp":30200},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":30200},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01C1WQzKAomjXTEtzkCv7Yne","status":"completed","timestamp":30200},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest 2026 documentation, here's what I found about Workers AI binding usage patterns:\n\n## Configuration\n\nWorkers AI bindings are configured in your `wrangler.toml` file or via the Cloudflare dashboard.

Handle parent-child relationships properly\n\n**Figma Node Decoder** is a useful library that can be integrated into your plugin to convert between Figma nodes and JSON, though it requires proper parent relation references in the JSON structure.\n\nThe Figma community has several open-source examples, particularly the **JSON-to-Figma** repository by Pavel Laptev, which demonstrates how to create a vanilla Figma plugin for this purpose.\n\nSources:\n- [JSONtoNodeGenerator | Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1230431116839804811/jsontonodegenerator)\n- [How to Import JSON into Figma? - The Design System Guide](https://thedesignsystem.guide/knowledge-base/how-to-import-json-into-figma)\n- [GitHub - gavinmcfarland/figma-node-decoder](https://github.com/gavinmcfarland/figma-node-decoder)\n- [How to create SceneNode with Figma API and paste it to design? | Figma Forum](https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/how-to-create-scenenode-with-figma-api-and-paste-it-to-design-32358)\n- [GitHub - PavelLaptev/JSON-to-Figma](https://github.com/PavelLaptev/JSON-to-Figma)\n- [JSON to Figma Plugin Tutorial | Medium](https://pavellaptev.medium.com/json-to-figma-how-to-create-a-vanilla-figma-plugin-8aec40561886)","timestamp":28641}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"Figma_Plugin","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769460349208,"end":1769460377849,"firstResponse":28641,"sessionCreation":0,"total":28641},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":false,"score":0.6,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

The API continues to be maintained in the googleapis repository.\n\nSources:\n- [SSML mark timepointing (v1beta1) suddenly only returns the timepoints until first period](https://discuss.google.dev/t/ssml-mark-timepointing-v1beta1-suddenly-only-returns-the-timepoints-until-first-period/104868)\n- [googleapis/google/cloud/texttospeech/v1beta1/cloud_tts.proto](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/texttospeech/v1beta1/cloud_tts.proto)\n- [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml)\n- [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech v1beta1 API - TimepointType](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/reference/Google.Cloud.TextToSpeech.V1Beta1/latest/Google.Cloud.TextToSpeech.V1Beta1.SynthesizeSpeechRequest.Types.TimepointType)\n- [Cloud TTS release notes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/release-notes)","timestamp":25665}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Google-Cloud-TTS","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769460769682,"end":1769460795347,"firstResponse":25665,"sessionCreation":0,"total":25665},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":false,"score":0.6,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).
