ETL**\n- Modern cloud-native architectures favor ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) where raw data is loaded first, then transformed using the warehouse's processing power\n- Enables parallel processing, flexibility for iterative reprocessing, and better scalability\n\n### 2. **Real-Time Data Integration with CDC**\n- Implement **Change Data Capture (CDC)** for real-time data synchronization\n- Capture and replicate changes as they occur to keep data warehouses current\n\n### 3. **Data Quality Management**\n- Conduct thorough data quality assessments before and during ETL processes\n- Implement validation checks for duplicates, null values, and data consistency\n- Prevent \"data swamps\" through robust governance practices\n\n### 4. **Build for Scale and Performance**\n- Design pipelines to handle growing data volumes without performance degradation\n- Implement dynamic resource allocation to avoid bottlenecks\n- Use parallel processing and automation (partitioning, incremental loading)\n\n### 5. **Monitoring and Early Warning Systems**\n- Implement proactive monitoring to detect issues before they escalate\n- Set up continuous testing and monitoring pipelines\n- Maintain version control for managing changes effectively\n\n### 6. **Automation and Modern Tooling**\n- Automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual errors\n- Leverage tools like Apache Airflow, dbt, and cloud-based ETL solutions\n- Use AI-native tools for enhanced data connectivity and analytics\n\n### 7. **Security and Compliance**\n- Implement data masking, especially in cloud environments\n- Protect sensitive data throughout the ETL process\n- Build scalable compliance frameworks\n\n### 8. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**\n- Maintain thorough documentation of pipeline
