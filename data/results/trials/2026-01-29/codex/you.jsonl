The project is hosted as `kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch` and is explicitly framed as a **rootless replacement** for older VoLTE patches. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **How it works (high level)**: It uses **Shizuku** to call Android’s internal **CarrierConfigLoader.overrideConfig()** API, which is normally restricted to privileged system apps. This is how it bypasses carrier checks without root. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Device/OS scope**: The README’s official scope is **Tensor-based Pixel devices** (Pixel 6 and newer) on **Android 11+**, and it documents a set of supported carriers (with strong emphasis on LG U+ in Korea). In other regions, functionality may be community‑confirmed but not guaranteed. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Update fragility is a real risk**: Google’s **October 2025 Pixel update** blocked the loophole the app used (classed as CVE‑2025‑48617), which **broke Pixel IMS** until a workaround emerged. The same kind of break can happen again with future updates. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **You often must re‑apply after system updates**: The project FAQ explicitly says the patch **needs to be re‑run after OS updates**. That means every monthly/quarterly patch cycle is a potential disruption. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Community status in late 2025–Jan 2026**: Users report that a GitHub build of the IMS app (package `io.github.vvb2060.ims`) worked again after updates, but there are also reports of breakages and resets. Treat Reddit reports as **anecdotal**. ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com//r/GooglePixel/comments/1pckplt/did_google_kill_shizuku_again/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Alternatives / forks exist**: “TurboIMS” is a fork that advertises similar IMS feature toggles and Shizuku use. It’s not official Pixel software and is maintained separately. ([github.com](https://github.com/Turbo1123/TurboIMS?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**What that means for 2026 decisions**\n\n- **Expect churn**: Because it relies on an internal API, **future Android/Pixel patches can break it with no notice**. Don’t rely on it for critical calling in places where VoLTE is mandatory. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Carrier reality still rules**: Even if you can toggle IMS settings, **carriers can still block/deny IMS registration** at the network level. That’s why results are inconsistent and device/carrier‑specific.

The project is hosted as `kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch` and is explicitly framed as a **rootless replacement** for older VoLTE patches. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **How it works (high level)**: It uses **Shizuku** to call Android’s internal **CarrierConfigLoader.overrideConfig()** API, which is normally restricted to privileged system apps. This is how it bypasses carrier checks without root. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Device/OS scope**: The README’s official scope is **Tensor-based Pixel devices** (Pixel 6 and newer) on **Android 11+**, and it documents a set of supported carriers (with strong emphasis on LG U+ in Korea). In other regions, functionality may be community‑confirmed but not guaranteed. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Update fragility is a real risk**: Google’s **October 2025 Pixel update** blocked the loophole the app used (classed as CVE‑2025‑48617), which **broke Pixel IMS** until a workaround emerged. The same kind of break can happen again with future updates. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **You often must re‑apply after system updates**: The project FAQ explicitly says the patch **needs to be re‑run after OS updates**. That means every monthly/quarterly patch cycle is a potential disruption. ([github.com](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Community status in late 2025–Jan 2026**: Users report that a GitHub build of the IMS app (package `io.github.vvb2060.ims`) worked again after updates, but there are also reports of breakages and resets. Treat Reddit reports as **anecdotal**. ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com//r/GooglePixel/comments/1pckplt/did_google_kill_shizuku_again/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Alternatives / forks exist**: “TurboIMS” is a fork that advertises similar IMS feature toggles and Shizuku use. It’s not official Pixel software and is maintained separately. ([github.com](https://github.com/Turbo1123/TurboIMS?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**What that means for 2026 decisions**\n\n- **Expect churn**: Because it relies on an internal API, **future Android/Pixel patches can break it with no notice**. Don’t rely on it for critical calling in places where VoLTE is mandatory. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Carrier reality still rules**: Even if you can toggle IMS settings, **carriers can still block/deny IMS registration** at the network level. That’s why results are inconsistent and device/carrier‑specific. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **If you need stability**: The safest 2026 option is still **official carrier support** for your exact Pixel model/region.

Return only JSON as per schema.”\n\nWhy it helps:\n- Enforces exact output fields.\n- Makes post‑processing and validation trivial.\n\n### 2) Explicitly define the coordinate format and scale (repeat it)\nEven though the API defines `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` normalized to **0–1000**, repeat it in the prompt to reduce confusion and improve determinism in medical contexts. citeturn2search0\n\n**Add to system prompt**\n- “Use **`[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]`** in **0–1000 normalized** coordinates.”\n\n### 3) Constrain object count and target class scope\nMedical images often contain **incidental anatomy** that can distract the model. Constrain it:\n\n- “Detect only **pulmonary nodules**; ignore ribs, heart silhouette, devices, and text overlays.”\n- “Limit to **max 10** boxes.”\n\nThis mirrors the technique in the official example (limit count, no masks). citeturn2search0\n\n### 4) Use strict inclusion/exclusion criteria in the prompt\nMedical imaging benefits from **narrow, clinically‑defined targets**:\n\n- “Include only **solid nodules ≥ 5 mm**; exclude calcified granulomas.”\n- “If uncertain, **omit** the box instead of guessing.”\n\nThis reduces false positives and keeps outputs clinically conservative.\n\n### 5) Provide anatomical localization constraints\nHelp the model focus:\n\n- “Only within lung fields.”\n- “Only within the femoral head region.”\n- “Ignore external devices, labels, and borders.”\n\nThis is especially effective in radiographs and ultrasound where text overlays are common.\n\n### 6) Make the model label instances by position\nUse standardized labels that are easy to parse downstream:\n\n- “Label each box as `nodule_1_top_left`, `nodule_2_bottom_right`.”\n\nThe Vertex AI sample recommends unique labels for multiple instances. citeturn2search0\n\n### 7) Multi‑step prompting for hard cases\nFor low‑contrast or noisy modalities (ultrasound, low‑dose CT):\n\n**Two‑step approach**\n1) Ask for presence/absence and rough count.  \n2) Then request bounding boxes for the confirmed targets.\n\nThis reduces over‑detection and improves stability.\n\n### 8) Include image modality and windowing hints\nMedical models benefit from context:\n\n- “This is a **CT lung window** slice.”\n- “This is a **PA chest X‑ray**.”\n\nEven if you aren’t changing pixels, the semantic hint can improve localization.\n\n---\n\n## Prompt template (Vertex AI GenAI bounding boxes)\n\n```text\nSystem:\nReturn bounding boxes as an array of objects with fields:\n- box_2d: [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] with coordinates normalized 0–1000\n- label: string\nNever return masks.

([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.html?utm_source=openai))\n   - Use labels or bot scores in custom rules for granular actions (block, challenge, slow, or degrade). ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-bot-control.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) **Rate limiting tied to identity, not IP**\n   - Rate‑limit by session/user/device/token; AWS WAF supports rate‑based rules over session tokens and can combine with bot‑confidence headers. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/how-to-use-aws-waf-bot-control-for-targeted-bots-signals-and-mitigate-evasive-bots-with-adaptive-user-experience/?utm_source=openai))\n   - Apply tighter limits on high‑risk workflows (login, coupon redemption, add‑to‑cart, checkout).\n\n3) **Adaptive challenges and silent verification**\n   - Prefer invisible or low‑friction challenges over CAPTCHAs. Cloudflare notes methods to challenge bots without user friction. ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/bot-management/?utm_source=openai))\n   - If using enterprise anti‑bot, use device‑level IDs and cryptographic verification for verified bots/agents where possible. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-bot-control.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n4) **Risk‑scored transactions**\n   - For payments and refunds, use risk scoring and fraud signals to gate approvals. Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise/Fraud Prevention supports transaction‑level risk scoring and carding indicators. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/recaptcha/docs/fraud-prevention?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) **Response shaping (“degrade” instead of hard block)**\n   - Reduce data returned (smaller pages, partial results) for medium‑confidence bots to blunt scraping without hurting humans. AWS WAF shows this pattern using bot confidence + rate signals.

If you have UI that must capture those edge swipes, **only** use `setSystemGestureExclusionRects()` for the minimal necessary regions.\n- Compose guidance mirrors Views:\n  - Use `safeDrawing`, `safeGestures`, and `safeContent` insets, with `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(...)` or helpers like `safeDrawingPadding()` to keep content visible and avoid gesture conflicts.\n- For immersive content (games/media), use immersive mode sparingly and only disable gestures while actively interacting, so users can always exit.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether you’re using Views or Compose and I can give a minimal, up‑to‑date code snippet specifically for gesture nav + edge‑to‑edge.","timestamp":50399}],"duration":50399,"pass":true,"score":0.78,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=0).
