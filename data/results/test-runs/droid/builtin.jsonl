Memory Types in LangGraph**\n- **Short-term Memory**: Maintains context during single interactions/sessions\n- **Long-term Memory**: Persists information across multiple conversations for continuity\n- **Semantic/Episodic/Procedural Memory**: Different memory types for various use cases\n\n**2. Context Engineering Framework**\nLangGraph categorizes context along two dimensions:\n- **Mutability**: Static (immutable data like user metadata) vs Dynamic (conversation history, intermediate results)\n- **Lifetime**: Runtime context (single execution) vs Cross-conversation context (persistent across sessions)\n\n**3. RAG Integration Patterns**\nRecent articles highlight the \"Production Trinity\" approach combining:\n- **LangGraph** for multi-agent workflow orchestration\n- **RAG** for enhanced knowledge retrieval and context injection\n- **UCP (Unified Control Protocol)** for transactional capabilities\n\nEnterprise applications report a **45% improvement in performance** using this integrated approach.\n\n**4. Key Implementation Components**\n- **Conversation Node**: Manages interaction logic by merging messages with agent state\n- **Retrieval Tool Node**: Uses vector search (e.g., MongoDB) to fetch relevant information\n- **Summarize Context Node**: Condenses retrieved passages for clarity\n- **Summarize Conversation Node**: Trims earlier messages while preserving context\n- **End Node**: Updates memory and context with each interaction\n\n**5.
