It distinguishes between\n short-term (conversation history within a session, preserved by checkpointers) and long-term memory (user/application-level data across sessions, managed by \"stores\"). Enhanced persistence backends like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB are\n expected in 2026. The LangMem library further augments memory management.\n*   **RAG Context Injection:** LangGraph is well-suited for RAG, facilitating dynamic context injection. A typical RAG pipeline involves document processing\n, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval, and prompt construction. Developers have fine-grained control over context injection within nodes, leveraging long-term memory for various retrieval methods.\n*   **LangGraph in 2026:**\n Anticipated developments include LangGraph 2.0 (Q2 2026) with improved API stability and type safety, performance optimizations, multi-agent protocol support (A2A, MCP), enhanced observability with LangSmith,\n expanded guardrail nodes, and cloud-native persistence.
