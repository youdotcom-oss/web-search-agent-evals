{"id":"websearch-1611","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\"\nHow to store data locally using AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54 according to 2026 documentation?","output":"Based on the 2026 documentation for Expo SDK 54, here's how to store data locally using AsyncStorage:\n\n## Installing AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54\n\nThe recommended way to install AsyncStorage is using the Expo CLI:\n\n```bash\nexpo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\nThis ensures you get the correct version compatible with SDK 54.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Storing Data\n\n```javascript\nimport AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';\n\n// Store simple string data\nconst storeData = async (key, value) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Retrieving Data\n\n```javascript\n// Retrieve data\nconst getData = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);\n    if (value !== null) {\n      return value;\n    }\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Working with JSON Objects\n\nSince AsyncStorage only stores strings, you need to stringify/parse JSON objects:\n\n```javascript\n// Store JSON object\nconst storeObject = async (key, object) => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = JSON.stringify(object);\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, jsonValue);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n\n// Retrieve JSON object\nconst getObject = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);\n    return jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : null;\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Removing Data\n\n```javascript\n// Remove a single item\nconst removeItem = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.removeItem(key);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n\n// Clear all data\nconst clearAll = async () => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.clear();\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Merging Data\n\nAsyncStorage supports merging data efficiently:\n\n```javascript\nconst mergeData = async (key, object) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.mergeItem(key, JSON.stringify(object));\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Alternative: expo-sqlite with localStorage API\n\nAccording to the Expo SDK 54 changelog, there's now an alternative option. **expo-sqlite now includes a drop-in implementation for the localStorage web API**, which can be used for local storage if you want web compatibility:\n\n```javascript\n// This provides localStorage API for cross-platform compatibility\nimport { localStorage } from 'expo-sqlite';\n\n// Use it like web localStorage\nlocalStorage.setItem('key', 'value');\nconst value = localStorage.getItem('key');\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep it small** - AsyncStorage is designed for small amounts of data\n2. **Security** - AsyncStorage is NOT encrypted by default. Encrypt sensitive data yourself\n3. **Error handling** - Always use try/catch blocks to handle errors gracefully\n4. **Performance** - For large datasets, consider using expo-sqlite or other database solutions instead\n\n## Important Notes for SDK 54\n\n- AsyncStorage continues to work as before in SDK 54\n- It's compatible with both Legacy and New Architecture\n- Works on iOS, Android, and web platforms\n- Asynchronous operations prevent blocking the main thread\n\nSources:\n- [Expo SDK 54 Changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog/sdk-54)\n- [Mastering Async Storage in React Native with Expo - Toxigon](https://toxigon.com/react-native-expo-how-to-use-async-storage)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest information about using AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54.","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":40555},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014VTmMQgQ2vMDanAw8Tk6rL","status":"completed","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get the official Expo SDK 54 documentation and search for more specific AsyncStorage information.","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":40555},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01D72nt5m7uLS1ZqCn97BS2H","status":"completed","timestamp":40555},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01DTqPVShAtPdZiaSWhbTZ8t","status":"completed","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific documentation about AsyncStorage installation and usage in Expo.","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":40555},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LXH3bXd96n5M6L3UqK6wmY","status":"completed","timestamp":40555},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015oYQdW1FDD8ntDWGJemWoV","status":"completed","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed content from the Reddit discussion and the comprehensive guides.","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":40555},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LPNKqgoeymjVmZGa9V6BLt","status":"completed","timestamp":40555},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the 2026 documentation for Expo SDK 54, here's how to store data locally using AsyncStorage:\n\n## Installing AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54\n\nThe recommended way to install AsyncStorage is using the Expo CLI:\n\n```bash\nexpo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\nThis ensures you get the correct version compatible with SDK 54.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Storing Data\n\n```javascript\nimport AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';\n\n// Store simple string data\nconst storeData = async (key, value) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Retrieving Data\n\n```javascript\n// Retrieve data\nconst getData = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);\n    if (value !== null) {\n      return value;\n    }\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Working with JSON Objects\n\nSince AsyncStorage only stores strings, you need to stringify/parse JSON objects:\n\n```javascript\n// Store JSON object\nconst storeObject = async (key, object) => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = JSON.stringify(object);\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, jsonValue);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n\n// Retrieve JSON object\nconst getObject = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);\n    return jsonValue != null ?
