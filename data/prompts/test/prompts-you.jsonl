It should also mention compatibility with current (2026-ish) versions of Vite/Vue 3/Element Plus or warn about checking version compatibility and plugin maintenance status."}

It should briefly compare tradeoffs (model size/throughput vs. embedding quality) or use-cases (RAG/retrieval vs. general semantic search) rather than just listing model names."}

It should not invent options unrelated to Deepgram’s live transcription/VAD configuration or to Pipecat’s DeepgramSTTService interface."}
