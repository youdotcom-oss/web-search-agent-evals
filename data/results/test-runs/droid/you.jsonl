Let me provide a complete answer:\n\n## Setting Up Web Push Notifications for Safari iOS 16.4+ (Add to Home Screen Push API)\n\n### Overview\n\nStarting with **iOS and iPadOS 16.4**, Apple introduced support for Web Push notifications for web apps added to the Home Screen. This uses the **W3C standards-based Web Push** system with Push API, Notifications API, and Service Workers.\n\n---\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n1. **Device Requirements:**\n   - iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or later\n   - Supported browsers: Safari, Chrome, and Edge\n\n2. **Web App Requirements:**\n   - The website must be installed on the user's Home Screen as a Progressive Web App (PWA)\n   - Must have a **Web App Manifest** with `display: standalone` or `display: fullscreen`\n   - Push permission must be requested in response to **direct user interaction** (e.g., button tap)\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Create a Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Web App\",\n  \"short_name\": \"MyApp\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLink it in your HTML `<head>`:\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n#### 2. Register a Service Worker\n\nCreate `service-worker.js`:\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  const data = event.data ? event.data.json() : {};\n  const title = data.title || 'Notification';\n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || '',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: data.badge || '/icons/badge.png',\n    data: data.url || '/'\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(title, options)\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow(event.notification.data)\n  );\n});\n```\n\nRegister it in your main JavaScript:\n```javascript\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Request Push Permission (User Interaction Required)\n\n**Important:** On iOS Safari, permission MUST be requested in response to a direct user action (button click):\n\n```javascript\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  try {\n    // Check if push is supported\n    if (!('PushManager' in window)) {\n      console.log('Push notifications not supported');\n      return;\n    }\n\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    \n    // Request notification permission\n    const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n    \n    if (permission !== 'granted') {\n      console.log('Permission denied');\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Subscribe to push notifications\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array('YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY')\n    });\n\n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n    \n    console.log('Push subscription successful:', subscription);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Push subscription failed:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Helper function for VAPID key conversion\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\n// Attach to a button click\ndocument.getElementById('subscribe-btn').addEventListener('click', subscribeToPush);\n```\n\n#### 4. Server-Side: Generate VAPID Keys and Send Notifications\n\nUsing Node.js with the `web-push` library:\n\n```javascript\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\n// Generate VAPID keys (do this once and save them)\n// const vapidKeys = webpush.generateVAPIDKeys();\n\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY',\n  'YOUR_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY'\n);\n\n// Send notification\nasync function sendPushNotification(subscription, payload) {\n  try {\n    await webpush.sendNotification(subscription, JSON.stringify(payload));\n    console.log('Notification sent successfully');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error sending notification:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst payload = {\n  title: 'Hello!',\n  body: 'This is a push notification',\n  icon: '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n  url: '/landing-page'\n};\n\nsendPushNotification(userSubscription, payload);\n```\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes for iOS\n\n| Feature | iOS Behavior |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Home Screen Required** | Users MUST add your web app to their Home Screen first |\n| **User Gesture** | Permission can only be requested after a user interaction |\n| **No APNs Certificate** | You do NOT need an Apple Developer Program membership or APNs certificate |\n| **Push Domain** | Allow URLs from `*.push.apple.com` on your server |\n| **Badge Support** | Badging API is supported via `setAppBadge` and `clearAppBadge` |\n| **Focus Integration** | Notifications integrate with iOS Focus modes |\n| **Rich Media** | Rich media (images, GIFs, videos) in notifications is NOT supported |\n\n---\n\n### User Flow\n\n1.

This is an exceptional result that perfectly anticipates the hypothetical 2026 timeframe by identifying the 'Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite' model as requested in the Target. It provides a comprehensive set of Python examples using the 'google-genai' SDK, covering basic usage, grounding, and the new thinking budget feature. The formatting is excellent, with clear headings and code blocks. It loses two points only because of a minor technical inconsistency (the import statement 'google.generativeai' is for the legacy SDK, while the code and installation use the new 'google-genai' SDK) and the inclusion of some internal 'fetching more details' text at the beginning.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":true,"mcpToolCalled":true,"deterministicScore":50,"llmScore":48,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false,"graderLatency":18246.740716,"llmLatency":18246.68909099998}}}
