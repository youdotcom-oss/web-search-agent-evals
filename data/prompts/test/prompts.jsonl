{"id":"websearch-120","input":"What's the crypto fear and greed index today in November 2025?","metadata":{"category":"General_Knowledge","subcategory":"Cryptocurrency","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false},"hint":"A good answer must explain that the crypto Fear & Greed Index is a real-time sentiment score from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed) and that its exact value for “today in November 2025” cannot be reliably provided now, so the user should check a live source (e.g., Alternative.me or similar trackers) for the current reading. It should clearly distinguish between the general definition/scale of the index and the need to consult up-to-date data for the specific day requested."}
{"id":"websearch-1940","input":"What is the latest 2026 research on GSE201705 regarding single cell lung injury from radiation and immunotherapy?","metadata":{"category":"Research","subcategory":"Bioinformatics","lang":"R","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true},"hint":"A good answer must correctly identify GSE201705 as the GEO dataset for a single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq study of pattern formation in the early spider embryo (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), published in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology (2022). The dataset is NOT related to lung injury or radiation/immunotherapy. A correct response should note this mismatch and clarify that GSE201705 concerns spider embryo development and Hedgehog signaling, not pulmonary research. The lung injury \"cellular atlas of senescent lineages\" study uses PRJNA846488/GSE135893 instead."}
{"id":"websearch-171","input":"Why should I use Redux Toolkit in 2026 according to the official guide?","metadata":{"category":"Documentation","subcategory":"Redux","lang":"React","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true},"hint":"A correct answer should note that Redux Toolkit is the *official, recommended and standard way* to write Redux code (replacing hand-written/legacy core usage) and explain that, per the official guide, you should use it because it is an opinionated, “batteries‑included” toolset that simplifies setup and common Redux patterns (e.g., via `configureStore`, `createSlice`, Immer‑powered immutable updates, and RTK Query), reducing boilerplate, encoding best practices, improving TypeScript support, and preventing common mistakes.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]"}
