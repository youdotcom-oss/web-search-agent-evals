Every node in your graph reads from and writes to a shared state object:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Annotated\nfrom operator import add\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list, add]  # Reducer automatically merges messages\n    context: str\n    \ngraph = StateGraph(State)\n```\n\n### 2. **Checkpointers for Persistence**\n\nLangGraph uses **checkpointers** to persist state across sessions. The main options for 2026:\n\n| Checkpointer | Use Case |\n|--------------|----------|\n| `MemorySaver` / `InMemorySaver` | Development, testing |\n| `SqliteSaver` | Local file-based persistence |\n| `RedisSaver` / `AsyncRedisSaver` | Production-grade, cross-thread memory |\n| `MongoDBSaver` | Long-term memory with semantic search |\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\n\ncheckpointer = SqliteSaver(\"agent.db\")\ngraph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Each conversation uses a thread_id\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"user-123\"}}\n```\n\n### 3. **Cross-Thread Memory (Long-Term)**\n\nFor memories that span multiple conversations, use **LangMem** with a Store:\n\n```python\nfrom langmem import create_manage_memory_tool\n\n# Memories persist across different thread_ids\nmemories = store.search(\n    (\"memories\",),  # Namespace\n    query=state[\"messages\"][-1].content,  # Semantic search\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## RAG Context Injection (2026 Patterns)\n\n### 1. **Dynamic Prompt Injection**\n\nInject retrieved context directly into the system prompt:\n\n```python\ndef prompt(state, store):\n    \"\"\"Dynamic prompt that injects relevant memories\"\"\"\n    # Semantic search for relevant context\n    memories = store.search(\n        (\"memories\",),\n        query=state[\"messages\"][-1].content,\n    )\n    \n    system_msg = f\"\"\"You are an assistant with access to:\n    {memories}\n    \n    Use this context to answer questions.\"\"\"\n    return system_msg\n```\n\n### 2. **Agentic RAG with State Machines**\n\nThe 2026 standard is **Agentic RAG** — a cyclic graph where the agent can:\n- Retrieve documents\n- Grade relevance\n- Re-query if needed\n- Generate final answer\n\n```python\ngraph = StateGraph()\ngraph.add_node(\"retrieve\", retrieve_docs)\ngraph.add_node(\"grade\", grade_relevance)\ngraph.add_node(\"generate\", generate_answer)\n\n# Cyclic flow: can loop back if documents aren't relevant\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"grade\", decide_next, {\n    \"relevant\": \"generate\",\n    \"not_relevant\": \"retrieve\"  # Re-query with refined search\n})\n```\n\n### 3. **Human-in-the-Loop for High-Stakes RAG**\n\n```python\ngraph.compile(\n    checkpointer=checkpointer,\n    interrupt_before=[\"generate\"]  # Pause for human approval\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key 2026 Best Practices\n\n1. **Use custom reducers** for complex state merging (e.g., summarizing old context to prevent overflow)\n2. **Namespace your memories** by type, user, or domain\n3. **Semantic search** with vector embeddings for retrieval (VoyageAI, OpenAI, or local models)\n4. **Redis or MongoDB** for production checkpointing with cross-thread memory\n5. **Interrupt points** for human oversight in critical workflows\n\nThe shift from LangChain's linear DAGs to LangGraph's cyclic state machines is now the baseline for production AI applications in 2026.","hint":"A good answer should explain how LangGraph manages conversational/application state via a TypedDict state schema, node functions that return partial state updates, and checkpoint-based persistence (e.g., MemorySaver, SqliteSaver, or external stores) for short- and long‑term memory, and it must describe how to wire RAG into that state by retrieving documents and injecting them into the graph state (e.g., adding a `documents`/`context` field that is populated by a retriever node and consumed by LLM nodes for prompt construction).[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","timestamp":102670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":102670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FV1zQEWmAg8c7NzGVHb2oJ","status":"completed","timestamp":102670},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search results, here's a comprehensive answer on handling **memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Memory State Management in LangGraph (2026)\n\n### 1. **Core Concept: State as Shared Memory**\n\nLangGraph treats state as the central memory of your system.

Here's the latest Python example using the official `google-genai` SDK:\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install -q -U google-genai\n```\n\n### Python Code Example\n\n```python\nfrom google import genai\n\n# Option 1: Set API key as environment variable (recommended)\n# export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key'\nclient = genai.Client()\n\n# Option 2: Pass API key directly\n# client = genai.Client(api_key='YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY')\n\n# Using Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (current Flash Lite model as of Feb 2026)\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    contents=\"Explain how AI works in a few words\"\n)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n### Key Information for 2026:\n\n1. **Current Flash Lite Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (released June 17, 2025) - optimized for speed and cost-efficiency\n\n2. **SDK**: Use `google-genai` package (replaces the older `google-generativeai` package)\n\n3. **Free Tier Limits** (as of Jan 2026):\n   - 15 RPM (requests per minute) for Flash-Lite\n   - Up to 1,000 requests per day\n   - 1 million token context window\n\n4. **Pricing**: Starting at $0.10 per million input tokens (most affordable Gemini model)\n\n5. **Note**: Gemini 2.5 models are scheduled for retirement on **March 3, 2026**. For production applications, consider monitoring for a Gemini 3 Flash-Lite release or migrate to `gemini-3-flash-preview` for newer capabilities.","timestamp":106729}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Google_Gemini","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-435","exitCode":137,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770376009730,"end":1770376116459,"firstResponse":106729,"sessionCreation":0,"total":106729},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Google only indexes videos on dedicated \"watch pages\" where the video is the **primary content**, not supplementary content\n2. **Your blog post is not considered a video watch page** - If the video accompanies text content, Google sees it as supplementary, not the main focus\n\n### Solutions to Fix Video Indexing Issues\n\n#### 1. **Create Dedicated Watch Pages**\n- Create a separate page where the video is the **main content**\n- The page's primary purpose should be to show users a single video\n- Keep the embedded video on your blog post as well (for user experience), but have a dedicated watch page for indexing\n\n#### 2. **Add VideoObject Schema Markup**\nThis is highly recommended for any embedded video:\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Description of video\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-15\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. **Ensure Thumbnail URL is Provided**\n- Include a valid thumbnail URL in your structured data\n- The \"No thumbnail URL provided\" error is common and easy to fix with proper schema markup\n\n#### 4. **Fix \"Video Outside the Viewport\" Issues**\n- Make sure the video is visible in the initial viewport (above the fold) or at least loads properly\n- Don't hide videos behind accordions, tabs, or JavaScript that delays loading\n\n#### 5. **Check Page Canonicalization**\n- Ensure your page is set as the canonical version\n- Google only indexes videos from canonical pages\n\n### Important Reality Check\n\n**Here's the truth**: Google's guidelines state that blog posts with embedded YouTube videos are generally NOT considered \"watch pages.\" The video is already indexed on YouTube itself, so Google considers it redundant to index it again from your blog.\n\n**Recommended approach:**\n- Focus on getting your **blog post page** indexed (which it likely already is)\n- The YouTube video is already indexed on YouTube's platform\n- Instead of trying to \"double index\" the video, focus on creating quality content\n- Use VideoObject schema markup primarily for **self-hosted videos** or videos where your page is the primary source\n\n### When Video Indexing Makes Sense\n- You host the video yourself (not on YouTube)\n- You have a dedicated video gallery or watch page\n- The video is the main content of the page, not supplementary\n\nIf you absolutely need the embedded YouTube video to appear in video search results tied to your domain, create a dedicated watch page with minimal text where the video is clearly the primary content.","hint":"A good answer must explain common reasons embedded YouTube videos aren’t indexed on blog posts (e.g., not considered a “video watch page,” video outside viewport/not prominent, JavaScript/lazy-load or faulty embed preventing detection) and outline concrete 2024-specific fixes aligned with Google’s video indexing guidelines, such as making the page a proper watch page, ensuring a standard iframe/embed visible on initial load on all devices, adding VideoObject structured data and/or video sitemaps, and using Search Console’s Video Indexing and URL Inspection reports to diagnose and verify indexing.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","timestamp":180569},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":180569},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019YjizTVuBngmDD9ctVEXkx","status":"completed","timestamp":180569},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive answer on how to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on your blog posts in Google Search Console.\n\n## How to Fix Embedded YouTube Videos Not Indexing on Blog Posts (2024)\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nGoogle typically doesn't index embedded YouTube videos on blog posts because:\n\n1. **\"Video isn't on a watch page\" error** -

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026\nBased on my research, here's how to handle Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` in 2026:\n\n## Handling Clerk Organization Webhook Events\n\n### 1. Set Up Webhook Endpoint in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to the [Webhooks page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/webhooks) in the Clerk Dashboard\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your webhook URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`)\n4. Subscribe to organization events:\n   - `organization.created`\n   - `organization.updated`\n   - `organization.deleted`\n5. Copy the **Signing Secret** (starts with `whsec_`)\n\n### 2. Store the Signing Secret\n\nAdd to your `.env` file:\n```env\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here\n```\n\n### 3. Create the Webhook Handler (Next.js App Router Example)\n\n```typescript\n// app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/backend/webhooks'\nimport { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    // Verify the webhook signature using Clerk's helper\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n\n    // Handle organization events\n    switch (evt.type) {\n      case 'organization.created': {\n        const { id, name, slug, created_at, public_metadata, private_metadata } = evt.data\n        // Insert new organization into your database\n        await db.organization.create({\n          data: {\n            clerkOrgId: id,\n            name,\n            slug,\n            createdAt: new Date(created_at),\n            metadata: public_metadata,\n          },\n        })\n        console.log(`Organization created: ${name} (${id})`)\n        break\n      }\n\n      case 'organization.updated': {\n        const { id, name, slug, public_metadata } = evt.data\n        // Update organization in your database\n        await db.organization.update({\n          where: { clerkOrgId: id },\n          data: {\n            name,\n            slug,\n            metadata: public_metadata,\n          },\n        })\n        console.log(`Organization updated: ${name} (${id})`)\n        break\n      }\n\n      case 'organization.deleted': {\n        const { id } = evt.data\n        if (id) {\n          // Delete or soft-delete organization from your database\n          await db.organization.delete({\n            where: { clerkOrgId: id },\n          }).catch(() => {}) // Ignore if already deleted\n          console.log(`Organization deleted: ${id}`)\n        }\n        break\n      }\n    }\n\n    return new Response('Webhook processed', { status: 200 })\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Webhook verification failed:', err)\n    return new Response('Invalid webhook', { status: 400 })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Express.js Example\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/backend/webhooks'\nimport express from 'express'\n\nconst app = express()\n\n// IMPORTANT: Use raw body parser ONLY for webhook route\napp.post(\n  '/api/webhooks/clerk',\n  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }),\n  async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n      const evt = verifyWebhook(req)\n\n      switch (evt.type) {\n        case 'organization.created':\n          await db.organizations.create({ clerkOrgId: evt.data.id, ...evt.data })\n          break\n        case 'organization.updated':\n          await db.organizations.update({ where: { clerkOrgId: evt.data.id }, data: evt.data })\n          break\n        case 'organization.deleted':\n          await db.organizations.delete({ where: { clerkOrgId: evt.data.id } })\n          break\n      }\n\n      res.json({ success: true })\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Webhook error:', err)\n      res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' })\n    }\n  }\n)\n\n// Apply JSON parsing to other routes AFTER webhook\napp.use(express.json())\n```\n\n### 5. Key Best Practices\n\n| Practice | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Use `verifyWebhook()`** | Clerk's built-in helper automatically verifies signatures using `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` |\n| **Idempotency** | Use upserts to handle duplicate webhook deliveries (Svix uses at-least-once delivery) |\n| **Return 200 quickly** | Respond within 15 seconds to avoid timeout retries |\n| **Raw body access** | Don't parse JSON before verification (signature is computed on raw body) |\n| **Index `clerkOrgId`** | Add database indexes for fast lookups |\n| **Handle deletions gracefully** | Use `.catch(() => {})` for delete operations in case already deleted |\n\n### 6. Organization Webhook Payload Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"org_2NNEqL2nrIRdJ194ndJqAHwEfxC\",\n    \"name\": \"My Organization\",\n    \"slug\": \"my-organization\",\n    \"created_at\": 1654012591514,\n    \"updated_at\": 1654012591835,\n    \"public_metadata\": {},\n    \"private_metadata\": {},\n    \"max_allowed_memberships\": 5\n  },\n  \"object\": \"event\",\n  \"type\": \"organization.created\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1654012591835,\n  \"instance_id\": \"ins_123\"\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Testing Locally\n\n1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your local server:\n   ```bash\n   ngrok http 3000\n   ```\n2. Add the ngrok URL as your webhook endpoint in Clerk Dashboard\n3. Use the **Testing** tab in Clerk to send example events\n\n### 8. Retry Behavior\n\nClerk uses Svix for webhook delivery which automatically retries failed webhooks with exponential backoff. If your handler returns a non-2xx status code, Svix will retry multiple times over several hours.","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and verify Clerk webhooks for organization events (specifically `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted`) and show, with example handler logic or pseudo-code, how to branch on `event.type` to create/update/delete corresponding organization records (or sync data) in the application’s backend, including basic security (signature verification) and reliability (handling retries/async nature).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","timestamp":154824},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":154824},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Tw7ucMisp7bnV5s7TVm8LB","status":"completed","timestamp":154824},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":154824},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012TAHgBPvYyu29e639qBfXd","status":"completed","timestamp":154824},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BUfY3K5JoPZVkQyHzi1bFQ","status":"completed","timestamp":154824},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MQpeg4Witseihjbg6SZGeU","status":"completed","timestamp":154824},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017vKEb67QiarcXwZ9j1owFE","status":"completed","timestamp":154824},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's how to handle Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` in 2026:\n\n## Handling Clerk Organization Webhook Events\n\n### 1.

Here are the main strategies:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: i18n4k Library (Gradle Plugin + Code Generation)**\n\nThe **i18n4k** library is a mature multiplatform solution that uses a Gradle plugin for code generation (not KSP directly, but similar pattern):\n\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    id(\"de.comahe.i18n4k\") version \"0.11.1\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core:0.11.1\") // for commonMain\n}\n\ni18n4k {\n    sourceCodeLocales = listOf(\"en\", \"de\")\n}\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Type-safe accessors generated from `.properties` files\n- Supports parameters: `\"Hello, {0}!\"` → `LocalizedStringFactory1`\n- Works across JVM, JS, Native, WASM, Android, iOS\n- No runtime resource loading needed (inline storing option)\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Custom KSP Processor with KotlinPoet**\n\nFor more control, you can build a custom KSP processor. This approach is documented in Thomas Kioko's 2025 article and uses KotlinPoet for code generation:\n\n```kotlin\n// Define annotations\n@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)\nannotation class LocalizedStrings\n\n// KSP Processor generates sealed classes like:\nsealed class StringResourceKey(val resourceId: StringResource) {\n    data object ButtonErrorRetry : StringResourceKey(MR.strings.button_error_retry)\n    data object TraktDialogLoginTitle : StringResourceKey(MR.strings.trakt_dialog_login_title)\n}\n```\n\n**Setup your KSP processor:**\n\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\") version \"2.3.5\"\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    ksp(project(\":i18n-generator\"))\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: MokoResources + Custom KSP Wrapper**\n\nCombine **MokoResources** (for cross-platform resource handling) with a KSP-based wrapper for enhanced type safety:\n\n```kotlin\n// Localizer interface (api module)\ninterface Localizer {\n    fun getString(key: StringResourceKey): String\n    fun getString(key: StringResourceKey, vararg args: Any): String\n    fun getPlural(key: PluralsResourceKey, quantity: Int): String\n}\n\n// Platform implementations via expect/actual\n@Inject\nactual class PlatformLocalizer(private val context: Context) {\n    actual fun localized(stringDesc: StringDesc): String = stringDesc.toString(context)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key 2026 Best Practices**\n\n1. **Migrate from KAPT to KSP** - KAPT is deprecated; KSP offers 2x faster builds\n2. **Use KSP 2.3.x+** - Latest versions have full AGP 9.0 compatibility (check for updates)\n3. **Modular architecture** - Separate into `:i18n:api`, `:i18n:implementation`, `:i18n:generator`\n4. **Type-safe keys** - Generate sealed classes/enums for compile-time safety\n5. **Test resources independently** - Use abstract test classes with platform implementations\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Start with i18n4k**\n\n1. Add properties files to `src/commonMain/i18n/`:\n   ```properties\n   # Messages_en.properties\n   sayHello=Hello, {0}!\n   title=Welcome\n   ```\n\n2. Generated code provides type-safe access:\n   ```kotlin\n   println(Messages.sayHello(\"World\")) // \"Hello, World!\"\n   ```\n\n3. Change locale at runtime:\n   ```kotlin\n   val config = I18n4kConfigDefault()\n   i18n4k = config\n   config.locale = Locale(\"de\")\n   ```\n\nFor custom KSP processors, use the official KSP documentation at [kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html) and leverage KotlinPoet for Kotlin code generation.","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and run a KSP processor in a modern (K2-era) Kotlin Multiplatform project (e.g., using `ksp<target>`/`ksp<SourceSet>` and `kspCommonMainMetadata`) and show how that processor is used to generate type‑safe i18n resources or accessors from source files (such as message bundles) that work across platforms.

{"id":"websearch-844","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?\nBased on my research, here are the **2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key 2026 Guidelines\n\n### 1. **Mandatory Edge-to-Edge Display (Android 16 / API 36)**\n- Starting with **Android 16 (API level 36)**, edge-to-edge display is **mandatory** — the opt-out mechanism (`R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement`) that existed in Android 15 has been **removed and deprecated**\n- Apps must display content spanning from the top edge to the bottom edge of the screen, drawing behind transparent system bars\n\n### 2. **Timeline Requirements**\n- **Q2 2026**: New apps must target Android 15 (API 35)\n- **August 31, 2026**: Deadline for apps targeting Android 16 (API 36)\n- **Q2 2027**: All app updates must target Android 16 (API 36)\n\n### 3. **Proper Inset Handling Requirements**\n\n**For gesture navigation insets:**\n- Use `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars()` to get system bar insets\n- Use `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures()` for gesture-navigational areas that take priority over your app\n- Apply insets via `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener()`:\n\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n    v.updateLayoutParams<MarginLayoutParams> {\n        leftMargin = insets.left\n        bottomMargin = insets.bottom  // Critical for gesture navigation bar\n        rightMargin = insets.right\n    }\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Best Practices for 2026**\n- **Consume insets once** to prevent double-application (common bug causing UI glitches)\n- Use **Material 3's Scaffold** in Jetpack Compose — it automatically handles nav bars, status bars, and keyboard insets\n- For bottom-anchored content, apply `safe-area-inset-bottom` padding to prevent content from appearing under the gesture navigation bar\n- Avoid hardcoded paddings — use inset-aware APIs instead\n- Don't forget bottom padding for scrollable content (especially important for 3-button navigation which is taller than gesture bar)\n\n### 5. **Types of Insets to Handle**\n- **System bars insets**: Status bar and navigation bar areas\n- **Display cutout insets**: For notches and device-specific screen cutouts\n- **System gesture insets**: Areas reserved for system gestures (swipe from edges)\n- **IME insets**: Keyboard-related insets","hint":"A correct answer must mention the modern Android edge-to-edge requirements (Android 15+ / 2026-era) and explain handling WindowInsets for both system bar insets and

Use `spawn` Start Method (Critical for CUDA)\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)  # Always set this before any CUDA ops\n    # Your code here\n```\n\n### 2. Initialize CUDA Inside Worker Processes, Not Before Spawning\n```python\n# WRONG - causes deadlock\nmodel = MyModel().cuda()  # CUDA initialized in parent\nmp.spawn(worker, args=(model,))\n\n# CORRECT\ndef worker(rank, world_size):\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)  # Initialize CUDA inside worker\n    model = MyModel().cuda(rank)\n    # ... training code\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    mp.spawn(worker, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size)\n```\n\n### 3.

For Multi-GPU Training (DDP), Set Up Process Group Correctly\n```python\nimport torch.distributed as dist\n\ndef setup(rank, world_size):\n    os.environ[\"MASTER_ADDR\"] = \"127.0.0.1\"\n    os.environ[\"MASTER_PORT\"] = \"29500\"\n    dist.init_process_group(\"nccl\", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)\n\ndef cleanup():\n    dist.destroy_process_group()\n```\n\n### 7.

Here are the effective conventions:\n\n### Package Naming Rules:\n\n1. **Use lowercase, single-word names** — By convention, packages should be given lower case, single-word names. There should be no need for underscores or mixedCaps (e.g., `http`, `bufio`, `strconv`).\n\n2. **Short, concise, and evocative** — Package names should be brief yet descriptive enough that users can understand the package's purpose.\n\n3. **Match directory name** — By convention, the package name should be the base name of its source directory. For example, a package in `src/encoding/base64` is imported as `\"encoding/base64\"` but has the name `base64`, not `encoding_base64` or `encodingBase64`.\n\n4. **Avoid stuttering** — Don't repeat the package name in exported function/type names. If your package is named `extract`, name your function `Names()` not `ExtractNames()`, since callers will write `extract.Names()`.\n\n5. **Avoid generic names** — Names like `util`, `common`, `misc`, or `helpers` are discouraged as they don't convey meaning.\n\n### Should a File Have the Same Name as Its Package?\n\n**No, this is not required or expected in Go.**\n\nKey points from the official style guides:\n\n- **Filenames are NOT Go identifiers** and do not have to follow the same naming conventions as packages (per Google's Go Style Decisions guide).\n\n- **There is no \"one type, one file\" convention** in Go, unlike some other languages.\n\n- **Go is flexible about file organization** — maintainers can move code within a package from one file to another without affecting callers.\n\n- Files within a directory must all declare the same `package` clause, but the individual filenames can be anything descriptive of their contents (e.g., `reader.go`, `writer.go`, `utils.go` all in package `bufio`).\n\n- **File naming conventions**: Use lowercase with underscores to separate words if needed (e.g., `http_server.go`, `string_utils.go`). Files with OS and architecture-specific suffixes like `_linux.go` or `_amd64.go` have special build constraint meanings.\n\n### Summary\n\nPackage names should be short, lowercase, single-word identifiers that match the directory name.

This allows you to see the permission warning update flow.\n\n### Method 2: Use the Extension Update Testing Tool (Recommended for 2026)\n\nChrome has released the **Extension Update Testing Tool** - a local extension update server specifically designed for testing updates to Chrome extensions during local development, including permission grants.\n\n**Key benefits:**\n- Shows the user's actual update flow\n- Tests keeping an extension disabled until a user grants newly requested permissions\n- Simulates the real-world experience of permission updates\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Unpacked extensions don't show permission warnings** - This is by design, so you must pack your extension to see warnings\n- **Permission changes that trigger warnings will disable the extension** until the user accepts the new permissions\n- **Check the [permissions list](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/permissions-list)** to see which permissions display warnings\n- For **Manifest V3 extensions**, refer to the [Permission Warning guidelines](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/permission-warnings)\n\n### Testing Permission Updates Workflow\n\n1.

This allows you to see the permission warning update flow.\n\n### Method 2: Use the Extension Update Testing Tool (Recommended for 2026)\n\nChrome has released the **Extension Update Testing Tool** - a local extension update server specifically designed for testing updates to Chrome extensions during local development, including permission grants.\n\n**Key benefits:**\n- Shows the user's actual update flow\n- Tests keeping an extension disabled until a user grants newly requested permissions\n- Simulates the real-world experience of permission updates\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Unpacked extensions don't show permission warnings** - This is by design, so you must pack your extension to see warnings\n- **Permission changes that trigger warnings will disable the extension** until the user accepts the new permissions\n- **Check the [permissions list](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/permissions-list)** to see which permissions display warnings\n- For **Manifest V3 extensions**, refer to the [Permission Warning guidelines](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/permission-warnings)\n\n### Testing Permission Updates Workflow\n\n1.

Align Go Versions**\n```bash\n# Check your current Go version\ngo version\n\n# Update go.mod to match your installed version\ngo mod edit -go=1.26\n\n# Or use go mod tidy to clean up\ngo mod tidy\n```\n\n**2. Fix Invalid Version Formats**\n```bash\n# Edit go.mod directly or use:\ngo mod edit -go=1.26\n```\n\n**3. For GOEXPERIMENT Issues (Go 1.25+)**\n```bash\n# Run govulncheck without the experimental flag\nunset GOEXPERIMENT\ngovulncheck ./...\n\n# Or explicitly disable jsonv2\nGOEXPERIMENT= govulncheck ./...\n```\n\n**4. Specify Correct Go Version for CI/CD**\n- Use the `go-version-file: 'go.mod'` option in GitHub Actions with `actions/setup-go` to ensure consistency\n- Keep govulncheck-vulndb updated for accurate vulnerability data\n\n**5. For Workspace Issues**\n```bash\n# Navigate to specific module directory\ncd ./my-module\ngovulncheck ./...\n\n# Or ensure all workspace modules use compatible Go versions\n```\n\n**6. Keep Tools Updated**\n- As of 2026, govulncheck v1.1.4+ includes false positive reductions and database sync improvements\n- Go 1.26 (RC1 released December 2024, full release expected February 2026) addresses many compatibility issues\n\n**7.

{"id":"websearch-1049","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation\nNow I have comprehensive information to provide a complete answer. Let me summarize the key documentation and setup guide for web push notifications on Safari iOS 16.4+:\n\n## How to Set Up Web Push Notifications for Safari iOS 16.4+ (Add to Home Screen Push API)\n\n### Overview\nStarting with iOS and iPadOS 16.4 (released March 2023), Apple now supports Web Push notifications for web apps added to the Home Screen. This uses the same W3C standards-based Web Push that works on other browsers.\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. **Device Requirements:**\n   - iOS or iPadOS 16.4 or later\n   - Supported browsers: Safari, Chrome, and Edge\n\n2. **Web App Requirements:**\n   - Must be added to the user's Home Screen (not just viewed in browser)\n   - Must have a valid **Web App Manifest** file with `display` set to `standalone` or `fullscreen`\n   - Must use **HTTPS**\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Create a Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"AppName\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-512.png\", \n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"your-unique-app-id\"\n}\n```\n\nLink it in your HTML:\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n#### 2. Register a Service Worker\n```javascript\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered');\n    });\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Request Push Permission (Must be triggered by user interaction)\n```javascript\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n  \n  // Request notification permission\n  const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n  \n  if (permission === 'granted') {\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY)\n    });\n    \n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n  }\n}\n\n// IMPORTANT: Must be called from a user interaction (button click)\ndocument.getElementById('subscribe-btn').addEventListener('click', subscribeToPush);\n```\n\n#### 4. Handle Push Events in Service Worker (`sw.js`)\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('push', event => {\n  const data = event.data.json();\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data.title, {\n      body: data.body,\n      icon: '/icon-192.png',\n      badge: '/badge.png'\n    })\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', event => {\n  event.notification.close();\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow('/')\n  );\n});\n```\n\n#### 5. Server-Side: Send Push Notifications\nUse a library like `web-push` (Node.js):\n```javascript\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your@email.com',\n  VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY,\n  VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY\n);\n\n// Allow Apple Push Notification service URLs: *.push.apple.com\nawait webpush.sendNotification(subscription, JSON.stringify({\n  title: 'Hello!',\n  body: 'This is a push notification'\n}));\n```\n\n### Key Differences from Other Browsers\n\n| Aspect | Safari iOS | Chrome/Firefox |\n|--------|-----------|----------------|\n| Home Screen | **Required** - user must add to Home Screen | Not required |\n| Permission Request | Must be from **user interaction** (button tap) | Can be on page load (though discouraged) |\n| APNs Certificate | **Not required** - no Apple Developer Program membership needed | N/A |\n\n### User Onboarding Flow\n\n1. **Guide users to add your site to Home Screen:**\n   - Display a banner/prompt encouraging \"Add to Home Screen\"\n   - Use Share button → \"Add to Home Screen\"\n\n2. **Once opened as Home Screen web app:**\n   - Show a subscribe button\n   - Request permission only after user taps the button\n   - App will appear in App Switcher and have its own notification settings\n\n### Additional Features (iOS 16.4+)\n\n- **Badging API:** Set app badge count with `navigator.setAppBadge(count)`\n- **Focus Integration:** Notifications integrate with iOS Focus modes\n- **Apple Watch:** Notifications appear on paired Apple Watch\n- **Manifest ID:** Unique identifier for syncing Focus settings across devices\n\n### Network Requirements\n\nEnsure your server can communicate with Apple's push service:\n- Allow URLs from `*.push.apple.com`\n\n### Feature Detection (Best Practice)\n```javascript\nconst isPushSupported = 'PushManager' in window && \n  'showNotification' in ServiceWorkerRegistration.prototype;\n\nif (isPushSupported && !window.matchMedia('(display-mode: browser)').matches) {\n  // Running as installed Home Screen web app - can request push\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the W3C standards-based Web Push and will work across Safari iOS, Chrome, Edge, and desktop browsers.","hint":"A correct answer must explain that web push on iOS/iPadOS only works for Safari-installed Home Screen web apps (PWAs) on iOS 16.4+ and must outline the core technical setup: HTTPS PWA with web app manifest and service worker, using the standard Push API/Notification API flow (register service worker, request permission on a user gesture inside the Home Screen app, obtain push subscription, and send via Apple’s Web Push/APNs endpoints) in line with Apple’s 2025/modern documentation.【page2websearch1 page6websearch1 page7websearch1 page9websearch1 page12websearch1 page16websearch1 page18websearch1","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":71075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":71075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018PPGkWR4B5h92s7XNwK1FP","status":"completed","timestamp":71075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":71075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011jPzsdc9CbeTzZQRHRrsej","status":"completed","timestamp":71075},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have comprehensive information to provide a complete answer.

Server-Side: Send Push Notifications\nUse a library like `web-push` (Node.js):\n```javascript\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your@email.com',\n  VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY,\n  VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY\n);\n\n// Allow Apple Push Notification service URLs: *.push.apple.com\nawait webpush.sendNotification(subscription, JSON.stringify({\n  title: 'Hello!',\n  body: 'This is a push notification'\n}));\n```\n\n### Key Differences from Other Browsers\n\n| Aspect | Safari iOS | Chrome/Firefox |\n|--------|-----------|----------------|\n| Home Screen | **Required** - user must add to Home Screen | Not required |\n| Permission Request | Must be from **user interaction** (button tap) | Can be on page load (though discouraged) |\n| APNs Certificate | **Not required** - no Apple Developer Program membership needed | N/A |\n\n### User Onboarding Flow\n\n1. **Guide users to add your site to Home Screen:**\n   - Display a banner/prompt encouraging \"Add to Home Screen\"\n   - Use Share button → \"Add to Home Screen\"\n\n2. **Once opened as Home Screen web app:**\n   - Show a subscribe button\n   - Request permission only after user taps the button\n   - App will appear in App Switcher and have its own notification settings\n\n### Additional Features (iOS 16.4+)\n\n- **Badging API:** Set app badge count with `navigator.setAppBadge(count)`\n- **Focus Integration:** Notifications integrate with iOS Focus modes\n- **Apple Watch:** Notifications appear on paired Apple Watch\n- **Manifest ID:** Unique identifier for syncing Focus settings across devices\n\n### Network Requirements\n\nEnsure your server can communicate with Apple's push service:\n- Allow URLs from `*.push.apple.com`\n\n### Feature Detection (Best Practice)\n```javascript\nconst isPushSupported = 'PushManager' in window && \n  'showNotification' in ServiceWorkerRegistration.prototype;\n\nif (isPushSupported && !window.matchMedia('(display-mode: browser)').matches) {\n  // Running as installed Home Screen web app - can request push\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the W3C standards-based Web Push and will work across Safari iOS, Chrome, Edge, and desktop browsers.","timestamp":71075}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Web_API","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-1049","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770376783003,"end":1770376854078,"firstResponse":71075,"sessionCreation":1,"total":71075},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

It provides a visual interface (GUI) to manage version control of your files—perfect for writers, designers, researchers, or anyone who wants better file management.\n\n### Why Use GitHub Desktop?\n\nAs a non-programmer, you probably currently manage files like this:\n- `document.docx`\n- `document_final.docx`\n- `document_FINAL_v2.docx`\n- `document_REALLY_FINAL.docx`\n\nGitHub Desktop eliminates this chaos by:\n- Tracking every change you make\n- Letting you go back to any previous version\n- Showing who made what changes and when\n- Enabling easy collaboration with others\n\n---\n\n### Getting Started: Step-by-Step\n\n#### Step 1: Download and Install\n1. Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)\n2. Download the app for your operating system (Windows or macOS)\n3. Run the installer and follow the prompts\n\n#### Step 2: Create a GitHub Account\n1. Visit [github.com](https://github.com)\n2. Sign up for a free account\n3. Verify your email address\n\n#### Step 3: Sign In to GitHub Desktop\n1. Open GitHub Desktop\n2. Click **\"Sign in to GitHub.com\"**\n3. Enter your credentials to authenticate\n\n#### Step 4: Create Your First Repository\nA **repository** (or \"repo\") is simply a folder that GitHub tracks:\n1. Click **File > New Repository**\n2. Give it a name (e.g., \"my-project\")\n3. Choose where to save it on your computer\n4. Click **Create Repository**\n\n---\n\n### Basic Workflow: The 3 Key Actions\n\n#### 1. **Make Changes**\nSimply edit your files normally in the folder GitHub Desktop is tracking—use Word, Notepad, any program you like.\n\n#### 2. **Commit Changes**\nA **commit** is like saving a snapshot of your work:\n1. Open GitHub Desktop—it shows all changes you've made\n2. Write a brief summary of what you changed (e.g., \"Updated chapter 2\")\n3. Click **\"Commit to main\"**\n\n#### 3. **Push to GitHub**\n**Pushing** uploads your commits to GitHub's servers (backup + sharing):\n1. Click **\"Push origin\"** button\n2.

Small, frequent commits are easier to track than massive ones.\n\n3. **Use branches for experiments** – Want to try rewriting a section? Create a branch. If you don't like it, just delete the branch. Your original stays safe.\n\n4. **Sync regularly** – Click \"Fetch origin\" to see if collaborators made changes, then \"Pull\" to get them.\n\n---\n\n### Common Tasks\n\n**To clone an existing repository:**\n1. Click **File > Clone Repository**\n2. Choose from your GitHub repos or paste a URL\n3. Select where to save it locally\n\n**To see your change history:**\n1.

See the [Public MCP Guide](https://support.meetgeek.ai/en/articles/13491658-public-mcp-cloud-guide) for details.\n\n---\n\n### Available Tools\n\nOnce connected, you can use these functions:\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `list_user_meetings` | Retrieve paginated list of your past meetings |\n| `list_team_meetings` | Get meetings for a specific team |\n| `get_meeting_details` | Fetch full details (title, duration, participants, etc.) |\n| `get_meeting_transcript` | Full transcript with speaker names and timestamps |\n| `get_meeting_summary` | AI-generated summary with action items |\n| `get_meeting_highlights` | Key moments, decisions, and notable quotes |\n| `get_meeting_insights` | Sentiment analysis, topic breakdowns, engagement metrics |\n| `upload_recording_for_analysis` | Upload audio/video for AI analysis |\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **\"Module not found\"** → Run `npm install` in the project root\n- **Invalid API key** → Verify your key in MeetGeek Settings → Integrations → Public API\n- **Client doesn't see tools** → Ensure server is running after build; restart your client","timestamp":66113}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"MeetGeek","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-1268","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770376931459,"end":1770376997572,"firstResponse":66113,"sessionCreation":0,"total":66113},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

monorepo 2026 tutorial\nLet me get more detailed content from the most comprehensive and recent guides:\nLet me try other sources:\nBased on my comprehensive research, here is a **complete guide to setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo (2026)**:\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up shadcn UI in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Tutorial)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe recommended approach uses **pnpm workspaces** + **Turborepo** with a centralized `@workspace/ui` package that shares shadcn/ui components across multiple applications.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Create the Turborepo\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest my-monorepo\ncd my-monorepo\n```\n\nThis creates a structure like:\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/                 # Next.js application\n├── packages/\n│   ├── ui/                  # Shared UI components package\n│   ├── eslint-config/       # Shared ESLint configuration\n│   └── typescript-config/   # Shared TypeScript configuration\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Set Up the UI Package\n\n### 2.1 Configure `packages/ui/package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": \"^4.0.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^4.0.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.3.0\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.2.0\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^18 || ^19\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18 || ^19\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.2 Create the folder structure\n\n```\npackages/ui/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/      # shadcn components go here\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts     # cn() utility\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   └── styles/\n│       └── globals.css  # Tailwind + shadcn theme\n├── components.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.mjs\n└── tsconfig.json\n```\n\n### 2.3 Create `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\"\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\"\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Create `packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### 2.5 Create `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` (Tailwind v4)\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n/* Scan all packages and apps for Tailwind classes */\n@source \"../../apps/*/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../../apps/*/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n\n@theme inline {\n  --color-background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --color-foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --color-primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n  --color-primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);\n  --color-secondary: oklch(0.97 0

0);\n  /* ... dark mode variables */\n}\n```\n\n### 2.6 Create `packages/ui/components.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Configure the Next.js Application\n\n### 3.1 Update `apps/web/package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@workspace/ui\": \"workspace:*\",\n    \"next\": \"^15.0.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.2 Create `apps/web/components.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.3 Update `apps/web/tsconfig.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@workspace/typescript-config/nextjs.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@workspace/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/src/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"**/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 3.4 Import global styles in your app\n\nIn `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nimport \"@workspace/ui/globals.css\"\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Install shadcn Components\n\nRun the CLI from the **UI package directory**:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input\n```\n\nThis installs components to `packages/ui/src/components/`.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Use Components in Your App\n\n```tsx\n// apps/web/app/page.tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Button>Click me!</Button>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Configure Turborepo (`turbo.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://turbo.build/schema.json\",\n  \"tasks\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"],\n      \"outputs\": [\".next/**\", \"dist/**\"]\n    },\n    \"dev\": {\n      \"cache\": false,\n      \"persistent\": true\n    },\n    \"lint\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n| Aspect | Configuration |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Package Manager** | pnpm workspaces with `workspace:*` protocol |\n| **Task Runner** | Turborepo for parallel builds and caching |\n| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-first configuration |\n| **Component Location** | Centralized in `packages/ui/src/components/` |\n| **CLI Installation** | Run `shadcn add` from the `packages/ui` directory |\n| **Import Pattern** | `@workspace/ui/components/button` |\n\n---\n\n## Official Template\n\nshadcn/ui provides an official monorepo template at:\n- **GitHub**: `shadcn-ui/ui/templates/monorepo-next`\n- **Docs**: https://ui.shadcn.com/monorepo\n\nThis setup gives you a fully functional Turborepo with shared shadcn/ui components, Tailwind v4, and Next.js working together seamlessly across multiple applications.","hint":"A correct answer must explain how to initialize and configure shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo, including using the shadcn CLI with

\"^2.2.0\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^18 || ^19\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18 || ^19\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.2 Create the folder structure\n\n```\npackages/ui/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/      # shadcn components go here\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts     # cn() utility\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   └── styles/\n│       └── globals.css  # Tailwind + shadcn theme\n├── components.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.mjs\n└── tsconfig.json\n```\n\n### 2.3 Create `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\"\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\"\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))\n}\n```\n\n### 2.4 Create `packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### 2.5 Create `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` (Tailwind v4)\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n/* Scan all packages and apps for Tailwind classes */\n@source \"../../apps/*/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../../apps/*/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n\n@theme inline {\n  --color-background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --color-foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n

`packages/ui/components.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Configure the Next.js Application\n\n### 3.1 Update `apps/web/package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@workspace/ui\": \"workspace:*\",\n    \"next\": \"^15.0.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.2 Create `apps/web/components.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.3 Update `apps/web/tsconfig.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@workspace/typescript-config/nextjs.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@workspace/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/src/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"**/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 3.4 Import global styles in your app\n\nIn `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nimport \"@workspace/ui/globals.css\"\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Install shadcn Components\n\nRun the CLI from the **UI package directory**:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input\n```\n\nThis installs components to `packages/ui/src/components/`.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Use Components in Your App\n\n```tsx\n// apps/web/app/page.tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Button>Click me!</Button>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Configure Turborepo (`turbo.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://turbo.build/schema.json\",\n  \"tasks\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"],\n      \"outputs\": [\".next/**\", \"dist/**\"]\n    },\n    \"dev\": {\n      \"cache\": false,\n      \"persistent\": true\n    },\n    \"lint\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n| Aspect | Configuration |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Package Manager** | pnpm workspaces with `workspace:*` protocol |\n| **Task Runner** | Turborepo for parallel builds and caching |\n| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-first configuration |\n| **Component Location** | Centralized in `packages/ui/src/components/` |\n| **CLI Installation** | Run `shadcn add` from the `packages/ui` directory |\n| **Import Pattern** | `@workspace/ui/components/button` |\n\n---\n\n## Official Template\n\nshadcn/ui provides an official monorepo template at:\n- **GitHub**: `shadcn-ui/ui/templates/monorepo-next`\n- **Docs**: https://ui.shadcn.com/monorepo\n\nThis setup gives you a fully functional Turborepo with shared shadcn/ui

{"id":"websearch-1330","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to build a full-width responsive image slider using Next.js Image component and Swiper in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Full-Width Responsive Image Slider with Next.js Image & Swiper\n\n### 1. Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n# or\nyarn add swiper\n```\n\n### 2. Create the Slider Component\n\nSince Swiper uses browser APIs, you must mark it as a client component in Next.js App Router:\n\n```tsx\n// components/ImageSlider.tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport 'swiper/css/effect-fade';\n\ninterface SlideImage {\n  src: string;\n  alt: string;\n}\n\ninterface ImageSliderProps {\n  images: SlideImage[];\n  autoplay?: boolean;\n  effect?: 'slide' | 'fade';\n}\n\nexport default function ImageSlider({ \n  images, \n  autoplay = true,\n  effect = 'slide' \n}: ImageSliderProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-full relative\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={autoplay ? { delay: 5000, disableOnInteraction: false } : false}\n        effect={effect}\n        loop={true}\n        className=\"w-full\"\n        style={{ width: '100%' }}\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-[50vh] md:h-[70vh] lg:h-[80vh]\">\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                priority={index === 0} // Prioritize first image for LCP\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Key Concepts Explained\n\n#### Using `fill` with Next.js Image\n- Use the **`fill`** prop when you want the image to fill its parent container\n- The parent must have `position: relative` and defined dimensions\n- Use **`sizes=\"100vw\"`** for full-width images to optimize responsive loading\n- Set **`objectFit: 'cover'`** via style prop to maintain aspect ratio\n\n#### Responsive Breakpoints with Swiper\n```tsx\n<Swiper\n  breakpoints={{\n    0: {\n      slidesPerView: 1,\n      spaceBetween: 10,\n    },\n    768: {\n      slidesPerView: 1,\n      spaceBetween: 20,\n    },\n    1024: {\n      slidesPerView: 1,\n      spaceBetween: 30,\n    },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n### 4. Usage in a Page\n\n```tsx\n// app/page.tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider';\n\nconst images = [\n  { src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <ImageSlider images={images} autoplay={true} effect=\"fade\" />\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. For Remote Images\n\nConfigure `next.config.js` to allow external image sources:\n\n```js\n// next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'your-image-domain.com',\n        pathname: '/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### 6. Custom Styling (CSS Module or Tailwind)\n\n```css\n/* styles/slider.module.css */\n.sliderContainer {\n  width: 100%;\n  position: relative;\n}\n\n.slideWrapper {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 80vh;\n}\n\n/* Custom navigation arrows */\n.sliderContainer :global(.swiper-button-next),\n.sliderContainer :global(.swiper-button-prev) {\n  color: white;\n}\n\n/* Custom pagination */\n.sliderContainer :global(.swiper-pagination-bullet-active) {\n  background: white;\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Use `priority` on the first slide** to optimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n2. **Use `sizes` attribute** properly: `sizes=\"100vw\"` for full-width sliders\n3. **Add `placeholder=\"blur\"`** for local images to prevent layout shift\n4. **Consider lazy loading** - Swiper's virtual slides module for large galleries\n5. **Use `fill` instead of fixed width/height** for responsive full-width images\n\n### Complete Example with All Features\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade, Lazy } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport 'swiper/css/effect-fade';\n\nconst slides = [\n  { src: '/hero-1.jpg', alt: 'Hero Image 1' },\n  { src: '/hero-2.jpg', alt: 'Hero Image 2' },\n  { src: '/hero-3.jpg', alt: 'Hero Image 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function FullWidthSlider() {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"w-full\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade]}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{ delay: 4000, disableOnInteraction: false }}\n        loop\n        effect=\"fade\"\n        fadeEffect={{ crossFade: true }}\n      >\n        {slides.map((slide, i) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={i}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-screen\">\n              <Image\n                src={slide.src}\n                alt={slide.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                priority={i === 0}\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                quality={85}\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis approach combines the power of Swiper's touch-friendly, mobile-optimized slider with Next.js Image's automatic optimization (lazy loading, responsive srcset, WebP/AVIF conversion, and blur placeholders).","hint":"A correct answer should describe using Swiper’s React integration with Next.js in a client component (`'use client'`), importing `Swiper`/`SwiperSlide` and Swiper CSS, and rendering slides that use the Next.js `Image` component (typically with `fill`/responsive layout and parent with relative positioning) to achieve a full-width, responsive slider; it should also mention configuring Swiper options (e.g., breakpoints or `slidesPerView`, navigation/pagination) so the slider adapts to different screen sizes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":92780},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":92780},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01L7qVzv1swZjau1msp1iJ8j","status":"completed","timestamp":92780},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":92780},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KPFvvjh5L1muoJSrG6gmgQ","status":"completed","timestamp":92780},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to build a full-width responsive image slider using Next.js Image component and Swiper in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Full-Width Responsive Image Slider with Next.js Image & Swiper\n\n### 1.

Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Use `priority` on the first slide** to optimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n2. **Use `sizes` attribute** properly: `sizes=\"100vw\"` for full-width sliders\n3. **Add `placeholder=\"blur\"`** for local images to prevent layout shift\n4. **Consider lazy loading** - Swiper's virtual slides module for large galleries\n5. **Use `fill` instead of fixed width/height** for responsive full-width images\n\n### Complete Example with All Features\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade, Lazy } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport 'swiper/css/effect-fade';\n\nconst slides = [\n  { src: '/hero-1.jpg', alt: 'Hero Image 1' },\n  { src: '/hero-2.jpg', alt: 'Hero Image 2' },\n  { src: '/hero-3.jpg', alt: 'Hero Image 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function FullWidthSlider() {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"w-full\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade]}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{ delay: 4000, disableOnInteraction: false }}\n        loop\n        effect=\"fade\"\n        fadeEffect={{ crossFade: true }}\n      >\n        {slides.map((slide, i) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={i}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-screen\">\n              <Image\n                src={slide.src}\n                alt={slide.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                priority={i === 0}\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                quality={85}\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis approach combines the power of Swiper's touch-friendly, mobile-optimized slider with Next.js Image's automatic optimization (lazy loading, responsive srcset, WebP/AVIF conversion, and blur placeholders).","timestamp":92780}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Next.js_Image_Slider","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-1330","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770376951863,"end":1770377044643,"firstResponse":92780,"sessionCreation":0,"total":92780},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Configure via `VADParams`:\n\n```python\nfrom pipecat.audio.vad.silero import SileroVADAnalyzer\nfrom pipecat.audio.vad.vad_analyzer import VADParams\n\nvad_analyzer = SileroVADAnalyzer(\n    params=VADParams(\n        confidence=0.7,    # Minimum confidence threshold (default: 0.7)\n        start_secs=0.2,    # Time before confirming speech start (default: 0.2)\n        stop_secs=0.8,     # Time before confirming speech stop (default: 0.8)\n        min_volume=0.6,    # Minimum audio volume threshold (default: 0.6)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n**Key parameters:**\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `confidence` | 0.7 | Voice detection confidence threshold (0-1) |\n| `start_secs` | 0.2 | Seconds of speech before transitioning to SPEAKING state |\n| `stop_secs` | 0.8 | Seconds of silence before transitioning to QUIET state |\n| `min_volume` | 0.6 | Minimum volume threshold for voice detection |\n\n### 2. **Deepgram LiveOptions Configuration**\n\nWhen configuring `DeepgramSTTService`, use `LiveOptions` for utterance detection:\n\n```python\nfrom deepgram import LiveOptions\nfrom pipecat.services.deepgram.stt import DeepgramSTTService\n\nlive_options = LiveOptions(\n    model=\"nova-2\",\n    language=\"en-US\",\n    interim_results=True,           # Required for utterance_end_ms\n    smart_format=True,\n    punctuate=True,\n    vad_events=False,               # Deprecated - use pipeline VAD instead\n    utterance_end_ms=\"1000\",        # Gap detection (1000-5000 ms)\n    endpointing=300,                # Silence before finalizing (milliseconds)\n)\n\nstt = DeepgramSTTService(\n    api_key=os.getenv(\"DEEPGRAM_API_KEY\"),\n    live_options=live_options,\n)\n```\n\n**Deepgram utterance parameters:**\n| Parameter | Range | Description |\n|-----------|-------|-------------|\n| `utterance_end_ms` | 1000-5000 ms | Gap duration to trigger UtteranceEnd message |\n| `endpointing` | Any int (ms) or `false` | Silence duration before finalizing speech (default: 10ms) |\n| `interim_results` | `true`/`false` | Required for utterance_end_ms to work |\n| `vad_events` | `true`/`false` | **Deprecated** - triggers SpeechStarted/SpeechStopped events |\n\n### 3. **Smart Turn Integration (2026)**\n\nFor advanced turn detection, combine VAD with Smart Turn:\n\n```python\nfrom pipecat.audio.turn.smart_turn.local_smart_turn_v3 import LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3\n\n# When using Smart Turn, set stop_secs lower (0.2) for faster analysis\nvad_params = VADParams(\n    start_secs=0.2,\n    stop_secs=0.2,  # Lower when using turn detection\n)\n```\n\n### Important Notes for 2026:\n- **Deprecation**: `vad_events` in Deepgram's `LiveOptions` is deprecated since Pipecat v0.0.99\n- **Best Practice**: Use Pipecat's Silero VAD (`SileroVADAnalyzer`) for better performance\n- **Short Utterances**: For detecting quick words like \"yes\"/\"no\", lower `start_secs` (e.g., 0.1-0.15) may help","hint":"A correct answer should identify that Pipecat’s DeepgramSTTService uses Deepgram VAD/utterance options configured via `LiveOptions` (or equivalent) and must name or describe the key utterance/VAD-related flags (e.g., `vad_events` and any speech-start / utterance-end handlers or parameters controlling end-of-utterance detection), clarifying that these are current as of the 2026-era Pipecat/Deepgram integration. It should not invent options unrelated to Deepgram’s live transcription/VAD configuration or to Pipecat’s DeepgramSTTService interface.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the Pipecat DeepgramSTTService VAD utterance configuration options for 2026?","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01L2woHJNxccAs1cjhnemL8V","status":"completed","timestamp":113934},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the official Pipecat documentation page for more detailed configuration options:","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012dLbJseivgH5T7y3kDaas8","status":"completed","timestamp":113934},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about VAD utterance configuration options:","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YQTjHNZw4LWLCpbKuB9w62","status":"completed","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NSwi5rTWL4G3BvfMoGkXFB","status":"completed","timestamp":113934},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for the specific Deepgram utterance_end_ms configuration:","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FbcXvV9ZEDr4AMWeuLhGEg","status":"completed","timestamp":113934},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the Deepgram documentation for more details on the utterance configuration options:","timestamp":113934},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Sp7SpFy8cgicAfhpyzsSmS","status":"completed","timestamp":113934},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have all the information needed.

Kiliána (and the Church of St. Kilian) in Davle in 2026\n\nBased on my research, there are several recurring events connected to this location that are expected to continue in 2026:\n\n### 1. **Poutní slavnost (Pilgrimage Celebration) - Late June 2026**\nSince 1991, every year at the end of June (on the Sunday after the Feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, June 24), a **poutní slavnost** (pilgrimage celebration) takes place on the island. Participants are transported to the island by boat. The 2026 pilgrimage would likely be on **Sunday, June 28, 2026**. This event includes:\n- Mass celebrated outdoors on the monastery ruins\n- Commemorative activities honoring the patron St. John the Baptist\n- The church of St. Kilian on the mainland is also part of the celebrations\n\n### 2. **\"Lodí do kláštera\" (By Boat to the Monastery)**\nThis annual event organized by the Regional Museum in Jílové u Prahy typically takes place in spring (usually May) and offers:\n- Guided tour of the Church of St. Kilian\n- Boat transport to the island\n- Commentary about the medieval monastery of St. John the Baptist\n- The 2023 edition was on May 13; the 2026 date would likely be similar (spring)\n\n### 3. **Archeologické léto (Archaeological Summer) - July/August 2026**\nThe island is part of the \"Archaeological Summer\" program. In 2025, events were held on July 19 and August 9. Similar dates can be expected for 2026, featuring:\n- Guided tours led by archaeologists (Barbora Machová, Jan Mařík)\n- Transport by inflatable boat from the Davle waterfront\n- Presentations about the monastery history and underwater archaeological discoveries\n- Information about artifacts found on the riverbed\n\n**Note:** The Church of St. Kilian (on the mainland) is the only church in the Czech Republic dedicated to St. Kilian, and it holds regular Sunday services at 8:00 AM.\n\nFor specific 2026 dates and registration, check the official websites closer to the events:\n- mestysdavle.cz\n- muzeumjilove.cz\n- archeologickeleto.cz","hint":"A good answer should state that in 2026 a pilgrimage festival/pilgrimage mass (poutní slavnost, mše) is planned/held at or in connection with the church of St. Kilian in Davle and the island Ostrov sv.

This event includes:\n- Mass celebrated outdoors on the monastery ruins\n- Commemorative activities honoring the patron St. John the Baptist\n- The church of St. Kilian on the mainland is also part of the celebrations\n\n### 2. **\"Lodí do kláštera\" (By Boat to the Monastery)**\nThis annual event organized by the Regional Museum in Jílové u Prahy typically takes place in spring (usually May) and offers:\n- Guided tour of the Church of St. Kilian\n- Boat transport to the island\n- Commentary about the medieval monastery of St. John the Baptist\n- The 2023 edition was on May 13; the 2026 date would likely be similar (spring)\n\n### 3. **Archeologické léto (Archaeological Summer) - July/August 2026**\nThe island is part of the \"Archaeological Summer\" program. In 2025, events were held on July 19 and August 9. Similar dates can be expected for 2026, featuring:\n- Guided tours led by archaeologists (Barbora Machová, Jan Mařík)\n- Transport by inflatable boat from the Davle waterfront\n- Presentations about the monastery history and underwater archaeological discoveries\n- Information about artifacts found on the riverbed\n\n**Note:** The Church of St. Kilian (on the mainland) is the only church in the Czech Republic dedicated to St. Kilian, and it holds regular Sunday services at 8:00 AM.\n\nFor specific 2026 dates and registration, check the official websites closer to the events:\n- mestysdavle.cz\n- muzeumjilove.cz\n- archeologickeleto.cz","timestamp":167342}],"metadata":{"category":"General_Knowledge","subcategory":"Czech_Churches","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-1309","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770376933734,"end":1770377101076,"firstResponse":167342,"sessionCreation":0,"total":167342},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

The app allows users to send photos directly to their loved ones' home screens via a widget - creating an intimate, instant way to share moments without the noise of traditional social media feeds.\n\n**The Viral TikTok-First Strategy:**\nLocket's marketing success is a masterclass in **systematic TikTok virality**:\n\n1. **The Initial Spark**: Matt Moss posted a video about Locket on TikTok that went viral, leading to 2 million signups within just two weeks. This wasn't pure luck - it validated a repeatable format.\n\n2. **The Nano-Influencer System**: Locket employed a deliberate strategy using **26+ nano and micro-influencers**, paying them one-off fees to create uniform videos following a specific format. The insight was that on TikTok, **quantity often beats quality** - by distributing similar content across numerous accounts, at least one out of every batch would go viral.\n\n3. **The \"Outlier Game\"**: Locket understood viral success is statistical. To guarantee one viral hit per day, they aimed for 70+ uploads daily across their creator network. This approach generated **298+ million views** and over **250 million views** through their TikTok influencer strategy.\n\n4. **The Three-Hook System**: Their content relied on three main \"hook families\" that consistently performed. Top creators like @kaias_lensss used the same hook dozens of times, consistently getting millions of views.\n\n5. **Response Video Retargeting**: Whenever an influencer's video gained momentum, Locket commissioned response videos to comments - essentially using them as free retargeting for the initial video's audience.\n\n**The Results (by 2025-2026):**\n- 80+ million total downloads\n- 9+ million daily active users\n- Nearly 2 billion photos sent through the app\n- Consistently ranked in the top 5-10 on the App Store\n- Estimated $13.5 million/year revenue\n- Won Apple's **Cultural Impact Award** in 2025\n- Conservative fundraising approach ($12.5M raised by 2022) while achieving profitability\n\n**What Made It Work:**\nThe strategy proved that **turning virality into a repeatable system** - rather than hoping for one-off hits - can drive sustained app growth.

Here's the complete answer:\n\n## How to Use HTX Historical Funding Rate APIs for 2026\n\nHTX (formerly Huobi) provides two main endpoints for fetching historical funding rates depending on the type of contract:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Coin-Margined Swaps** (`/swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate`)\n\n**Base URL:** `https://api.hbdm.com`\n\n**Endpoint:** `GET /swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate`\n\n**Example Request:**\n```bash\ncurl \"https://api.hbdm.com/swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate?contract_code=BTC-USD&page_index=1&page_size=50\"\n```\n\n**Request Parameters:**\n| Parameter | Required | Type | Description | Default |\n|-----------|----------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `contract_code` | Yes | string | Contract code (case-insensitive), e.g., \"BTC-USD\", \"ETH-USD\" | - |\n| `page_index` | No | int | Page number | 1 |\n| `page_size` | No | int | Results per page (max 50) | 20 |\n\n---\n\n### 2. **USDT-Margined Contracts (Linear Swaps)** (`/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate`)\n\n**Base URL:** `https://api.hbdm.com`\n\n**Endpoint:** `GET /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate`\n\n**Example Request:**\n```bash\ncurl \"https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate?contract_code=BTC-USDT&page_index=1&page_size=50\"\n```\n\n**Request Parameters:**\n| Parameter | Required | Type | Description | Default |\n|-----------|----------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `contract_code` | Yes | string | Contract code (case-insensitive), e.g., \"BTC-USDT\", \"ETH-USDT\" | - |\n| `page_index` | No | int | Page number | 1 |\n| `page_size` | No | int | Results per page (max 50) | 20 |\n\n---\n\n### Response Format (Both Endpoints)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"status\": \"ok\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"total_page\": 326,\n        \"current_page\": 1,\n        \"total_size\": 651,\n        \"data\": [\n            {\n                \"avg_premium_index\": \"-0.000862360011416593\",\n                \"funding_rate\": \"0.000100000000000000\",\n                \"realized_rate\": \"0.000099999999999999\",\n                \"funding_time\": \"1603843200000\",\n                \"contract_code\": \"BTC-USD\",\n                \"symbol\": \"BTC\",\n                \"fee_asset\": \"BTC\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"ts\": 1603866438409\n}\n```\n\n**Response Fields:**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `status` | string | \"ok\" or \"error\" |\n| `total_page` | int | Total number of pages |\n| `current_page` | int | Current page number |\n| `total_size` | int | Total number of records |\n| `symbol` | string | Symbol (e.g., \"BTC\", \"ETH\") |\n| `contract_code` | string | Contract code |\n| `fee_asset` | string | Fee asset (e.g., \"BTC\", \"USDT\") |\n| `funding_time` | string | Funding time in milliseconds (Unix timestamp) |\n| `funding_rate` | string | The funding rate |\n| `realized_rate` | string | Actual realized funding rate |\n| `avg_premium_index` | string | Average premium index |\n\n---\n\n### To Get Historical Funding Rates for 2026\n\nSince the API uses pagination without date filters, you'll need to **iterate through pages** to collect all historical data including 2026 records:\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef get_historical_funding_rates(contract_code, start_year=2026):\n    \"\"\"Fetch all historical funding rates for a contract starting from a specific year\"\"\"\n    base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    all_rates = []\n    page = 1\n    \n    while True:\n        params = {\n            \"contract_code\": contract_code,\n            \"page_index\": page,\n            \"page_size\": 50\n        }\n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data[\"status\"] != \"ok\" or not data[\"data\"][\"data\"]:\n            break\n            \n        for record in data[\"data\"][\"data\"]:\n            funding_time = int(record[\"funding_time\"]) / 1000\n            dt = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(funding_time)\n            if dt.year >= start_year:\n                all_rates.append(record)\n        \n        if page >= data[\"data\"][\"total_page\"]:\n            break\n        page += 1\n    \n    return all_rates\n\n# Usage\nrates_2026 = get_historical_funding_rates(\"BTC-USDT\", start_year=2026)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Notes\n\n1. **No Authentication Required**: These are public endpoints - no API key needed.\n2. **Rate Limits**: HTX applies rate limits (generally ~72 requests/3 seconds for read endpoints).\n3. **Funding Interval**: HTX settles funding every 8 hours (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC).\n4. **Date Filter**: The API doesn't support date range filtering, so you must paginate through results and filter by `funding_time`.","hint":"A good answer must explain that historical funding rates are retrieved via the public REST endpoints `/swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate` (coin‑margined) and `/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate` (USDT‑margined), including the need to specify `contract_code` and use pagination parameters like `page_index`/`page_size` rather than a “year=2026” filter, and should note that only data actually available from HTX can be returned (i.e., you cannot fetch future or non‑existent 2026 records).[[1, 2]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use the Huobi HTX /swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate or /linear-swap-api endpoint to get historical funding rates for 2026?","timestamp":66276},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":66276},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013mvcZAzxApA9fQ5q6U4xTT","status":"completed","timestamp":66276},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016Zoa6QekCHCNztNx79w6xe","status":"completed","timestamp":66276},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have some basic information.

|\n| `page_index` | No | int | Page number | 1 |\n| `page_size` | No | int | Results per page (max 50) | 20 |\n\n---\n\n### 2. **USDT-Margined Contracts (Linear Swaps)** (`/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate`)\n\n**Base URL:** `https://api.hbdm.com`\n\n**Endpoint:** `GET /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate`\n\n**Example Request:**\n```bash\ncurl \"https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate?contract_code=BTC-USDT&page_index=1&page_size=50\"\n```\n\n**Request Parameters:**\n| Parameter | Required | Type | Description | Default |\n|-----------|----------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `contract_code` | Yes | string | Contract code (case-insensitive), e.g., \"BTC-USDT\", \"ETH-USDT\" | - |\n| `page_index` | No | int | Page number | 1 |\n| `page_size` | No | int | Results per page (max 50) | 20 |\n\n---\n\n### Response Format (Both Endpoints)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"status\": \"ok\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"total_page\": 326,\n        \"current_page\": 1,\n        \"total_size\": 651,\n        \"data\": [\n            {\n                \"avg_premium_index\": \"-0.000862360011416593\",\n                \"funding_rate\": \"0.000100000000000000\",\n                \"realized_rate\": \"0.000099999999999999\",\n                \"funding_time\": \"1603843200000\",\n                \"contract_code\": \"BTC-USD\",\n                \"symbol\": \"BTC\",\n                \"fee_asset\": \"BTC\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"ts\": 1603866438409\n}\n```\n\n**Response Fields:**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `status` | string | \"ok\" or \"error\" |\n| `total_page` | int | Total number of pages |\n| `current_page` | int | Current page number |\n| `total_size` | int | Total number of records |\n| `symbol` | string | Symbol (e.g., \"BTC\", \"ETH\") |\n| `contract_code` | string | Contract code |\n| `fee_asset` | string | Fee asset (e.g., \"BTC\", \"USDT\") |\n| `funding_time` | string | Funding time in milliseconds (Unix timestamp) |\n| `funding_rate` | string | The funding rate |\n| `realized_rate` | string | Actual realized funding rate |\n| `avg_premium_index` | string | Average premium index |\n\n---\n\n### To Get Historical Funding Rates for 2026\n\nSince the API uses pagination without date filters, you'll need to **iterate through pages** to collect all historical data including 2026 records:\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef get_historical_funding_rates(contract_code, start_year=2026):\n    \"\"\"Fetch all historical funding rates for a contract starting from a specific year\"\"\"\n    base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    all_rates = []\n    page = 1\n    \n    while True:\n        params = {\n            \"contract_code\": contract_code,\n            \"page_index\": page,\n            \"page_size\": 50\n        }\n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data[\"status\"] != \"ok\" or not data[\"data\"][\"data\"]:\n            break\n            \n        for record in data[\"data\"][\"data\"]:\n            funding_time = int(record[\"funding_time\"]) / 1000\n            dt = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(funding_time)\n            if dt.year >= start_year:\n                all_rates.append(record)\n        \n        if page >= data[\"data\"][\"total_page\"]:\n            break\n        page += 1\n    \n    return all_rates\n\n# Usage\nrates_2026 = get_historical_funding_rates(\"BTC-USDT\", start_year=2026)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Notes\n\n1. **No Authentication Required**: These are public endpoints - no API key needed.\n2. **Rate Limits**: HTX applies rate limits (generally ~72 requests/3 seconds for read endpoints).\n3. **Funding Interval**: HTX settles funding every 8 hours (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC).\n4. **Date Filter**: The API doesn't support date range filtering, so you must paginate through results and filter by `funding_time`.","timestamp":66276}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Cryptocurrency Exchange","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-1524","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770377123897,"end":1770377190173,"firstResponse":66276,"sessionCreation":0,"total":66276},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.94,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Creates nodes from SVG strings\n- `figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(jsx)` - Creates nodes using JSX/widget syntax\n\n**Basic example of creating nodes from JSON:**\n\n```typescript\n// Sample JSON structure\nconst designData = {\n  type: \"FRAME\",\n  name: \"Card\",\n  width: 300,\n  height: 200,\n  fills: [{ type: \"SOLID\", color: { r: 1, g: 1, b: 1 } }],\n  children: [\n    { type: \"TEXT\", name: \"Title\", x: 16, y: 16, characters: \"Hello World\" },\n    { type: \"RECTANGLE\", name: \"Button\", x: 16, y: 100, width: 100, height: 40 }\n  ]\n};\n\n// Recursive function to create nodes from JSON\nasync function createNodeFromJSON(data, parent) {\n  let node;\n  \n  switch (data.type) {\n    case \"FRAME\":\n      node = figma.createFrame();\n      break;\n    case \"RECTANGLE\":\n      node = figma.createRectangle();\n      break;\n    case \"TEXT\":\n      node = figma.createText();\n      await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: \"Inter\", style: \"Regular\" });\n      node.characters = data.characters || \"\";\n      break;\n    case \"ELLIPSE\":\n      node = figma.createEllipse();\n      break;\n  }\n  \n  // Apply properties\n  if (data.name) node.name = data.name;\n  if (data.width) node.resize(data.width, data.height || data.width);\n  if (data.x !== undefined) node.x = data.x;\n  if (data.y !== undefined) node.y = data.y;\n  if (data.fills) node.fills = data.fills;\n  \n  // Add to parent or current page\n  if (parent) {\n    parent.appendChild(node);\n  } else {\n    figma.currentPage.appendChild(node);\n  }\n  \n  // Recursively create children\n  if (data.children) {\n    for (const child of data.children) {\n      await createNodeFromJSON(child, node);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return node;\n}\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using Existing Plugins\n\nSeveral community plugins help with JSON-to-Figma workflows:\n\n1. **JSON to Figma** - Import JSON data to populate existing designs\n2. **Figma to JSON Exporter** - Export/import design tokens and components\n3. **Variables Import/Export plugins** - Work with Figma variables via JSON\n\n### Method 3: Using `createNodeFromJSXAsync` (Widget API)\n\nFor more complex structures, use the JSX-based approach:\n\n```typescript\nconst node = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(\n  <Frame width={300} height={200} fill=\"#FFFFFF\">\n    <Text x={16} y={16}>Hello World</Text>\n    <Rectangle x={16} y={100} width={100} height={40} fill=\"#007AFF\" />\n  </Frame>\n);\n```\n\n### Key Tips for 2026\n\n1. **Load fonts first** - Always call `figma.loadFontAsync()` before setting text\n2. **Use async/await** - Many API methods are asynchronous\n3. **Handle node hierarchy** - Use `appendChild()` to build the tree structure\n4. **Map JSON properties to node properties** - Translate your JSON schema to Figma's node properties (fills, strokes, effects, constraints, etc.)\n5. **Consider using design tokens** - Figma's native Variables system supports JSON import/export for colors, typography, and spacing\n\nThe Figma Plugin API documentation at `figma.com/plugin-docs` provides the complete reference for all node types and their properties.","hint":"Reward answers that explain using (or building) a Figma plugin that parses a JSON structure and programmatically creates Figma nodes (frames/components/other SceneNodes) matching that hierarchy via the Figma Plugin API (e.g., `figma.createFrame`, `figma.createComponent`, setting properties/children from JSON), and that mention how this enables importing or reconstructing designs from JSON data rather than manually drawing them.[[1, 2, 3]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","timestamp":54660},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":54660},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019MVSipLKmkyhccDjyWEMLb","status":"completed","timestamp":54660},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01ALgHRPrbPwQGQApKgKv99c","status":"completed","timestamp":54660},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":54660},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01UBMLthfYDhVLi8Tnbm9doU","status":"completed","timestamp":54660},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive answer on how to use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026:\n\n## How to Create Nodes from JSON in Figma Plugins\n\n### Method 1: Using the Figma Plugin API Node Creation Functions\n\nThe Figma Plugin API provides several methods to programmatically create nodes from data structures like JSON:\n\n**Key node creation methods:**\n- `figma.createFrame()` -

Here's what you need to know:\n\n### Understanding the Model Structure\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` response_model has this structure (based on the JSON schema):\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass ExtractedEntity(BaseModel):\n    name: str = Field(description=\"Name of the extracted entity\")\n    entity_type_id: int = Field(description=\"ID of the classified entity type. Must be one of the provided entity_type_id integers.\")\n\nclass ExtractedEntities(BaseModel):\n    extracted_entities: List[ExtractedEntity] = Field(description=\"List of extracted entities\")\n```\n\n### Important: This is an Internal Model\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` model is **not meant to be used directly by developers**. It's part of Graphiti's internal LLM pipeline for entity extraction. When you call `add_episode()`, Graphiti internally:\n\n1. Sends text to the LLM with structured output requirements\n2. Expects the LLM to return data matching the `ExtractedEntities` schema\n3. Validates the response using Pydantic\n\n### Common Validation Errors (Known Issues)\n\nIf you see errors like:\n```\nValidationError: 1 validation error for ExtractedEntities\nextracted_entities\n  Field required [type=missing, ...]\n```\n\nThis typically happens when using **non-OpenAI models** (Ollama, Deepseek, Kimi K2, etc.) that don't properly support structured outputs. The LLM may return the JSON schema definition instead of actual data.\n\n### Recommended Approach: Define Custom Entity Types\n\nInstead of working with `ExtractedEntities` directly, **define custom entity types using Pydantic models**:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import Optional\n\n# Define your custom entity types\nclass Person(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"A person entity with biographical information.\"\"\"\n    age: Optional[int] = Field(None, description=\"Age of the person\")\n    occupation: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"Current occupation\")\n    location: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"Current location\")\n\nclass Company(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"A business organization.\"\"\"\n    industry: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"Primary industry\")\n    headquarters: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"Location of headquarters\")\n\n# Create entity type mapping\nentity_types = {\n    \"Person\": Person,\n    \"Company\": Company,\n}\n\n# Use with add_episode()\nawait graphiti.add_episode(\n    name=\"Business Update\",\n    episode_body=\"Sarah joined TechCorp as CTO in January 2023.\",\n    source_description=\"Business news\",\n    reference_time=datetime.now(),\n    entity_types=entity_types,  # Pass your custom types here\n)\n```\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Use LLMs with Structured Output support**: OpenAI and Gemini work best. Other providers may cause validation errors.\n\n2. **Define clear Pydantic models** with detailed descriptions in docstrings and Field descriptions.\n\n3. **Make attributes Optional** to handle cases where information isn't available.\n\n4. **Avoid protected attribute names**: `uuid`, `name`, `group_id`, `labels`, `created_at`, `summary`, `attributes`, `name_embedding`\n\n5. **Use edge type mappings** for richer relationships:\n```python\nedge_type_map = {\n    (\"Person\", \"Company\"): [\"Employment\"],\n    (\"Company\", \"Company\"): [\"Partnership\"],\n}\n```\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nYou shouldn't use `ExtractedEntities` directly—instead, leverage Graphiti's **Custom Entity Types** feature by defining your own Pydantic models and passing them to `add_episode()`. This gives you full control over your domain-specific knowledge graph schema while Graphiti handles the extraction internally.","hint":"A correct answer should explain what the `ExtractedEntities` `response_model` is in Graphiti (a Pydantic model representing the structured entity-extraction output) and show, at least briefly, how to call an LLM or Graphiti API with that response model and handle/validate the returned `extracted_entities` field (including correct field names/types like entity name, type ID, and attributes, and awareness that models must emit schema-compliant JSON to avoid validation errors).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HD7vEUu8iXPqfVQ9rHRFXx","status":"completed","timestamp":126841},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information about the ExtractedEntities response_model:","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RcFdLZSSEhtvaTSgKTMYDG","status":"completed","timestamp":126841},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for more specific information about the ExtractedEntities response_model structure itself:","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EPdmimiq4PVuXfTLQG6fWr","status":"completed","timestamp":126841},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search the GitHub repository directly for the ExtractedEntities model definition:","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KrwziBjLF23z8AVfsPDbtc","status":"completed","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01416kYU6ZdLUndoYzoGxeWF","status":"completed","timestamp":126841},{"type":"message","content":"Let me try to get the raw source code file:","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EKBtmE877iHvdiftapv734","status":"completed","timestamp":126841},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015iq3C2pbaFvLzjX84XQoDq","status":"completed","timestamp":126841},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about how to use the graphiti `ExtractedEntities` response_model in 2026.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use the Graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` is an **internal Pydantic model** used by Graphiti for entity extraction during episode ingestion.

This is useful for synchronizing visual effects, highlighting words, or triggering events at specific points in the synthesized audio.\n\n### Python Example (Most Common)\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud.texttospeech_v1beta1 import (\n    VoiceSelectionParams,\n    AudioConfig,\n    AudioEncoding,\n    SynthesizeSpeechRequest,\n    SynthesisInput,\n    TextToSpeechClient\n)\n\n# Create the client\nclient = TextToSpeechClient()\n\n# Create SSML input with <mark> tags\nssml_text = \"\"\"<speak>\n    <mark name=\"intro\"/>Welcome to our service.\n    <mark name=\"section1\"/>This is the first section.\n    <mark name=\"section2\"/>This is the second section.\n</speak>\"\"\"\n\nsynthesis_input = SynthesisInput(ssml=ssml_text)\n\n# Configure voice\nvoice = VoiceSelectionParams(\n    language_code='en-US',\n    name='en-US-Wavenet-D',\n    ssml_gender='MALE'\n)\n\n# Configure audio output\naudio_config = AudioConfig(audio_encoding=AudioEncoding.MP3)\n\n# Create the request with enable_time_pointing\nrequest = SynthesizeSpeechRequest(\n    input=synthesis_input,\n    voice=voice,\n    audio_config=audio_config,\n    enable_time_pointing=[SynthesizeSpeechRequest.TimepointType.SSML_MARK]\n)\n\n# Make the request\nresponse = client.synthesize_speech(request=request)\n\n# Access the timepoints\nfor timepoint in response.timepoints:\n    print(f\"Mark: {timepoint.mark_name}, Time: {timepoint.time_seconds}s\")\n\n# Save the audio\nwith open(\"output.mp3\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(response.audio_content)\n```\n\n### REST API Example\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"input\": {\n      \"ssml\": \"<speak><mark name=\\\"word1\\\"/>Hello <mark name=\\\"word2\\\"/>world</speak>\"\n    },\n    \"voice\": {\n      \"languageCode\": \"en-US\",\n      \"name\": \"en-US-Wavenet-D\"\n    },\n    \"audioConfig\": {\n      \"audioEncoding\": \"MP3\"\n    },\n    \"enableTimePointing\": [\"SSML_MARK\"]\n  }'\n```\n\n### .NET/C# Example\n\n```csharp\nTextToSpeechClient client = TextToSpeechClient.Create();\n\nSynthesizeSpeechRequest request = new SynthesizeSpeechRequest\n{\n    Input = new SynthesisInput { Ssml = \"<speak><mark name=\\\"1st\\\"/>Hello <mark name=\\\"2nd\\\"/>world</speak>\" },\n    Voice = new VoiceSelectionParams { LanguageCode = \"en-US\", Name = \"en-US-Wavenet-D\" },\n    AudioConfig = new AudioConfig { AudioEncoding = AudioEncoding.Mp3 },\n    EnableTimePointing = { SynthesizeSpeechRequest.Types.TimepointType.SsmlMark }\n};\n\nSynthesizeSpeechResponse response = client.SynthesizeSpeech(request);\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Use v1beta1 API**: This feature is only available in the v1beta1 version, not the stable v1 API.\n\n2. **SSML Required**: You must use SSML input (not plain text) with `<mark>` tags to get timepoint information.\n\n3. **Response Format**: The response includes a `timepoints` array with objects containing:\n   - `mark_name`: The name attribute from your `<mark>` tag\n   - `time_seconds`: The timestamp in seconds when that mark occurs in the audio\n\n4. **Installation** (Python):\n   ```bash\n   pip install google-cloud-texttospeech\n   ```\n\n5. **Important**: Always create a `SynthesizeSpeechRequest` object rather than passing parameters directly to `synthesize_speech()`.","hint":"A good answer must explain that in Google Cloud Text-to-Speech v1beta1 you enable timepointing by setting the `enable_time_pointing` (or `enableTimePointing` in REST) field of `SynthesizeSpeechRequest` to `[TimepointType.SSML_MARK]` and using SSML `<mark>` tags in the input, then reading the returned `timepoints` array (with `markName` and `timeSeconds`) from the response.

Let me provide a comprehensive answer on how to integrate YiPay with One-API and New-API in 2026.\n\n## How to Integrate YiPay (易支付) with One-API and New-API in 2026\n\nBased on current documentation and community resources, here's a comprehensive guide:\n\n---\n\n### What is YiPay (易支付)?\n\n**EPay/YiPay/EasyPay** is a generic term for a \"third-party aggregated payment gateway\" pattern in China. It:\n- Aggregates payment channels like **WeChat Pay**, **Alipay**, and **QQ Wallet**\n- Provides unified order creation, signature verification, and callback interfaces\n- Commonly uses `out_trade_no`, `amount`, `subject`, `notify_url`, `return_url` fields\n- Signs with merchant `PID/KEY` (usually MD5/HMAC/RSA)\n\n---\n\n### Integrating YiPay with New-API\n\n**New-API** (based on One-API) natively supports EPay payment integration.\n\n#### Required Configuration Parameters:\n| Parameter | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **API Base URL** | Your YiPay provider's payment API endpoint (e.g., `https://pay.example.com/submit.php`) |\n| **Merchant ID (PID)** | Your merchant ID from the YiPay platform |\n| **Merchant Key (KEY)** | Your secret key for signing requests |\n\n#### Configuration Steps:\n\n1. **Login to New-API Admin Panel** → Go to **System Settings** → **Payment Settings**\n\n2. **Fill in EPay credentials:**\n   - **EPay API Base URL**: e.g., `https://pay.yourprovider.com`\n   - **Merchant ID (PID)**: Your YiPay merchant ID\n   - **Merchant Key (KEY)**: Your secret key\n\n3. **Configure Recharge Methods** (JSON format):\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n4. **Set Recharge Amount Options** (optional):\n```json\n[10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500]\n```\n\n5. **Save and Enable** – recharge functionality will appear on the Wallet page\n\n---\n\n### Integrating YiPay with One-API (Original)\n\nThe original **One-API** by songquanpeng also supports EPay integration via similar configuration in the admin panel settings.\n\n#### Configuration via Environment Variables (for custom implementations):\n```bash\n# EPay Configuration\nEPAY_API_ADDRESS=https://pay.yourprovider.com/submit.php\nEPAY_PID=your_merchant_id\nEPAY_KEY=your_secret_key\n```\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes for 2026\n\n1. **Callback URL Configuration**: Ensure your YiPay platform has the correct callback (notify_url) pointing to your API endpoint:\n   - New-API: `https://yourdomain.com/api/user/epay/notify`\n   - The system will verify signatures and credit balances automatically\n\n2. **Common Issue – Balance Shows 0**: If users see balance as 0 after payment:\n   - Verify callback URL is accessible from the internet\n   - Check that PID/KEY match exactly\n   - Ensure callback URL doesn't have trailing slashes issues\n   - Confirm the payment type (`alipay`/`wxpay`) matches your YiPay channel configuration\n\n3. **Alternative: KitfoxPay Gateway** (2026): For more payment options, consider using **KitfoxPay**, an adapter gateway that lets New-API connect to **Jeepay** without code modifications, supporting more payment channels.\n\n4. **Compliance**: YiPay is not a licensed payment institution itself – settlement relies on connected licensed channels. Ensure compliance with local regulations.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Register an account with a YiPay provider\n- [ ] Obtain Merchant ID (PID) and Secret Key\n- [ ] Configure API endpoint, PID, and KEY in One-API/New-API admin panel\n- [ ] Set up payment methods (alipay/wxpay)\n- [ ] Configure callback URL in YiPay platform\n- [ ] Test with a small payment\n- [ ] Verify balance updates correctly after payment","hint":"A good answer must recognize YiPay as a payment service/provider and outline a plausible integration approach with generic “one-api”/“new-api”-style gateways, including obtaining API credentials, configuring endpoints, handling callbacks/webhooks, and addressing security (e.g., signatures, HTTPS) and versioning, while acknowledging the likely lack of specific 2026 official documentation and suggesting using the latest YiPay/gateway docs or SDKs instead.[[1]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CAqCAbAbiMMQwN14PLRqo8","status":"completed","timestamp":113478},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search with more specific Chinese-related terms since YiPay (易支付) is a Chinese payment system often used with one-api and new-api (AI API management platforms):","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VSbcYrPqt7qQtLbZ4qnaHR","status":"completed","timestamp":113478},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for more specific configuration details:","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01UnCiA6g4aYkodgFzoMdax4","status":"completed","timestamp":113478},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch more detailed content from the New API documentation page:","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011Rw8C67sE6tonSm4X2yXFd","status":"completed","timestamp":113478},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for more specific One-API payment configuration and also check if there are Chinese documentation pages:","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Xpm5U1kYDguzL8Hvv7jurN","status":"completed","timestamp":113478},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the New API Chinese documentation for payment settings and one-api's more detailed documentation:","timestamp":113478},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VK1TENbSu12b4L6GbmCSNK","status":"completed","timestamp":113478},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have gathered enough information.

Let me provide you with a complete answer.\n\n## Using Rust libp2p Relay Client Behaviour to Dial Through Relays\n\nIn the current rust-libp2p (v0.56.0 / libp2p-relay v0.21.0), here's how to use the relay client behaviour to dial through relays:\n\n### 1. Setup with SwarmBuilder (Recommended Modern Approach)\n\nThe easiest way is using `SwarmBuilder` with `.with_relay_client()`:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    core::multiaddr::{Multiaddr, Protocol},\n    dcutr, identify, identity, noise, ping, relay,\n    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, SwarmEvent},\n    tcp, yamux, PeerId,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct Behaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    ping: ping::Behaviour,\n    identify: identify::Behaviour,\n    dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour,  // Optional: for direct connection upgrade\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let mut swarm = libp2p::SwarmBuilder::with_new_identity()\n        .with_tokio()\n        .with_tcp(\n            tcp::Config::default().nodelay(true),\n            noise::Config::new,\n            yamux::Config::default,\n        )?\n        .with_quic()\n        .with_dns()?\n        .with_relay_client(noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)?\n        .with_behaviour(|keypair, relay_behaviour| Behaviour {\n            relay_client: relay_behaviour,\n            ping: ping::Behaviour::new(ping::Config::new()),\n            identify: identify::Behaviour::new(identify::Config::new(\n                \"/my-app/0.0.1\".to_string(),\n                keypair.public(),\n            )),\n            dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour::new(keypair.public().to_peer_id()),\n        })?\n        .build();\n    \n    // ... rest of your code\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Dialing Through a Relay\n\nTo dial a peer through a relay, construct a `/p2p-circuit` multiaddress:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse()?;  // Relay's peer ID\nlet destination_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse()?;  // Target peer ID\n\n// First, connect to the relay directly\nlet relay_address: Multiaddr = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001\".parse()?;\nswarm.dial(relay_address.clone().with(Protocol::P2p(relay_peer_id)))?;\n\n// Then dial the destination through the relay using /p2p-circuit\nlet dst_addr_via_relay = relay_address\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_peer_id))\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)  // Signal to connect via relay\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_peer_id));\n\nswarm.dial(dst_addr_via_relay)?;\n```\n\n### 3. Listening for Incoming Relayed Connections\n\nTo accept incoming connections through a relay:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_address: Multiaddr = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...\".parse()?;\n\n// Listen on the relay (makes a reservation)\nswarm.listen_on(relay_address.with(Protocol::P2pCircuit))?;\n```\n\n### 4. Alternative: Manual Transport Setup\n\nIf you need more control, use `relay::client::new()` directly:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay,\n    core::transport::OrTransport,\n    tcp::tokio::Transport as TcpTransport,\n    PeerId,\n};\n\nlet local_peer_id = PeerId::random();\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n\n// Combine with your actual transport\nlet transport = OrTransport::new(relay_transport, TcpTransport::default());\n```\n\n### 5. Handling Relay Events\n\nHandle relay client events in your event loop:\n\n```rust\nloop {\n    match swarm.next().await.unwrap() {\n        SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::RelayClient(\n            relay::client::Event::ReservationReqAccepted { .. },\n        )) => {\n            println!(\"Relay accepted our reservation request\");\n        }\n        SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::RelayClient(event)) => {\n            println!(\"Relay event: {:?}\", event);\n        }\n        SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished { peer_id, endpoint, .. } => {\n            println!(\"Connected to {} via {:?}\", peer_id, endpoint);\n        }\n        _ => {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points for 2026\n\n1. **Use `SwarmBuilder`**: The modern API uses `.with_relay_client()` which automatically sets up the transport and behaviour\n2. **Multiaddr format**: Use `/p2p-circuit` protocol in the address to signal relay routing\n3. **DCUtR**: Consider combining with `dcutr::Behaviour` for hole punching to upgrade to direct connections\n4. **Version**: Current stable is `libp2p v0.56.0` with `libp2p-relay v0.21.0`","hint":"A correct answer must describe how to use the current (latest) Rust libp2p relay client components—specifically the `libp2p::relay::client` behaviour and its associated client transport/connection types—to dial a remote peer via a relay, including constructing a `Swarm` with the relay client behaviour, wrapping the base `Transport` with the relay client transport, and dialing a peer using a relayed multiaddr (e.g., including the relay and `/p2p-circuit` segments) rather than a direct address.

In v1.2+, you need to explicitly configure the transport type:\n\n**Before (v1.1 and earlier):**\n```python\nfrom livekit.agents.llm import mcp\n\nmcp_server = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(url=\"https://your-mcp-server.com/sse\")\n```\n\n**After (v1.2+):**\n```python\nfrom livekit.agents.llm import mcp\n\n# Option 1: Explicit transport type (recommended)\nmcp_server = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://your-mcp-server.com/endpoint\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\"  # or \"sse\" for legacy servers\n)\n\n# Option 2: Auto-detection based on URL path\n# URLs ending with '/mcp' → streamable HTTP\n# URLs ending with '/sse' → SSE transport\nmcp_server = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(url=\"https://your-mcp-server.com/mcp\")\n```\n\n### 2. **New `allowed_tools` Parameter**\n\nv1.2+ introduces tool filtering capability:\n\n```python\nmcp_server = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://your-mcp-server.com/mcp\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\",\n    allowed_tools=[\"tool1\", \"tool2\"]  # Only expose specific tools\n)\n```\n\n### 3. **Agent Response Issue After MCP Tool Execution (v1.2.7 Regression)**\n\nIf your agent stops responding after MCP tool execution, this was a known regression in v1.2.7 (fixed in later versions). **Fix:** Upgrade to v1.2.8+ or v1.3.x:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade livekit-agents[mcp]>=1.3.0\n```\n\n### 4. **MCP Server Initialization Changes**\n\nEnsure MCP servers are properly initialized before use:\n\n```python\nfrom livekit.agents import Agent\nfrom livekit.agents.llm import mcp\n\n# Create MCP server\nmcp_server = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://your-mcp-server.com/mcp\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\",\n    client_session_timeout_seconds=5\n)\n\n# Pass to Agent\nagent = Agent(\n    instructions=\"Your instructions here\",\n    mcp_servers=[mcp_server]  # Pass as a list\n)\n```\n\n### 5. **Error Handling Changes**\n\nMCP error messages now use the `text` attribute instead of `str(part)`:\n\n```python\n# The framework now handles errors better internally\n# If implementing custom MCP handling, use:\nerror_str = \"\\n\".join(\n    part.text if hasattr(part, \"text\") else str(part)\n    for part in tool_result.content\n)\n```\n\n### Key Migration Steps Summary:\n\n1. **Update dependencies:** `pip install --upgrade livekit-agents[mcp]>=1.3.0`\n2. **Explicitly set transport_type** to avoid auto-detection issues\n3. **Update MCP server URLs** to end with `/mcp` for streamable HTTP or `/sse` for legacy SSE\n4. **Use `mcp_servers` parameter** when creating Agents (as a list)\n5. **Handle empty tool lists** - empty lists are now treated as `None`\n\n### References:\n- LiveKit MCP API docs: https://docs.livekit.io/reference/python/v1/livekit/agents/llm/mcp.html\n- Migration guide from v0.x to v1.x: https://docs.livekit.io/reference/migration-guides/v0-migration/python/","hint":"A correct answer should identify that LiveKit Agents v1.2 introduced breaking changes to the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and must describe (a) what changed in the MCP client/server configuration or tool registration (e.g., how MCP servers are wired into `Agent` / `AgentSession`, changes to `function_tool` usage, `tools`/`update_tools()` behavior, or connection parameters) and (b) concrete migration steps or code adjustments (before/after or upgrade instructions) needed to restore a working MCP-based tools setup in 2025-era projects.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025?","timestamp":53670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":53670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01TCXRFDaTp6Yz4o4cqjLn3N","status":"completed","timestamp":53670},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about v1.2 breaking changes and migration:","timestamp":53670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PBMW9XJ3abEqyBr9bDnTvr","status":"completed","timestamp":53670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RrUYBxjPkwXgpWsBqy87jL","status":"completed","timestamp":53670},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information about the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP changes:","timestamp":53670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":53670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WYtQM4q1w9HwSn4zds5xr6","status":"completed","timestamp":53670},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for more specific information about v1.2 breaking changes:","timestamp":53670},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BmskpXsgZVFMC1z5SFuHRc","status":"completed","timestamp":53670},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, let me provide you with a comprehensive answer about fixing breaking changes in LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025.\n\n## How to Fix Breaking Changes in LiveKit Agents v1.2 MCP Implementation\n\nBased on my research, here are the key breaking changes and fixes for MCP implementation in LiveKit agents v1.2.x (released in 2025):\n\n### 1. **Transport Type Changes (SSE → Streamable HTTP)**\n\nThe MCP protocol is transitioning from SSE (Server-Sent Events) to streamable HTTP transport.
