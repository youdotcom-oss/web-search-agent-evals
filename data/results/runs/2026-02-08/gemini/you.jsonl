{"id":"websearch-2","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?\nBased on the latest trends and expert opinions for 2026, here\n are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables.\n\n### **Galleries**\n\n####\n **Landing Page Strategies**\n\n*   **Immersive Visuals:** Use high-quality, full-screen images and\n videos as hero elements to immediately capture attention. Looping background videos can create a dynamic and engaging experience.\n*   **\nInteractive Elements:** Incorporate interactive elements like virtual tours, 360-degree views, and \"before and after\" sliders\n to encourage user engagement and exploration.\n*   **Storytelling:** Structure your gallery to tell a story. Group images\n and videos thematically and use captions and short descriptions to provide context and create a narrative.\n*   **Personalization:** Use\n AI and user data to personalize the gallery content for each visitor. Showcasing recently viewed items, related content, or galleries\n based on browsing history can significantly increase engagement.\n*   **Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** Even\n in a visually-driven gallery, CTAs are crucial. Use clear and concise CTAs like \"Explore the Collection,\" \"View\n Details,\" or \"Shop the Look\" to guide users to the next step.\n*   **Social Proof:** Integrate\n user-generated content from social media platforms to build trust and authenticity. Customer photos and videos can be a powerful addition to your gallery\n.\n*   **Minimalist Design:** A clean and simple layout will ensure that your images and videos are the main\n focus. Use ample white space and a simple color palette to avoid distractions.\n\n#### **Responsive Design Patterns**\n\n*   \n**CSS Grid and Flexbox:** These are the cornerstones of modern responsive gallery layouts. Use CSS Grid to create dynamic\n, masonry-style layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, and use Flexbox for aligning items and creating flexible content blocks.\n*\n   **Optimized Images:** Use the `<picture>` element and the `srcset` attribute to serve appropriately sized images for different\n devices and screen resolutions. This is crucial for performance and user experience.\n*   **Touch-Friendly Navigation:** On\n mobile devices, implement intuitive swipe gestures for navigating through galleries. Ensure that navigation buttons are large enough to be easily tapped.\n\n*   **Lazy Loading:** To improve page load speed, implement lazy loading for images and videos. This means that media\n will only load as the user scrolls down the page.\n*   **Consistent Aspect Ratios:** Maintain a consistent aspect ratio for\n your images to prevent layout shifts and create a more visually appealing and professional look.\n*   **Full-Screen Light\nbox:** When a user clicks on an image, display it in a full-screen lightbox with easy-to-use navigation\n controls and a clear exit button.\n*   **AI-Powered Layouts:** Expect to see more AI-driven\n layouts that can analyze the content of your images and automatically create the most effective and visually appealing gallery layout.\n\n### **Pricing Tables\n**\n\n#### **Landing Page Strategies**\n\n*   **Clear and Simple Tiers:** Present your pricing in clear,\n distinct tiers. Use concise and benefit-oriented names for each plan to help users quickly understand the value proposition.\n*   \n**Highlight the Recommended Plan:** Use visual cues like a \"Most Popular\" badge, a different color, or a slightly\n larger size to draw attention to the plan you want most users to choose.\n*   **Interactive Toggles:** Use toggles\n to allow users to switch between monthly and annual pricing. This is a user-friendly way to display different billing options and\n often encourages users to opt for the annual plan.\n*   **Feature Comparison:** Clearly list the features included in each plan.\n Use checkmarks and other visual aids to make it easy for users to compare the different tiers.\n*   **Trust\n Signals:** Include testimonials, customer logos, and security badges near your pricing table to build trust and credibility.\n*   \n**FAQ Section:** Proactively address common questions and concerns in an FAQ section below the pricing table. This can help to\n reduce friction and increase conversions.\n*   **Clear CTAs:** Each pricing tier should have a clear and prominent call-to-\naction button, such as \"Get Started,\" \"Sign Up,\" or \"Buy Now.\"\n\n#### **Responsive Design Patterns\n**\n\n*   **Card-Based Layout:** On desktop devices, a side-by-side card-based layout is the\n most common and effective way to display pricing tiers.\n*   **Vertical Stacking:** On mobile devices, the pricing\n tiers should stack vertically to ensure readability and ease of use. Each tier should be a self-contained card with all the necessary\n information.\n*   **Horizontal Scrolling:** For pricing tables with many features, consider a horizontally scrolling table on mobile devices.\n However, make sure that the most important information is visible without scrolling.\n*   **Sticky Headers:** When the user scrolls down\n to view a long list of features, the header of the pricing table with the plan names and prices should remain \"sticky\" at the\n top of the screen.\n*   **Accordion/Collapsible Sections:** To avoid overwhelming users with information, consider using accord\nions or collapsible sections to show and hide the feature lists for each plan.\n*   **Prioritize Key Information:** On smaller\n screens, prioritize the most important information, such as the plan name, price, and CTA. Less critical information can be\n hidden or moved to a secondary view.\n*   **Test on Real Devices:** Always test your pricing tables on a\n variety of real devices to ensure that they are easy to read, navigate, and use.","hint":"A correct answer must describe current (2026) high-converting landing page principles (clear value proposition and CTA, scannable layouts, social proof, mobile-first performance and responsiveness) and apply them specifically to galleries and pricing tables by mentioning modern responsive patterns (e.g., card- or grid-based galleries, carousels, masonry or modular layouts; stacked, accordion, or comparison-table pricing that reflows on small screens), along with UX details like visual hierarchy, clarity, and accessibility considerations for different devices.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","timestamp":43386},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":43386},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770544532405-d84a18a489c748","status":"completed","timestamp":43386},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770544537875-2c13bb5a6bad5","status":"completed","timestamp":43386},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770544544735-0b76adfe5ee848","status":"completed","timestamp":43386},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770544551049-b9a6373d86645","status":"completed","timestamp":43386},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest trends and expert opinions for 2026, here","timestamp":43386},{"type":"message","content":" are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables.\n\n### **Galleries**\n\n####","timestamp":43386},{"type":"message","content":" **Landing Page Strategies**\n\n*   **Immersive Visuals:** Use high-quality, full-screen images and","timestamp":43386},{"type":"message","content":" videos as hero elements to immediately capture attention.

{"id":"websearch-49","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026\nAs of early 2026, deploying a GPT model to Azure\n AI Foundry can be done using several methods, including the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools\n like Pulumi. While the Azure documentation and community examples often highlight the Azure CLI and Portal, you can definitely use Pulumi to\n achieve the same goal in a more automated and repeatable way.\n\nHere's how you can think about it and what\n a Pulumi program might look like.\n\n### **Understanding the Deployment Process**\n\nBased on the latest information from late\n 2025 and early 2026, Azure AI Foundry has expanded to include a wide range of models,\n including the `GPT-5` series. The deployment process generally involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Create an Azure AI Hub\n Resource:** This is the top-level resource that contains your AI projects.\n2.  **Create an Azure AI Project:** This\n resource acts as a container for your AI assets, including models, deployments, and endpoints.\n3.  **Deploy\n a Model:** Within your AI project, you can deploy a model from the catalog. This creates an endpoint that you can use for\n inference.\n\n### **Deploying with Pulumi**\n\nPulumi's `azure-native` provider gives you access\n to all the resources available in the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API. This means that if you can do it with the Azure\n CLI or an ARM template, you can do it with Pulumi.\n\nHere is a conceptual example in TypeScript of how you might deploy\n a `gpt-5` model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi.\n\n*Please note that the specific resource names and properties might\n evolve. Always refer to the official Pulumi Azure Native provider documentation for the most up-to-date information.*\n\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\n\";\n\n// 1. Set up your basic configuration\nconst config = new pulumi.Config();\nconst location = config.get\n(\"location\") || \"eastus\";\nconst resourceGroupName = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"my\n-ai-foundry-rg\", {\n    location,\n}).name;\n\n// 2. Create an Azure AI Hub\n Resource\nconst hub = new azure_native.machinelearningservices.Hub(\"my-ai-hub\", {\n    \nhubName: \"my-ai-hub\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroupName,\n    location: location,\n    sku\n: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n    },\n});\n\n// 3. Create an Azure AI Project\n within the Hub\nconst project = new azure_native.machinelearningservices.Project(\"my-ai-project\", {\n\n    projectName: \"my-gpt5-project\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroupName,\n    location: location\n,\n    hubId: hub.id,\n    description: \"A project to deploy GPT-5 with Pulumi\",\n\n});\n\n// 4. Deploy the GPT-5 model\nconst modelDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment\n(\"my-gpt5-deployment\", {\n    // NOTE: The resource structure might differ slightly.\n    // This\n is based on the `az cognitiveservices account deployment create` command.\n    accountName: project.name, //\n This assumes the project name can be used as the account name.\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroupName,\n    deploymentName:\n \"gpt5-endpoint\",\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            name: \"gpt-5\n\", // Or a specific version like \"gpt-5.2\"\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            \nversion: \"2026-01-01\", // Use the appropriate version\n        },\n    \n},\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 1,\n    },\n});\n\n\n// 5. Export the endpoint URL for easy access\nexport const endpoint = pulumi.interpolate`https://${project\n.name}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/deployments/${modelDeployment.name}/chat/completions\n?api-version=2024-02-01`;\n\n\n```\n\n\n### **Key Considerations for\n 2026**\n\n*   **Model Versions:** Azure AI Foundry is rapidly evolving. Be sure to check\n the model catalog in the Azure Portal to get the correct name and version of the model you want to deploy (e.g.,\n `gpt-5`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-oss-120b`).\n*   \n**New Features:** Azure AI Foundry has introduced features like the \"model router\" for cost-effective inferencing and the \"\nFoundry Agent Service\" for building powerful AI agents.

{"id":"websearch-88","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?\nIn \n2026, handling memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph revolves around its core architecture as a state machine\n. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and practices:\n\n### 1. State Management: The Core of LangGraph Memory\n\n\nLangGraph's approach to memory is centered on the concept of a **state object** that is passed between the\n nodes of your graph. Each node can read from, and write to, this state object.\n\n*   **Stateful\n Graphs:** You define a `StateGraph` with a specific state schema (e.g., a Pydantic model\n or a TypedDict). This schema defines the structure of your memory for the duration of a task.\n*   **Nodes\n and State Updates:** Each node in your graph is a function or runnable that receives the current state as input and returns a\n dictionary of updates to be applied to the state.\n*   **Checkpointers for Persistence:** To make memory persistent between\n runs, LangGraph uses \"checkpointers.\" These save the state of the graph after each step. This is how you achieve\n short-term memory (for a single conversation) and can be extended for long-term memory. Common checkpointers include \n`MemorySaver` (for in-memory storage) and database-backed options like `SqliteSaver` or integrations with MongoDB\n and AWS AgentCore Memory for more robust, long-term storage.\n\n### 2. Short-Term vs. Long-\nTerm Memory\n\nLangGraph makes a distinction between two types of memory:\n\n*   **Short-Term Memory (Thread-Scoped\n):** This is the memory of the current conversation or session. It's managed by the state object within a specific\n \"thread\" of execution and is handled by the checkpointers mentioned above.\n*   **Long-Term Memory (\nCross-Thread):** This is for storing information across multiple conversations or sessions (e.g., user preferences). This\n is where \"stores\" come into play. You can use a store (like a vector store or a key-value store)\n to save and retrieve information that can be accessed by any thread. The agent can be given a tool to explicitly search this\n long-term memory.\n\n### 3. RAG Context Injection as an Agentic Tool\n\nIn LangGraph,\n RAG is not just a simple pre-processing step. It's treated as a tool that the agent can dynamically\n decide to use. This is a more advanced, \"agentic\" approach to RAG.\n\n*   **R\nAG as a Tool:** You create a retriever (e.g., from a vector store) and wrap it in a \n`Tool`. This tool can then be called by the agent just like any other tool (e.g., a calculator or a search engine\n).\n*   **Agentic Decision-Making:** The core of the agent is an LLM that, at each step\n, decides what to do next. Based on the user's query and the current state, the LLM can choose to:\n\n    1.  Respond to the user directly.\n    2.  Call the RAG tool to retrieve relevant\n context.\n    3.

Replace `<version>` with the desired Dagger version (e.g.,\n `v0.11.9`).\n\n    \n```bash\n    VERSION=\"<version>\"\n    OS=\"$(\nuname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')\"\n    ARCH=\"$(uname -m)\"\n    if [\n \"$ARCH\" = \"x86_64\" ]; then ARCH=\"amd64\"; fi\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Download the release artifact:**\n    Use `curl` to download the release tarball for your\n specified version, OS, and architecture from the Dagger GitHub repository.\n\n    \n```bash\n    curl -L \"\nhttps://github.com/dagger/container-use/releases/download/${VERSION}/container-use_${VERSION}_${\nOS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz\" -o \"dagger-container-use.tar.gz\"\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Extract and install the binary:**\n    Extract the downloaded tarball and move the `container-use\n` binary to a directory in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.\n\n    \n```bash\n    tar -\nxzf dagger-container-use.tar.gz\n    sudo mv container-use /usr/local/bin\n/\n    \n```\n\n\n4.  **Verify the installation:**\n    Check that the installed version is the one you specified\n.\n\n    \n```bash\n    container-use version\n    ```\n\n\n### Method 2: Directly Using a Versioned Dagger\n Engine Container\n\nFor purely container-based workflows, you can directly use a specific version of the Dagger Engine container image.

If you are using Dagger SDKs (e.g., in Go, Python,\n or TypeScript), you can typically configure the Dagger client to connect to a specific engine version.\n\n    For example, when\n using the Go SDK, you can specify the engine version in your code:\n\n    \n```go\n    client, err := dagger\n.Connect(ctx, dagger.WithRunnerHost(\"docker-container://<container_name_or_id>\n\"))\n    \n```\n\n\n    You would first start the Dagger engine container with a specific version:\n\n    \n```bash\n    docker\n run --rm -d --name dagger-engine --privileged registry.dagger.io/engine:<version>\n    \n```\n\n\n    Then your application, configured to connect to this container, will use the specified version of the Dagger Engine.\n\n\n**Note on Future Changes:**\n\nGiven that your query is for the year 2026, it is highly\n recommended to consult the official Dagger documentation for the most current and accurate installation methods.

Here's how\n you can address this issue in 2024, with a few different approaches:\n\n### Recommended Solution: Modify U\nFW's `after.rules`\n\nThis is the most common and robust solution, as it allows you to continue\n managing your firewall with UFW without disabling Docker's networking features.\n\n1.  **Edit `/etc/uf\nw/after.rules`:**\n\n    Open this file with a text editor with `sudo` privileges:\n\n    \n```bash\n\n    sudo nano /etc/ufw/after.rules\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Add the following\n rules:**\n\n    Add the following lines to the *end* of the file. These rules essentially tell UFW to deny\n all forwarded traffic by default, and then specifically allow traffic from the Docker bridge (`docker0`) if it's related\n to an existing connection.\n\n    \n```\n    # BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n    *nat\n    :\nPOSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n    -A POSTROUTING ! -o docker0 -s \n172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE\n    COMMIT\n\n    *filter\n\n    :DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n    -A FORWARD -j DOCKER-USER\n\n    -A DOCKER-USER -i docker0 -o docker0 -j ACCEPT\n    -A\n DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n    # END UFW AND DOCKER\n    \n```\n\n\n3.\n  **Reload UFW:**\n\n    \n```bash\n    sudo ufw reload\n    ```\n\n\n### Alternative Solution:\n The `ufw-docker` Script\n\nThere is a popular community script that automates the process of managing UFW rules for\n Docker.\n\n1.  **Download the script:**\n\n    \n```bash\n    sudo wget -O /usr/local\n/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master\n/ufw-docker\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Make it executable:**\n\n    \n```bash\n    sudo\n chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Install the\n rules:**\n\n    \n```bash\n    ufw-docker install\n    ```\n\n\nThis script will automatically add the necessary rules to\n your UFW configuration.\n\n### Alternative Solution 2: Bind Container Ports to Localhost\n\nIf your containers only need to be accessed\n from the host machine itself (and not from the external network), you can bind the container's ports to the localhost\n IP address (`127.0.0.1`).\n\nWhen you run a container, instead of using the\n `-p` flag like this:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8080:80 nginx\n\n\n```\n\n\nBind it to localhost:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:\n8080:80 nginx\n\n```\n\n\nThis way, the container's port 80 will only be accessible from\n the host machine on port 8080, and UFW will not be bypassed.\n\n### Not Recommended: Dis\nabling Docker's `iptables` Management\n\nYou can configure Docker to stop manipulating `iptables` altogether by editing\n `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and adding:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"iptables\": false\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**However, this is not recommended** as it can break container networking, including the ability for containers to connect to\n the internet.","hint":"Look for an explanation that Docker modifies iptables/NAT so published container ports bypass UFW’s INPUT/FORWARD chains, and concrete 2024-compatible fixes such as adding rules in the DOCKER-USER chain or /etc/ufw/after.rules (or using tools like ufw-docker) so UFW filters container traffic, plus safe practices like binding ports to 127.0.0.1 or using internal Docker networks instead of public -p mappings for internal-only services.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?","timestamp":22911},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":22911},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770545050015-750488006c278","status":"completed","timestamp":22911},{"type":"message","content":"Docker's default behavior of directly","timestamp":22911},{"type":"message","content":" manipulating `iptables` can cause it to bypass UFW firewall rules, creating a potential security risk.

Here are the key differences:\n\n\n### 1. Support Lifecycle\n\n*   **.NET Framework 4.5.2:** This version is **out of\n support**. Microsoft ended support for .NET 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6\n.1 on April 26, 2022.

Its lifecycle is tied to the operating system it'\ns installed on. It will continue to receive security updates as long as the underlying Windows version is supported.\n\n### 2.\n Technical Improvements in .NET 4.8\n\n.NET Framework 4.8 introduced several improvements and new features that\n are not present in 4.5.2:\n\n*   **Runtime and BCL (Base Class Library) Enh\nancements:**\n    *   **Improved ZLib:** The clrcompression.dll now uses an updated version of the\n ZLib library for better performance and security in data compression.\n    *   **Cryptographic Improvements:** Managed cryptography classes\n are more robust and less likely to throw a `CryptographicException` when the system is in FIPS mode.\n\n    *   **Antimalware Scanning:** For applications running on Windows 10, the runtime can now trigger scans\n by antimalware solutions for assemblies loaded from byte arrays, enhancing security.\n*   **WCF (Windows Communication\n Foundation) and WFF (Windows Workflow Foundation) Enhancements:** .NET 4.8 includes accessibility improvements and some\n service behavior enhancements.\n*   **High DPI and UI Improvements:** There are numerous high-DPI rendering improvements in\n Windows Forms and WPF, which are crucial for modern displays.\n\n### 3. C# Language Version\n\n*   **.NET Framework\n 4.5.2:** Supports up to **C# 5.0**.\n*   **.NET Framework \n4.8:** Is limited to **C# 7.3**.\n\nThis is a significant difference.

All new development and innovation from Microsoft are\n focused on the modern .NET, which will be at a much higher version number by then (e.g., .NET \n9 or 10).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nFor any application still on .NET Framework 4.5.\n2 in 2025, upgrading is a high priority.

Here\n's a breakdown of what it means and how to fix it:\n\n### What the error means\n\nThe error `CannotBridgeTo\nSameNetwork` indicates that you are trying to execute a bridge transaction where the source network and the destination network are the same.\n In the context of a cross-chain bridge like LI.FI, this is not a valid operation. The purpose of a bridge\n is to move assets from one blockchain network to another (e.g., from Ethereum to Polygon).\n\n### How to fix it\n\n\nTo fix this error, you need to ensure that the destination network you specify in your transaction is different from the source network. For\n example, if you are initiating a transaction from the Ethereum network, the destination network must be a different network, such as Polygon,\n Arbitrum, or any other network supported by LI.FI.\n\nWhen interacting with the LI.FI protocol, whether\n through their API or directly with their smart contracts, double-check the parameters you are passing for the destination chain ID. It\n must not be the same as the source chain ID.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n*   **LI.FI Error Codes**:\n For more information on specific LI.FI error codes, you can refer to their official documentation: [https://docs.li.fi\n/api-reference/error-codes](https://docs.li.fi/api-reference/error-codes)\n*\n   **Solidity Custom Errors**: To learn more about custom errors in Solidity, you can read the official Solidity documentation: [\nhttps://www.soliditylang.org/blog/2021/04/21/custom-errors/\n](https://www.soliditylang.org/blog/2021/04/21/\ncustom-errors/)","hint":"A good answer must recognize that `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` is a Solidity custom error in LiFi’s bridge facets that triggers when the source and destination chains/networks are the same (e.g., identical chain IDs), and explain that the fix is to ensure different source/destination network parameters (or correct misconfigured chain IDs) before invoking the bridge, possibly mentioning updating or checking the contract/config that validates these values.[[1]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix the lifi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error in solidity 2026","timestamp":18237},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":18237},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770545320008-9d801cda6c816","status":"completed","timestamp":18237},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results","timestamp":18237},{"type":"message","content":", the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error is a custom error in Solidity, likely from the LI.FI smart contracts.

{"id":"websearch-557","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?\nHere\n are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides, with a forward-looking perspective for\n 2026.\n\n### 1. Use `NULL` as a Default Value in Your PostgreSQL Function\n\nThe\n most robust and standard way to handle optional parameters in PostgreSQL is to assign them a default value of `NULL`. This allows\n you to call the RPC from your client without providing the parameter if you don't need it.\n\nHere is an example of a\n PL/pgSQL function that takes an optional array of pricing overrides. In this case, we'll use `JSONB` for\n flexibility, which is a common and recommended practice.\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE TYPE pricing_override AS (\n  product_\nid UUID,\n  new_price NUMERIC\n);\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n  \noverrides pricing_override[] DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS TABLE (\n  -- your return columns\n) AS $$\nBEGIN\n\n  -- Check if the overrides array is provided and not empty\n  IF overrides IS NOT NULL AND array_length(over\nrides, 1) > 0 THEN\n    -- Loop through the overrides and apply them\n    FOR i IN 1..\narray_length(overrides, 1) LOOP\n      -- Example: Update a temporary table or perform some other\n logic\n      UPDATE products\n      SET price = (overrides[i]).new_price\n      WHERE id = (overrides\n[i]).product_id;\n    END LOOP;\n  END IF;\n\n  -- Return the modified data\n\n  RETURN QUERY SELECT ... FROM ...;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Client-\nSide Implementation (JavaScript)\n\nWhen calling the RPC from your JavaScript client, you can now omit the `overrides` parameter if you\n don't have any pricing overrides to apply.\n\n**With overrides:**\n\n\n```javascript\nconst { data, error\n } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  overrides: [\n    { product_id\n: '...', new_price: 99.99 },\n    { product_id: '...', new_\nprice: 149.99 },\n  ],\n});\n\n```\n\n\n**Without overrides:**\n\n\n```javascript\n\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides');\n\n```\n\n\n###\n 3. Use `JSONB` for Flexibility\n\nWhile PostgreSQL typed arrays (like `pricing_override[]` in the example\n) offer strong type safety within the database, using a `JSONB` parameter can be more flexible, especially if the\n structure of your overrides might change over time.\n\nHere's how you could adapt the function to use `JSONB`:\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides_json(\n  overrides JSONB DEFAULT NULL\n\n)\n-- ...\n\n```\n\n\nYou would then parse the JSON within the function. This approach is particularly useful if you\n have nested data or a more complex structure for your overrides.\n\n### 4. Leverage Generated Types for Type Safety\n\nA\n key best practice for modern development (and certainly for 2026) is to maintain type safety between your database\n and your client-side code. After defining your RPC function, use the Supabase CLI to generate TypeScript types for your database schema.\n\n\n\n```bash\nnpx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-id> > types/supabase.\nts\n\n```\n\n\nThis will give you type definitions for your RPC functions, which you can use in your application to catch\n errors at compile time and benefit from autocompletion.\n\n### Summary of Best Practices:\n\n*   **Define optional\n parameters with `DEFAULT NULL`** in your PostgreSQL function.\n*   **Check for `NULL` or empty arrays** within\n your function logic.\n*   **Use `JSONB` for more complex or evolving** array item structures.\n*\n   **Omit the parameter in your client-side RPC call** when it's not needed.\n*   \n**Generate and use TypeScript types** for your database to ensure end-to-end type safety.","hint":"A correct answer should explain how to define the underlying PostgreSQL function used by Supabase RPC so that the array parameter is truly optional (e.g., with a default of NULL or an empty array and server-side logic that distinguishes “no overrides” from “apply these overrides”), and how to pass/omit that array from the Supabase client SDK in a type-safe way (e.g., typed array/JSONB, named parameters) without breaking existing calls.[[1]] It should also mention handling edge cases like empty arrays vs missing parameters, ensuring backwards compatibility for existing clients, and validating the override data before applying pricing logic.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","timestamp":26111},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":26111},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770545788027-2777354245b8a","status":"completed","timestamp":26111},{"type":"message","content":"Here","timestamp":26111},{"type":"message","content":" are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides, with a forward-looking perspective for","timestamp":26111},{"type":"message","content":" 2026.\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-560","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use Vercel AI SDK streamText for multimodal content and image support in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use Vercel AI SDK streamText for multimodal content and image support in 2026\nThe Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` function is fully capable of handling multimodal content, including image\n generation, as of 2026. You can leverage this functionality to create dynamic, AI-powered applications that go\n beyond simple text generation.\n\n### Key Concepts for Multimodal Support with `streamText`\n\n1.  **Provider\n-Defined Tools**: For many models, including OpenAI's GPT-5 variants, image generation is exposed as a \"\ntool\" that the `streamText` function can call. The AI SDK abstracts the tool-calling mechanism, so you can\n work with the results in a streamlined manner.\n\n2.  **Streaming Tool Results**: When you use `streamText` with a\n model that has image generation capabilities, the images are streamed back to your application as `tool-result` events. These results\n typically contain the image data in a format like base64-encoded strings.\n\n3.  **Handling Image Data**: Your\n client-side code will need to be set up to handle these `tool-result` events. You can then parse\n the image data and display it in your application's UI.\n\n### Example: Using `streamText` for Image Generation\n\n\nHere's a conceptual example of how you might use `streamText` to generate an image with a fictional \"gpt\n-image-1\" model:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai\n } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { prompt\n } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = await streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-image\n-1'), // Or any other multimodal model\n    prompt: prompt,\n    // The 'tools' parameter might\n be used to specify the image generation tool\n    // depending on the provider and model.\n  });\n\n  //\n The result stream will contain text and tool-result parts.\n  // You'll need to handle the different parts of\n the stream.\n  return result.toAIStreamResponse();\n}\n\n```\n\n\nOn the client-side, you would use\n a hook like `useChat` or a custom implementation to process the stream and render the results:\n\n\n```tsx\n'\nuse client';\n\nimport { useChat } from 'ai/react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const {\n messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {messages\n.map(m => (\n        <div key={m.id}>\n          <strong>{m.role}:</strong>\n\n          {m.content}\n          {/* Look for image data in the message and render it */}\n          {m\n.tool_results?.map((tool_result: any) => {\n            if (tool_result.type\n === 'image') {\n              return <img src={`data:image/png;base64,${tool\n_result.image_data}`} alt=\"Generated Image\" />;\n            }\n            return null;\n          })}\n        \n</div>\n      ))}\n\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n        <input\n          value={input}\n          onChange={\nhandleInputChange}\n          placeholder=\"Describe the image you want to generate...\"\n        />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Generate\n</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Important Considerations for 202\n6\n\n*   **AI SDK v6 and Agents**: With the release of AI SDK v6, Vercel is\n promoting the use of \"agents\" and composable APIs. These are higher-level abstractions that can simplify the process of working\n with multimodal content. While `streamText` remains a powerful, low-level tool, you should also explore the new\n agent-based APIs for a more streamlined development experience.\n*   **Model-Specific Implementations**: The exact implementation\n details for image generation can vary between different AI models and providers. Always refer to the latest documentation for the specific model you are\n using to understand how it integrates with the Vercel AI SDK.\n*   **Error Handling and UI**: Robust\n error handling is crucial. You'll need to handle cases where the model fails to generate an image or returns an error. Additionally\n, consider the user experience and provide feedback to the user while the image is being generated.\n\nBy leveraging the `streamText` function\n and the broader capabilities of the Vercel AI SDK, you can build sophisticated applications that seamlessly integrate text and image generation.","hint":"A good answer must explain how to call `streamText` from the Vercel AI SDK with a multimodal-capable model (e.g., GPT‑4o or Gemini) and messages that include image parts/URLs or attachments, and describe how image results are returned and consumed (e.g., via tool-result events or specific fields in the stream). It should also note any 2025–2026 API patterns or version details relevant to multimodal/image support (such as AI SDK v5/v6, AI Gateway image generation behavior, and handling base64 or tool-result image payloads) rather than only covering basic text streaming.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use Vercel AI SDK streamText for multimodal content and image support in 2026","timestamp":20513},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":20513},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770545831657-f924f20657b848","status":"completed","timestamp":20513},{"type":"message","content":"The Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` function is fully capable of handling multimodal content, including image","timestamp":20513},{"type":"message","content":" generation, as of 2026.

{"id":"websearch-614","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024\nIt can be frustrating when your embedded YouTube videos aren't indexed in Google Search Console. Here are the common reasons and\n how to fix them in 2024:\n\n### 1. Check the Video Indexing Report in Google Search Console\n\n\nFirst, you need to see what Google thinks is wrong.\n\n*   **How to access:** In Google Search Console\n, go to **Video pages** in the left-hand menu.\n*   **What to look for:** This report\n will show you which videos Google has indexed and which it hasn't, along with the reasons why. Common errors include:\n    \n*   \"Video not processed\"\n    *   \"Video not found\"\n    *   \"Video not the\n main content of the page\"\n    *   \"No thumbnail URL provided\"\n\n### 2. Implement Video Schema\n Markup (`VideoObject`)\n\nThis is the most important step to help Google understand your video content. By adding `VideoObject\n` structured data to your page, you're explicitly telling Google about your video's title, description, thumbnail, and duration\n.\n\nHere is a basic example of a `VideoObject` schema in JSON-LD format. You can add this to\n the `<head>` section of your blog post:\n\n\n```json\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \n\"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Your video description.\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https\n://i.ytimg.com/vi/YOUR_VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg\",\n  \"\nuploadDate\": \"2024-01-15T08:00:00+\n08:00\",\n  \"duration\": \"PT1M54S\",\n  \"embedUrl\n\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n</script>\n\n```\n\n\n**To implement this:**\n\n*   Replace the placeholder text with your video's information.\n*   You\n can get the `thumbnailUrl` from `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YOUR_VIDEO_ID\n/maxresdefault.jpg`.\n*   The `duration` is in ISO 8601 format.\n\n*   Use Google's [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results\n) to validate your schema.\n\n### 3. Create a Video Sitemap\n\nA video sitemap is an XML file that tells\n Google about all the videos on your site. This is especially useful if you have a lot of videos.\n\nHere's an example\n of a video sitemap entry:\n\n\n```xml\n<url>\n  <loc>https://www.your\n-blog.com/your-post-with-the-video</loc>\n  <video:video>\n    \n<video:thumbnail_loc>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YOUR_VIDEO_ID/max\nresdefault.jpg</video:thumbnail_loc>\n    <video:title>Your Video Title</video:title>\n\n    <video:description>Your video description.</video:description>\n    <video:player_loc>https://www\n.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID</video:player_loc>\n    <video:\nduration>114</video:duration>\n    <video:publication_date>2024-01-\n15T08:00:00+08:00</video:publication_date>\n\n  </video:video>\n</url>\n\n```\n\n\n**To implement this:**\n\n*   Create a\n new XML file with all your video information.\n*   Submit the sitemap to Google Search Console under **Sitemaps**.\n\n\n### 4. Make Sure the Video Is Prominent\n\nGoogle is more likely to index a video if it's a\n key part of the page's content.\n\n*   **Placement:** The video should be high up on the page and\n clearly visible.\n*   **Surrounding Text:** Include text around the video that is relevant to the video's content\n. A transcript is a great option.\n*   **Avoid Lazy Loading:** If your video only loads after a user\n clicks a button, Google might not see it. Make sure the video is loaded in the initial HTML.\n\n### 5\n. Check Your `robots.txt` File\n\nEnsure you are not blocking Google from crawling the pages with your embedded videos or any\n of the resources needed to render them. Your `robots.txt` file should not have rules like:\n\n\n```\n\nDisallow: /videos/\nDisallow: /wp-content/plugins/your-video-plugin/\n\n```\n\n\n### 6. Use the Standard YouTube Embed Code\n\nWhile there are many plugins and custom players, the standard `<iframe>\n` embed code from YouTube is the most reliable for indexing.\n\n\n```html\n<iframe width=\"560\" height\n=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID\" title\n=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture\n-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n```\n\n\n### 7. Avoid Common Mistakes\n\n*   **\nPrivate or Deleted Videos:** Make sure the YouTube video is public and not deleted.\n*   **Canonicalization:** The\n page with the embedded video should be the canonical version. If you have duplicate pages, use the `rel=\"canonical\"` tag\n to point to the correct one.\n*   **Mobile-Friendly:** Ensure your page and the video embed are mobile-friendly\n.\n\nAfter you've made these changes, go back to Google Search Console, find the page with the video,\n and use the **URL Inspection** tool to request re-indexing. It may take some time for Google to recrawl and index your\n video, so be patient.","hint":"A good answer must explain common reasons embedded YouTube videos aren’t indexed on blog posts (e.g., not considered a “video watch page,” video outside viewport/not prominent, JavaScript/lazy-load or faulty embed preventing detection) and outline concrete 2024-specific fixes aligned with Google’s video indexing guidelines, such as making the page a proper watch page, ensuring a standard iframe/embed visible on initial load on all devices, adding VideoObject structured data and/or video sitemaps, and using Search Console’s Video Indexing and URL Inspection reports to diagnose and verify indexing.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","timestamp":25373},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":25373},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546015381-7401aa0086f11","status":"completed","timestamp":25373},{"type":"message","content":"It can be frustrating when your embedded YouTube videos aren't indexed in Google Search Console.

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026\nHandling Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated\n`, and `organization.deleted` is essential for keeping your application's data in sync with your Clerk instance. Here is\n a guide on how to handle these events.\n\n### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint\n\nFirst, you need\n an API endpoint in your application that will receive the POST requests from Clerk. This endpoint should be publicly accessible.\n\n### 2\n. Register the Endpoint in Clerk\n\nIn your Clerk Dashboard:\n1.  Navigate to the \"Webhooks\" section\n.\n2.  Click \"Add Endpoint\".\n3.  Paste the URL of the endpoint you created.\n4.  \nSelect the specific organization events to listen for: `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted\n`.\n5.  After creating the endpoint, make sure to copy the **signing secret**. You'll need it\n to verify the authenticity of the webhooks.\n\n### 3. Verify and Handle the Webhook\n\nFor security,\n it is critical to verify that the incoming webhook request is genuinely from Clerk. This is done by checking the signature using the\n signing secret you obtained from the Clerk Dashboard.\n\nThe following is an example using Node.js and Express to handle the\n organization webhooks.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport { Webhook } from 'svix';\n\nimport bodyParser from 'body-parser';\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// You can find this in the Clerk Dashboard ->\n Webhooks -> your endpoint\nconst WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING\n_SECRET;\n\nif (!WEBHOOK_SECRET) {\n  throw new Error('CLERK_WEBHOOK_\nSIGNING_SECRET is not set');\n}\n\n// Middleware to handle raw body parsing\napp.post('/api\n/webhooks/clerk', bodyParser.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), async (req, res) => {\n\n    // Get the headers and body\n    const headers = req.headers;\n    const payload = req.body\n;\n\n    // Get the Svix headers for verification\n    const svix_id = headers['svix-id\n'];\n    const svix_timestamp = headers['svix-timestamp'];\n    const svix_signature = headers\n['svix-signature'];\n\n    // If there are no Svix headers, error out\n    if (!svix_\nid || !svix_timestamp || !svix_signature) {\n        return res.status(40\n0).json({\n            success: false,\n            message: 'Error occured -- no svix headers',\n        });\n\n    }\n\n    // Create a new Svix instance with your secret.\n    const wh = new Webhook(\nWEBHOOK_SECRET);\n\n    let evt;\n\n    // Verify the payload with the headers\n    try {\n        evt\n = wh.verify(payload, {\n            'svix-id': svix_id,\n            'svix-\ntimestamp': svix_timestamp,\n            'svix-signature': svix_signature,\n        });\n\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err);\n        return res.status(4\n00).json({\n            success: false,\n            message: 'Webhook verification failed',\n        });\n\n    }\n\n    // Get the ID and type\n    const { id } = evt.data;\n    const\n eventType = evt.type;\n\n    console.log(`Webhook with an ID of ${id} and type of\n ${eventType}`);\n\n    // Handle the event\n    switch (eventType) {\n        case 'organization.created':\n            \n// This is where you would create the organization in your own database.\n            // The `evt.data` object\n contains the full organization payload.\n            console.log('Organization created:', JSON.stringify(evt.data, null\n, 2));\n            // Example: await db.organizations.create({ id: evt.data.id, name\n: evt.data.name, ... });\n            break;\n\n        case 'organization.updated':\n            // This is\n where you would update the organization in your database.\n            console.log('Organization updated:', JSON.stringify(evt.\ndata, null, 2));\n            // Example: await db.organizations.update({ where: { id:\n evt.data.id }, data: { name: evt.data.name, ... } });\n            break;\n\n        case\n 'organization.deleted':\n            // This is where you would delete or soft-delete the organization from your database.\n\n            console.log('Organization deleted:', JSON.stringify(evt.data, null, 2));\n            \n// For a soft delete, you might set a \"deleted_at\" timestamp or an \"active\" flag.\n\n            // Example: await db.organizations.update({ where: { id: evt.data.id }, data:\n { active: false } });\n            break;\n        \n        default:\n            console.log(`Unhandled event type:\n ${eventType}`);\n    }\n\n    // Acknowledge receipt of the webhook\n    res.status(200).json\n({\n        success: true,\n        message: 'Webhook received',\n    });\n});\n\nconst PORT = process\n.env.PORT || 3000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console\n.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n\n```\n\n\n### Logic for Each Event Type\n\n*   **`organization\n.created`**: When this event is received, you should insert a new record into your database's organizations table. The\n `evt.data` object will contain all the necessary information, such as `id`, `name`, `slug`,\n and any custom attributes. Storing the Clerk Organization ID is crucial for linking it to users and other resources in your application.\n\n\n*   **`organization.updated`**: Use this event to keep your data consistent. When an organization's details are changed\n in Clerk, find the corresponding organization in your database using the `id` from `evt.data` and update its attributes\n.\n\n*   **`organization.deleted`**: When an organization is removed, you must decide how to handle it\n in your application. You could perform a \"hard delete\" to remove the record and all associated data, or a \"soft\n delete\" by marking the record as inactive. A soft delete is often safer as it preserves data integrity and history. The\n `evt.data` object will contain the ID of the organization that was deleted.","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and verify Clerk webhooks for organization events (specifically `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted`) and show, with example handler logic or pseudo-code, how to branch on `event.type` to create/update/delete corresponding organization records (or sync data) in the application’s backend, including basic security (signature verification) and reliability (handling retries/async nature).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","timestamp":29143},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":29143},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546211704-3b81cf5a234be8","status":"completed","timestamp":29143},{"type":"message","content":"Handling Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated","timestamp":29143},{"type":"message","content":"`, and `organization.deleted` is essential for keeping your application's data in sync with your Clerk instance.

{"id":"websearch-738","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026\nIn 2026, for internationalization (i1\n8n) in Kotlin Multiplatform projects, the most efficient and recommended approach is to use a dedicated i18n library that\n leverages code generation. While you can use KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) to create your own solution, established libraries like `i\n18n4k` and `moko-resources` offer robust, pre-built solutions that are easier to set\n up and maintain. These libraries use their own Gradle plugins, which may use KSP under the hood, to generate type\n-safe accessors for your translated strings.\n\nHere's a guide on how to use `i18n4k`,\n a popular choice for i18n in Kotlin Multiplatform:\n\n### Using i18n4k for I\n18n Code Generation\n\n`i18n4k` is a multiplatform library that simplifies the process of adding\n i18n to your Kotlin projects. It uses a Gradle plugin to generate code that allows you to access your translations\n in a type-safe manner.\n\n#### 1. Setup the Gradle Plugin\n\nFirst, you need to add the `i1\n8n4k` Gradle plugin to your project's `build.gradle.kts` file:\n\n\n```kotlin\n\nplugins {\n    id(\"de.comahe.i18n4k\") version \"0.1\n1.1\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThen, configure the plugin in your `build.gradle.kts` file\n. You can specify which locales to include in the source code and which to load at runtime.\n\n\n```kotlin\ni18n\n4k {\n    // Locales to be included in the source code\n    sourceCodeLocales = listOf(\"en\n\")\n    // Locales to be loaded from resource files\n    resourceLocales = listOf(\"de\", \"fr\")\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n#### 2. Add Dependencies\n\nNext, add the `i18n4k-core` dependency to\n the `commonMain` source set in your `build.gradle.kts` file:\n\n\n```kotlin\nsourceSets {\n    \nval commonMain by getting {\n        dependencies {\n            implementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4\nk:i18n4k-core:0.11.1\")\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\nDepending on your target platforms, you may also need to add platform-specific dependencies (e.g.,\n `i18n4k-core-jvm`, `i18n4k-core-js`).\n\n\n#### 3. Create Message Bundles\n\nBy default, `i18n4k` looks for translation files in the\n `src/commonMain/i18n` directory. You can create subdirectories to organize your translations by feature\n or module.\n\nCreate `.properties` files for each language you want to support. For example, to support English and German,\n you would create `MyMessages_en.properties` and `MyMessages_de.properties`:\n\n**`src/common\nMain/i18n/com/example/MyMessages_en.properties`**\n\n```properties\nhello\n = Hello, {0}!\nwelcome = Welcome to our app.\n\n```\n\n\n**`src/commonMain/\ni18n/com/example/MyMessages_de.properties`**\n\n```properties\nhello = Hallo\n, {0}!\nwelcome = Willkommen in unserer App.\n\n```\n\n\n#### 4. Generate Code\n\nAfter\n setting up the plugin and creating your message bundles, you can generate the code by running the `generateI18n4\nk` Gradle task:\n\n\n```bash\n./gradlew generateI18n4k\n```\n\n\nThis will generate\n a Kotlin object with type-safe accessors for your translations. For the example above, it will generate an object named\n `MyMessages` in the `com.example` package.\n\n#### 5. Use the Generated Code\n\nYou\n can now use the generated code to access your translations in a type-safe manner:\n\n\n```kotlin\nimport com.\nexample.MyMessages\n\nfun main() {\n    println(MyMessages.hello(\"World\"))\n    println(My\nMessages.welcome)\n}\n\n```\n\n\nTo switch the language at runtime, you can change the locale in the `i\n18n4k` configuration:\n\n\n```kotlin\nimport de.comahe.i18n4k.i\n18n4k\nimport de.comahe.i18n4k.config.I18n4\nkConfigDefault\nimport de.comahe.i18n4k.Locale\n\nfun main() {\n\n    // Set the locale to German\n    val config = I18n4kConfigDefault()\n    i\n18n4k = config\n    config.locale = Locale(\"de\")\n\n    println(MyMessages.hello(\"\nWelt\")) // Prints \"Hallo, Welt!\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Advanced Approach: Modular I18n\n\n\nFor more complex projects, you can adopt a modular approach to i18n, as described in [this blog post by Thomas\n Kioko](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization/). This approach involves:\n\n*   **A\n generator module**: Responsible for generating the i18n code.\n*   **An API module**: Defines the interfaces\n for accessing the translations.\n*   **An implementation module**: Provides the platform-specific implementations for loading the translations.\n\nThis\n modular approach offers several benefits, including better separation of concerns, improved testability, and easier maintenance.\n\n### KSP vs. Dedicated\n I18n Libraries\n\nWhile you can write your own KSP processor to generate i18n code, it\n's a more involved process that requires a deep understanding of KSP and code generation. The existing i18n\n libraries like `i18n4k` and `moko-resources` have already solved this problem and provide\n a robust and well-tested solution. These libraries may even use KSP internally, but they abstract away the complexities of code generation and\n provide a simple and easy-to-use API.\n\nIn conclusion, for i18n in Kotlin Multiplatform projects\n in 2026, it is recommended to use a dedicated library like `i18n4k`. This will\n save you time and effort, and it will allow you to focus on building your app's features rather than reinventing the wheel.","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and run a KSP processor in a modern (K2-era) Kotlin Multiplatform project (e.g., using `ksp<target>`/`ksp<SourceSet>` and `kspCommonMainMetadata`) and show how that processor is used to generate type‑safe i18n resources or accessors from source files (such as message bundles) that work across platforms.

Running\n it now to get the TTFB.\nTo compute the Time To First Byte (TTFB) using `httpx`, you can leverage the `trace` extension to\n monitor the internal events of the request/response cycle. By capturing the timestamps of specific events, you can accurately measure the\n TTFB.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\nThe `trace` extension in `httpx` allows you to register a callback\n function that gets called for various events during the lifecycle of a request. To calculate TTFB, we are interested in two\n main events:\n\n1.  `connection.send_request_headers.started`: This event marks the point in\n time when `httpx` starts sending the request headers. This is our starting point for the TTFB measurement.\n\n2.  `connection.receive_response_headers.complete`: This event marks the point in time when `htt\npx` has finished receiving the response headers from the server. This is our ending point for the TTFB measurement, as\n the headers are the first part of the response.\n\n### Python Code\n\nHere is a Python script that demonstrates how to\n calculate TTFB using `httpx`:\n\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef main():\n    \n\"\"\"\n    This script calculates the Time To First Byte (TTFB) for an HTTP request\n    using the htt\npx library's trace extension.\n    \"\"\"\n    timing = {}\n\n    def log_trace(event_\nname, info):\n        \"\"\"\n        A callback function to be used with the httpx trace extension.\n        \nIt records the timestamps of the start of sending request headers and\n        the completion of receiving response headers.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        if event_name == \"connection.send_request_headers.started\":\n            timing[\"start\"]\n = time.time()\n        elif event_name == \"connection.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n\n            timing[\"end\"] = time.time()\n\n    # Use the 'trace' extension to register the callback function\n\n    with httpx.Client(extensions={\"trace\": log_trace}) as client:\n        try:\n\n            # Make a request to a website\n            response = client.get(\"https://www.example.com\")\n\n            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n\n            # Calculate the\n TTFB\n            if \"start\" in timing and \"end\" in timing:\n                ttfb = timing[\"\nend\"] - timing[\"start\"]\n                print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.4f} seconds\n\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Could not determine TTFB.

Run the script from your terminal:\n    \n```bash\n    python calculate_ttfb.py\n    ```\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  **`timing\n = {}`**: We initialize a dictionary to store the timestamps of the start and end events.\n2.  **\n`log_trace(event_name, info)`**: This function is our trace callback. It checks the `event\n_name` and, if it matches our target events, it records the current time in the `timing` dictionary.\n\n3.  **`httpx.Client(extensions={\"trace\": log_trace})`**: We create an\n `httpx.Client` instance and use the `extensions` parameter to register our `log_trace` function as a callback for\n trace events.\n4.  **`client.get(\"https://www.example.com\")`**: We\n make a GET request to the target URL.\n5.  **`ttfb = timing[\"end\"] - timing\n[\"start\"]`**: After the request is complete, we calculate the TTFB by subtracting the `start` timestamp from\n the `end` timestamp.\n6.  **Error Handling**: The `try...except` block is included to\n catch potential `httpx.RequestError` exceptions that might occur if there's a problem with the request.\n\n\nThis approach provides a reliable way to measure TTFB by tapping into the low-level events within `httpx`, giving\n you accurate insights into the performance of your HTTP requests.","hint":"Answer must explain that you use HTTPX’s trace extension/callback (or equivalent event hooks) to capture timing events (e.g., connection start/complete and response_headers or response_started) and then compute TTFB as the time difference between the request start and the first-byte/response-headers event, optionally mentioning using monotonic time and how to attach the callback in Python.

{"id":"websearch-842","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?\nBased on the latest\n advancements and looking towards 2026, here are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging\n using Vertex AI:\n\n### 1. **Mastering the Basics: Clear and Concise Prompting**\n\nThe foundation of successful\n prompt engineering lies in creating clear and unambiguous prompts. For bounding box detection in medical imaging, your prompts should include the following elements\n:\n\n*   **Task-Specific Instructions:** Clearly state that you want to perform bounding box detection.\n*   **\nObject Identification:** Specify the exact objects or anatomical structures you want to identify in the image.\n*   **Output Format:** Define\n the desired output format for the bounding box coordinates. JSON is a common choice for its machine-readability.\n\n**\nExample Prompt:**\n\n\n```\n\"Please perform bounding box detection on the provided chest X-ray image. Identify any nodules\n and provide the bounding box coordinates in JSON format. The coordinates should be normalized from 0 to 1000\n.\"\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. **Leveraging Advanced Models: Gemini 2.0 and Beyond**\n\nAs\n we move towards 2026, models like Gemini 2.0 and its successors will offer increasingly sophisticated capabilities for computer\n vision tasks. These models are designed to understand complex instructions and deliver more accurate results.\n\nTo make the most of these\n advanced models, your prompts can include more nuanced instructions, such as:\n\n*   **Contextual Information:** Provide context about\n the image, such as the patient's history or the reason for the scan. This can help the model to better\n understand the image and identify relevant findings.\n*   **Negative Prompts:** Specify what you *don't*\n want the model to identify. This can help to reduce false positives.\n*   **Chain of Thought Prompting:** Ask\n the model to \"think step by step\" to break down the detection process and improve accuracy.\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n\n\n```\n\"This is a CT scan of a patient with a history of lung cancer. Please identify any new or growing nodules,\n while ignoring any stable or benign-appearing nodules. Provide the bounding box coordinates in JSON format, along with a confidence score for each detection\n. Think step by step to ensure accuracy.\"\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. **Weakly Supervised Learning: A\n Cost-Effective Approach**\n\nThe cost and time required for detailed, pixel-wise annotations in medical imaging are significant challenges.\n Weakly supervised learning offers a solution by using less precise annotations, such as bounding boxes, to train the model.\n\n\nIn the context of prompt engineering, this means you can use a combination of prompts and bounding box annotations to guide the model's\n learning process. For example, you can provide a prompt that asks the model to identify a specific type of tumor, and then provide\n a few examples of bounding boxes around those tumors in a small set of training images. This can help the model to learn the visual\n features of the tumor and then identify it in new images.\n\n### 4. **3D Bounding Box Detection for Volumetric\n Data**\n\nMedical imaging often involves volumetric data, such as CT and MRI scans. For these types of images, 2\nD bounding boxes are not sufficient. 3D bounding box detection is required to accurately localize objects in three-dimensional space.\n\n\nWhile prompt engineering for 3D bounding box detection is still an emerging area, the same principles of clarity and specificity apply. Your\n prompts should specify that you require 3D bounding boxes and define the desired output format for the 3D coordinates.\n\n\n### 5. **Utilizing External Tools and Libraries**\n\nSeveral tools and libraries can help you to work with Vertex\n AI and improve your prompt engineering workflow. For example, the Ultralytics Python package provides functions for drawing bounding boxes on images and converting\n between different coordinate systems.\n\nBy using these tools, you can more easily visualize the results of your bounding box detection and\n iterate on your prompts to improve their accuracy.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAs we look towards 2026, prompt\n engineering for bounding box detection in medical imaging with Vertex AI will continue to evolve. By mastering the fundamentals of clear and concise prompting\n, leveraging the power of advanced models like Gemini, and exploring innovative techniques like weakly supervised learning, you can unlock the full potential of\n AI for medical image analysis.","hint":"A good answer must describe concrete prompt-engineering patterns for Gemini/Vertex AI image models (e.g., specifying task context, strict JSON schema for bounding box outputs, coordinate normalization system, label set, and confidence thresholds) and explicitly tie them to medical imaging use cases (e.g., multi-class lesions, small objects, multi-scale/pathology-specific prompts). It should also mention at least one Vertex AI–specific aspect (such as using Vertex AI Studio, Generative AI “bounding box detection” APIs, or AutoML/Vertex AI Vision evaluation metrics like IoU or mean average precision) to show awareness of the 2026 Vertex AI tooling context.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","timestamp":27312},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":27312},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546641143-e0431c1c7a1568","status":"completed","timestamp":27312},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest","timestamp":27312},{"type":"message","content":" advancements and looking towards 2026, here are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging","timestamp":27312},{"type":"message","content":" using Vertex AI:\n\n### 1. **Mastering the Basics: Clear and Concise Prompting**\n\nThe foundation of successful","timestamp":27312},{"type":"message","content":" prompt engineering lies in creating clear and unambiguous prompts.

Apps must be prepared to draw underneath the system status and navigation bars to provide a modern, immersive user experience\n.\n*   **Respecting Insets is Mandatory:** To prevent UI elements from being hidden or non-interactive, developers\n must use the `WindowInsets` APIs to adjust layouts and padding dynamically. Hardcoding values is strongly discouraged.\n*\n   **Gesture Navigation is the Norm:** The design and layout of applications should prioritize gesture navigation. While 3-button navigation\n is still supported, it is no longer the primary mode of interaction.\n\n### Inset Handling Guidelines\n\n1.  **\nUse the `WindowInsetsCompat` API:** This is the standard for accessing information about system UI elements.\n\n2.  **\nPrioritize `safeContent()`:** For most use cases, the `WindowInsets.safeContent` inset type is recommended\n. It provides a convenient combination of `safeDrawing()` and `safeGestures()` to ensure that interactive elements are not visually\n obscured and do not conflict with system gestures.\n\n3.  **Differentiate Inset Types:**\n    *   **\n`systemBars()`:** Use this for general padding around the status and navigation bars.\n    *   **`safe\nDrawing()`:**  Use this to prevent your content from being drawn underneath system UI elements.\n    *   **`ime\n()`:** Use this to react to the on-screen keyboard appearing and disappearing.\n\n### Navigation Bar and Gesture Insets\n\n\n1.  **Avoid Conflicts with Gesture Navigation:** Do not place interactive UI elements (like buttons or sliders) within the gesture\n navigation areas at the edges of the screen. Use the `systemGestureInsets` to identify these zones and add appropriate padding or margins to\n your layouts.\n\n2.  **Transparent Navigation Bar:** For a seamless edge-to-edge experience, the navigation\n bar should be transparent.\n    *   **Jetpack Compose:** This is handled automatically when you use `enableEdgeToEdge()\n` in your `Activity`.\n    *   **XML Layouts:** Set `<item name=\"android:navigationBarColor\">@\nandroid:color/transparent</item>` in your app's theme.\n\n3.  **Provide Visual Contrast:** When\n the navigation bar is transparent, ensure that the content drawn behind it provides sufficient contrast for the navigation handle to be visible. Android\n will automatically apply a translucent scrim in some cases, but it's best to design for this scenario.\n\n### Implementation\n Best Practices\n\n*   **Jetpack Compose:** The `Scaffold` composable from Material 3 is the recommended starting\n point. It automatically handles most inset-related scenarios. You can access and apply insets using modifiers like `Modifier.windowInsets\nPadding(WindowInsets.safeDrawing)`.\n*   **View-Based UI (XML):** Use `View\nCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` to listen for inset changes and dynamically update the padding and margins of your views.\n\n*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your application on a variety of devices, including those with different screen sizes, aspect ratios,\n and display cutouts. Also, test with both gesture navigation and 3-button navigation to ensure a consistent experience.","hint":"A correct answer must mention the modern Android edge-to-edge requirements (Android 15+ / 2026-era) and explain handling WindowInsets for both system bar insets and system gesture insets, including using safe drawing/gesture areas (e.g., WindowInsets.safeGestures / safeContent in Compose) to keep tappable content and app gestures out of the navigation bar’s gesture regions.[[1, 2, 3]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","timestamp":24808},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":24808},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546680752-403f7b4acac26","status":"completed","timestamp":24808},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546680784-11f0f55590837","status":"completed","timestamp":24808},{"type":"message","content":"Here are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar","timestamp":24808},{"type":"message","content":" gesture insets, based on the latest Android development best practices.\n\n### Key Principles for 2026\n\n*   **","timestamp":24808},{"type":"message","content":"Edge-to-Edge by Default:** With Android 15 (API 35) and higher, edge-to-edge","timestamp":24808},{"type":"message","content":" rendering is enforced.

Proliferation of Multi-\nAgent Systems:**\n\n*   The primary trend is a definitive shift from single, general-purpose AI models to multi-agent systems.\n These systems are composed of multiple, specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This approach is proving to be more efficient\n and effective than relying on a single agent.\n\n**2. Rise of Orchestration Frameworks:**\n\n*   To\n manage the complexity of multi-agent systems, a variety of orchestration frameworks have emerged. These frameworks provide the tools to coordinate\n communication, delegate tasks, and manage workflows between different agents. Popular frameworks in 2025 include LangChain, CrewAI\n, AutoGen, and LangGraph.\n\n**3. Hierarchical Team Management and \"Puppeteer\" Models:**\n\n*   \nA key trend in multi-agent systems is the adoption of hierarchical structures. In this model, a primary \"orchestrator\n\" or \"puppeteer\" agent manages a team of specialized \"worker\" agents. This allows for a clear division of labor,\n with the orchestrator breaking down complex tasks and assigning them to the most suitable agents.\n\n**4. Flatter Organizational\n Structures and Human-AI Teaming:**\n\n*   The integration of AI agents into the workforce is leading to significant changes in organizational design\n. AI agents are increasingly viewed as \"cybernetic teammates\" that augment human capabilities. This is resulting in flatter organizational hierarchies\n, with a reduction in middle management layers as AI agents take on more coordination and project management tasks.\n\n**5. Standardization\n of Agent-to-Agent Communication:**\n\n*   As the use of multi-agent systems becomes more widespread, the\n need for standardized communication protocols is growing. Companies like Anthropic (Model Context Protocol - MCP) and Google (Agent-\nto-Agent Protocol - A2A) are developing foundational protocols to enable seamless interoperability between different AI agents and systems.\n\n**\n6. Emphasis on Governance, Safety, and Compliance:**\n\n*   With the increasing autonomy of AI agents, there is a strong\n focus on ensuring their safe and responsible operation. Governance frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk\n Management Framework and regulations such as the EU AI Act are becoming critical for managing the risks associated with agentic systems.\n\n\n**7. Emergence of Specialized AI Agents:**\n\n*   There is a growing trend towards creating highly specialized AI agents designed\n for specific tasks or domains. For example, frameworks like MetaGPT simulate a software development team with agents that have distinct roles\n like project manager, developer, and quality assurance engineer. This specialization allows for greater efficiency and expertise in complex workflows.\n\n**8\n. Growth of Low-Code and No-Code Platforms:**\n\n*   The development of low-code and no-code\n platforms is democratizing the creation of AI agents. These platforms enable individuals without extensive programming knowledge to build and deploy AI-\npowered applications, which is accelerating the adoption of agentic AI across various industries.\n\nIn summary, 202\n5 is a pivotal year for AI agent coordination and hierarchical team management. The focus has shifted from individual AI agents to the development\n of sophisticated multi-agent systems, complete with orchestration frameworks, hierarchical structures, and standardized communication protocols. This is not only transforming\n the way AI is used to solve problems but is also reshaping the future of work and organizational design.","hint":"A good answer should highlight 2024–2025 trends in LLM-based multi-agent systems, including coordination/topology innovations (e.g., hierarchical / leader–follower structures, orchestrator or “puppeteer” agents, hybrid centralized–decentralized control, and workflow graphs) and concrete examples or frameworks (such as AutoGen, LangGraph, CrewAI, GPTSwarm/AFlow/AgentNet, or similar) that enable role-specialized agents to collaborate on complex tasks; it should also mention emerging standards or challenges in large-scale coordination (e.g., task allocation, communication protocols, or scalability/latency issues).【page1websearch1 page3websearch1 page4websearch1 page5websearch1 page8websearch1 page10websearch1 page16websearch1","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest trends in AI agent coordination and hierarchical team management for 2025?","timestamp":28337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":28337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546839807-c5e4dcb49067d","status":"completed","timestamp":28337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546839816-e60365c60a6b9","status":"completed","timestamp":28337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546839836-2b2fec1190895","status":"completed","timestamp":28337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546839854-7c68b16288bc5","status":"completed","timestamp":28337},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here are the","timestamp":28337},{"type":"message","content":" key trends in AI agent coordination and hierarchical team management for 2025:\n\n**1.

{"id":"websearch-915","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025?\nHere\n is a comprehensive guide to setting up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025. This guide is\n based on the latest information and best practices.\n\n### 1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file\n\n\nFirst, you need to create a `docker-compose.yml` file. This file will define the services required\n to run Guacamole, including the Guacamole web application, the `guacd` service, and the PostgreSQL database.\n\nCreate\n a file named `docker-compose.yml` and add the following content:\n\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.8'\n\n\nservices:\n  guacamole:\n    image: guacamole/guacamole:1.5.5\n    container\n_name: guacamole\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:808\n0\"\n    environment:\n      GUACAMOLE_HOME: /config\n      GUACD_HOSTNAME\n: guacd\n      POSTGRES_HOSTNAME: db\n      POSTGRES_DATABASE: guacamole_db\n      POST\nGRES_USER: guacamole_user\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-super-secret-password\n    volumes\n:\n      - ./config:/config\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n      - guacd\n\n  guacd\n:\n    image: guacamole/guacd:1.5.5\n    container_name: guacd\n    restart\n: unless-stopped\n    volumes:\n      - ./drive:/drive:rw\n      - ./record:/record\n:rw\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:15\n    container_name: guacamole_db\n    \nrestart: unless-stopped\n    volumes:\n      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    \nenvironment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES_USER: guacamole_user\n\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-super-secret-password\n      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql\n/data/pgdata\n\n  init-db:\n    image: guacamole/guacamole:1.5.5\n    \ncommand: [\"/opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh\", \"--postgresql\"]\n    depends_on:\n\n      - db\n    volumes:\n      - ./init:/init\n\nvolumes:\n  data:\n  config\n:\n  drive:\n  record:\n  init:\n\n```\n\n\n**Important:** Replace `your-super\n-secret-password` with a strong, unique password.\n\n### 2. Initialize the Database\n\nBefore starting the\n Guacamole services, you need to initialize the PostgreSQL database with the required schema. The `init-db` service in the\n `docker-compose.yml` file will do this for you.\n\nRun the following command to start the database initialization process\n:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose run --rm init-db > ./init/initdb.sql\n```\n\n\nThis\n command will execute the `initdb.sh` script from the Guacamole image and save the output to a file named\n `initdb.sql` in the `init` directory.\n\nNext, you need to apply the generated SQL script\n to the PostgreSQL database. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose exec -T\n db psql -U guacamole_user -d guacamole_db -f /init/initdb.sql\n\n```\n\n\n###\n 3. Start the Services\n\nNow that the database is initialized, you can start all the services using the following command\n:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n\nThis command will start the Guacamole, `guacd`, and\n PostgreSQL containers in the background.\n\n### 4. Access Guacamole\n\nOnce the services are running, you can access\n the Guacamole web interface by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.\n\nThe\n default username and password are:\n\n*   **Username:** `guacadmin`\n*   **Password:** `guacadmin\n`\n\nYou will be prompted to change your password upon your first login.\n\n### 5. Troubleshooting\n\n*   **Check\n container logs:** If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of each container using the `docker-compose logs` command\n. For example, to check the logs of the `guacamole` container, run `docker-compose logs guacamole`.\n\n*   **Permissions:** Ensure that the directories you created (`config`, `data`, `drive`, `record`, and \n`init`) have the correct permissions for the Docker user.\n*   **Database connection:** If Guacamole cannot connect to the database\n, double-check that the `POSTGRES_HOSTNAME`, `POSTGRES_DATABASE`, `POSTGRES_USER`,\n and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variables are set correctly in the `docker-compose.yml` file.\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully set up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database.","hint":"A good answer should outline a Docker-based setup with three components (guacd container, Guacamole web app container, and a PostgreSQL container), show how to initialize the Guacamole PostgreSQL schema using the initdb.sh script or equivalent, and specify the essential environment variables linking Guacamole to Postgres (e.g., POSTGRES_HOSTNAME, POSTGRES_DATABASE, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD) and exposing the web UI (port 8080).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025?","timestamp":20341},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":20341},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546884383-608f1c983224","status":"completed","timestamp":20341},{"type":"message","content":"Here","timestamp":20341},{"type":"message","content":" is a comprehensive guide to setting up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025.

The `payload` (in this case,\n a dictionary with a question and details) is returned to the caller of the graph in the `__interrupt__` field of\n the result.\n*   **Checkpointer (`InMemorySaver`)**: This is crucial. It saves the state of the graph when\n it's interrupted, allowing it to be resumed from the exact same point.\n*   **`graph.invoke(...,\n resume=...)`**: When you are ready to provide the human's input back to the graph, you call `invoke\n` again with the same `thread_id` and pass the user's response to the `resume` argument. This\n value will be the return value of the `interrupt()` call within the node.\n*   **`Command` Object**: While\n the `resume` argument in `invoke` is a shorthand, you can also use the `Command` object directly, like\n `graph.invoke(Command(resume=\"yes\"), config=config)`. The `Command` object is more versatile and\n can also be used for routing (`goto`) and state updates (`update`) directly from a node, allowing for more complex and\n dynamic control flow within your graph.","hint":"A good answer must explain that in LangGraph Python you trigger a human pause inside a node with `interrupt()` (or corresponding HumanInterrupt types), which requires a checkpointer, and then resume by re‑invoking the graph with a `Command` object whose `resume` field supplies the human’s response back into the node (possibly using the same `thread_id`/config so the saved state is restored).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","timestamp":33843},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":33843},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546919460-a7961b673f1bb","status":"completed","timestamp":33843},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546919472-9945a8fd473b6","status":"completed","timestamp":33843},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770546919492-50663cdd6b201","status":"completed","timestamp":33843},{"type":"message","content":"In 2026, implementing human-in-","timestamp":33843},{"type":"message","content":"the-loop patterns in LangGraph for Python involves using the `interrupt()` function to pause graph execution and the `Command` object","timestamp":33843},{"type":"message","content":" to resume it.

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026\nPyTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing due to the way operating systems handle process creation and resource\n sharing, especially with libraries that use multi-threading internally like PyTorch. This is a long-standing issue, and the solutions\n are still very relevant in 2026.\n\nHere are the common causes and how to fix them:\n\n###\n 1. Change the Multiprocessing Start Method\n\nThe most common cause of deadlocks is the default `fork` start\n method for multiprocessing on Linux. When a process is forked, it inherits the memory space of the parent process, including the\n state of any mutexes or locks. If a lock is held by a thread in the parent process at the time of forking,\n it will also be locked in the child process, but the thread that could release it doesn't exist in the child,\n leading to a deadlock.\n\nThe recommended solution is to use the `spawn` or `forkserver` start methods. These methods start\n a fresh Python interpreter process, which avoids inheriting locks from the parent process.\n\nYou can set the start method at the beginning\n of your main script:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    # Set the start method to 'spawn'\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn')\n\n\n    # Your multiprocessing code here\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Load the Model and Initialize CUDA in the Subprocess\n\nTo\n avoid issues with CUDA context and file handles, you should load your model and perform any CUDA-related initializations *inside\n* the subprocess, not in the main process before starting the subprocesses.\n\nHere is an example of how to structure\n your code:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\n\n# Define a simple model for demonstration\nclass MyModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        \nsuper(MyModel, self).__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5\n)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(x)\n\ndef worker(rank\n, world_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function will be executed in a separate process.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\nf\"Worker {rank}: Initializing.\")\n\n    # 1. Set up the process group (if doing distributed training)\n\n    # torch.distributed.init_process_group(\"gloo\", rank=rank, world_size=world_\nsize)\n\n    # 2. Initialize the model inside the subprocess\n    model = MyModel()\n\n    # If\n you have a saved model, load it here\n    # model.load_state_dict(torch.load(\"\nmy_model.pth\"))\n\n    # 3. If using a GPU, move the model to the correct device\n\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        device = torch.device(f\"cuda:{rank}\")\n        \nmodel.to(device)\n        print(f\"Worker {rank}: Model moved to {device}\")\n\n\n    # Your\n training or inference code here\n    print(f\"Worker {rank}: Initialization complete.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main\n__\":\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn')\n    world_size = 2 # Number of processes\n\n    processes = []\n    for rank in range(world_size):\n        p = mp.Process(target\n=worker, args=(rank, world_size))\n        p.start()\n        processes.append(p\n)\n\n    for p in processes:\n        p.join()\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Set `OMP_NUM\n_THREADS=1`\n\nSometimes, conflicts can arise between the multi-threading used by PyTorch (via OpenMP)\n and the multiprocessing module. To mitigate this, you can try setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable to `1\n`.\n\nYou can do this in your shell before running your Python script:\n\n```bash\nexport OMP_NUM\n_THREADS=1\npython your_script.py\n\n```\n\nOr you can set it within your Python script using\n the `os` module, before importing PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OMP_\nNUM_THREADS\"] = \"1\"\nimport torch\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Use `torch.multiprocessing.spawn\n`\n\nPyTorch provides a convenience function `torch.multiprocessing.spawn` that handles some of the setup for you and\n is generally recommended for distributed training. It automatically manages the creation and termination of processes.\n\nHere is an example using `spawn`:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass MyModel(nn\n.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n        \nself.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n\n        return self.linear(x)\n\ndef worker(rank, world_size):\n    print(f\"\nWorker {rank}: Initializing.\")\n    model = MyModel()\n    if torch.cuda.is_available\n():\n        device = torch.device(f\"cuda:{rank}\")\n        model.to(device)\n\n        print(f\"Worker {rank}: Model moved to {device}\")\n    print(f\"Worker {rank\n}: Initialization complete.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    world_size = 2\n    mp\n.spawn(worker,\n             args=(world_size,),\n             nprocs=world_size,\n             \njoin=True)\n\n```\n\n\nBy following these recommendations, you should be able to avoid deadlocks when loading PyTorch models with multiprocessing\n. The key is to start with a clean slate in each subprocess by using the `spawn` start method and initializing all\n resources within the subprocess itself.","hint":"A correct answer should explain that PyTorch multiprocessing deadlocks when loading models are typically caused by using the default `fork` start method with background threads / CUDA, and must mention switching to a safe start method like `'spawn'` or `'forkserver'` and/or following PyTorch’s multiprocessing best practices (e.g., guarding code with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`, avoiding problematic queues/threads, or using `DistributedDataParallel` instead of manual multiprocessing) as the primary fix.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","timestamp":29681},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":29681},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770547032774-cca2897f37dd2","status":"completed","timestamp":29681},{"type":"message","content":"PyTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing due to the way operating systems handle process creation and resource","timestamp":29681},{"type":"message","content":" sharing, especially with libraries that use multi-threading internally like PyTorch.

{"id":"websearch-990","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?\nBased on the latest research in 2024 and 2025, the field\n of large language model (LLM) reasoning is rapidly advancing, with a significant focus on reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for\n data selection and model training. Here are some of the latest data selection techniques:\n\n### 1. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable\n Rewards (RLVR)\n\nA major shift from Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), RLVR utilizes datasets with\n verifiable outcomes. Instead of relying on subjective human annotations, the reward signal is based on whether the model's output is\n verifiably correct. This is particularly effective for tasks like mathematical problem-solving and code generation, where the correctness of a\n solution can be automatically checked.\n\n**Data Selection:** The key here is the selection of datasets where the final answer can\n be verified for correctness. This includes:\n\n*   **Mathematical reasoning datasets:** Datasets like GSM8K and MATH,\n where the final numerical answer can be checked.\n*   **Code generation datasets:** Datasets where the generated code can be executed\n against a set of unit tests to verify its correctness.\n*   **Scientific reasoning datasets:** Datasets where the model\n's conclusions can be compared against established scientific knowledge or experimental results.\n\n### 2. Process-based vs. Outcome-\nbased Reward Models\n\n*   **Outcome Reward Models (ORMs):** These models provide a reward based on the final outcome\n of the reasoning process. This is the more common approach in RLVR. The data selection for ORMs is focused on problems\n with clear, verifiable final answers.\n\n*   **Process Reward Models (PRMs):** PRMs provide a reward for\n each step in the reasoning process. This is a more fine-grained approach that can guide the model towards a correct reasoning\n path. However, PRMs are more computationally expensive. The data selection for PRMs requires datasets with human-annotated\n step-by-step solutions, which are more costly to create.\n\n### 3. Group Relative Policy Optimization (\nGRPO)\n\nGRPO is an advanced RL algorithm that has gained prominence in 2024 and 20\n25. It is an improvement over Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and is designed to be more sample-efficient and stable\n for training large models. While GRPO is an algorithm, it influences data selection by enabling more effective learning from smaller,\n higher-quality datasets.\n\n### 4. Synthetic Data Generation and Data Mixing\n\nA significant trend is the use of synthetic\n data to train LLMs for reasoning tasks. This involves using a powerful \"teacher\" model to generate a large dataset of problems and solutions\n, which is then used to train a smaller \"student\" model.\n\n**Data Selection Techniques:**\n\n*   **Optimizing Data\n Mixes:** Researchers are focusing on finding the optimal mix of real-world and synthetic data to achieve the best performance. This involves\n carefully selecting the types of problems and the distribution of difficulty levels in the training data.\n*   **Domain-Specific Data:** There\n is a growing emphasis on using domain-specific data to train expert models. For example, a model trained on a large corpus\n of medical literature will perform better at medical reasoning tasks.\n\n### 5. Test-Time Scaling and Post-Training RL\n\n\nMany of the latest advancements are not from pre-training but from techniques applied after the initial training phase:\n\n*   \n**Test-Time Reinforcement Learning:** Techniques like TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning) allow the model to learn and\n adapt from data encountered during inference. This is particularly useful for tasks where the data distribution can change over time.\n*   **\nPost-Training Refinement:** Models are increasingly being fine-tuned using RL on specialized datasets to improve their reasoning capabilities. This is\n where techniques like RLVR and GRPO are applied.\n\n### Key Models and Frameworks\n\nThe advancements in data selection and\n RL techniques are reflected in the improved reasoning capabilities of the latest models, including:\n\n*   **OpenAI's\n o1 and o1-mini:** These models, released in late 2024, are specifically designed for\n reasoning tasks and leverage RLVR.\n*   **DeepSeek-R1:** This model from 2025\n also showcases strong reasoning capabilities, achieved through RL.\n*   **Anthropic's Claude 3.7/4 and\n Qwen 3:** These models also incorporate advanced RL techniques for improved reasoning.\n\nIn summary, the trend in \n2024 and 2025 for data selection in LLM reasoning is moving towards more automated, verifiable, and targeted\n approaches.

{"id":"websearch-1029","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I test chrome extension permission warning updates locally by packing the extension in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I test chrome extension permission warning updates locally by packing the extension in 2026?\nYou can't see permission warning updates with an unpacked extension because\n the permissions are granted implicitly during development. To test the permission warning updates locally, you have two primary methods: manually packing the\n extension or using the Extension Update Testing Tool.\n\n### Method 1: Manually Packing the Extension\n\nThis method is\n straightforward and good for a quick verification of the permission warnings that will appear for a new installation or update.\n\n**1. Pack\n the Original Extension:**\n\n*   Go to `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser.\n*   Enable \"\nDeveloper mode\" in the top right corner.\n*   Click the \"Pack extension\" button.\n*   In the\n \"Extension root directory\" field, browse to and select the directory of your extension's older version (the one that\n is supposedly installed by the user).\n*   Leave the \"Private key file\" field empty for the first time.\n*\n   Click \"Pack extension\". This will create a `.crx` file and a `.pem` file. **Keep the `.pem\n` file safe**, as you'll need it to pack subsequent updates.\n\n**2. Install the Packed Extension:**\n\n*\n   Drag and drop the newly created `.crx` file onto the `chrome://extensions` page to install it.\n\n\n**3. Pack the Updated Extension:**\n\n*   Now, make the permission changes in your `manifest.json` file\n for the new version of your extension.\n*   Click \"Pack extension\" again.\n*   Select the directory\n of your updated extension.\n*   This time, for the \"Private key file\", select the `.pem` file that\n was generated in the first step.\n*   Click \"Pack extension\". This will create a new `.crx\n` file for your updated extension.\n\n**4. Simulate the Update:**\n\n*   Go back to the `chrome://extensions` page\n.\n*   **Do not remove the previously installed version.**\n*   Drag and drop the new, updated `.crx\n` file onto the page.\n*   Chrome will now show you the permission warning pop-up, asking you to accept\n the new permissions. The extension will be disabled until the new permissions are granted.\n\n### Method 2: Using the Extension Update Testing\n Tool\n\nThis tool, released by the Chrome team, provides a more realistic simulation of the update process from the Chrome Web Store\n. It runs a local server to deliver the extension update.\n\n**1. Install the Tool:**\n\n*   You'll need\n Node.js installed.\n*   Open your terminal and install the tool globally:\n    \n```bash\n    npm\n install -g extension-update-testing-tool\n    \n```\n\n\n**2. Run the Tool:**\n\n*   In\n your terminal, run the tool. It will start a local web server.\n    \n```bash\n    extension-update-\ntesting-tool\n    \n```\n\n*   The tool will print a URL. Keep this terminal window open.\n\n**\n3. Point your Extension to the Local Update Server:**\n\n*   In your extension's `manifest.json`, you\n need to add an `update_url` field pointing to the local server. The tool's documentation will provide the exact URL to\n use, but it will be something like this:\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"name\": \"My Extension\n\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0\",\n      \"update_url\": \"http://localhost:800\n0/update.xml\",\n      ...\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n**4. Follow the Tool's Instructions:**\n\n\n*   The Extension Update Testing Tool's webpage (at the URL from step 2) will guide you through the process\n of installing the old version and then triggering an update to the new version with the changed permissions. It will show you the exact\n update flow, including the permission warning prompt.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively test the user experience for your\n extension's permission updates before you publish them to the Chrome Web Store.","hint":"A good answer must explain that permission warnings only appear for packed (not unpacked) extensions and describe the correct 2026-compatible workflow: building a new version with changed permissions, using chrome://extensions “Pack extension” to generate a .crx, then installing/updating that .crx locally (or using Google’s extension update testing tooling) to trigger and view the permission-change warning dialog.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I test chrome extension permission warning updates locally by packing the extension in 2026?","timestamp":23948},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":23948},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770547503942-47e32d12e6afb8","status":"completed","timestamp":23948},{"type":"message","content":"You can't see permission warning updates with an unpacked extension because","timestamp":23948},{"type":"message","content":" the permissions are granted implicitly during development.

{"id":"websearch-1049","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation\nHere is a step-by-step\n guide on how to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari for iOS 16.4 and later\n, based on the available documentation.\n\n### **Key Requirements**\n\nBefore you begin, it's crucial to understand the\n following prerequisites for web push notifications to work on iOS:\n\n*   **iOS/iPadOS 16.4\n or Newer:** The device must be running at least iOS 16.4 or iPadOS 16.4.\n\n*   **Add to Home Screen (A2HS):** The user must add your website to their Home Screen\n. Push notifications will only work from the \"installed\" web app, not from the Safari browser directly. This is a critical difference\n from how web push works on desktop and Android devices.\n*   **User Interaction:** Your web app can only request permission\n for notifications in response to a direct user action, such as a button click.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Implementation\n Guide**\n\n#### **1. Create a Web App Manifest File (`manifest.json`)**\n\nThe web app manifest is a\n JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when 'installed' on the user's home\n screen.\n\nCreate a file named `manifest.json` in the root directory of your project and include the following:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your Web App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"WebApp\n\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#\nFFFFFF\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    \n{\n      \"src\": \"path/to/icon-192x192.png\",\n\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"path/to/icon-512x512\n.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image\n/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThen, link to this manifest file from the `<head>` of\n your HTML pages:\n\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n\n####\n **2. Set Up a Service Worker (`sw.js`)**\n\nThe service worker is a script that runs in the\n background, separate from your web page. It's responsible for receiving push messages and displaying notifications.\n\nCreate a file named \n`sw.js` in your root directory with the following content:\n\n\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('push', function\n(event) {\n  const data = event.data.json();\n  const options = {\n    body: data.\nbody,\n    icon: 'path/to/your/icon.png',\n    badge: 'path/to/your\n/badge.png'\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data\n.title, options)\n  );\n});\n\n```\n\n\n#### **3. Register the Service Worker in Your Main\n JavaScript File**\n\nIn your main application JavaScript file, you need to register the service worker.\n\n\n```javascript\nif\n ('serviceWorker' in navigator && 'PushManager' in window) {\n  window.addEventListener('load', ()\n => {\n    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n      .then(swReg => {\n        \nconsole.log('Service Worker is registered', swReg);\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        \nconsole.error('Service Worker Error', err);\n      });\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\n\n#### **4\n. Request Notification Permission and Subscribe**\n\nYou can only request permission after a user action. For example, create a button for\n the user to click to enable notifications.\n\n\n```html\n<button id=\"enable-notifications-button\">Enable Notifications</\nbutton>\n\n```\n\n\n\n```javascript\nconst applicationServerKey = 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY'; //\n Replace with your VAPID public key\n\nfunction urlB64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  \nconst padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const\n base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/\\-/g, '+')\n    .\nreplace(/_/g, '/');\n\n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const output\nArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < raw\nData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\nconst subscribeUser = () => {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.ready\n.then(registration => {\n    const subscribeOptions = {\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey\n: urlB64ToUint8Array(applicationServerKey)\n    };\n\n    return registration.pushManager.subscribe\n(subscribeOptions);\n  })\n  .then(pushSubscription => {\n    console.log('Received Push\nSubscription: ', JSON.stringify(pushSubscription));\n    // Send the subscription object to your server\n    sendSubscriptionToServer\n(pushSubscription);\n    return pushSubscription;\n  });\n};\n\nconst sendSubscriptionToServer = (subscription) => {\n\n  // Your logic to send the subscription object to your server\n  // e.g., using fetch() to a\n POST endpoint\n}\n\ndocument.getElementById('enable-notifications-button').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  \nNotification.requestPermission().then(permission => {\n    if (permission === 'granted') {\n      console.\nlog('Notification permission granted.');\n      subscribeUser();\n    } else {\n      console.log('Unable to get\n permission to notify.');\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n\n#### **5. Send Push Notifications from Your\n Server**\n\nOn your server, you will need a library to send push messages using the VAPID protocol. A\n popular choice for Node.js is the `web-push` library.\n\nFirst, generate VAPID keys:\n\n\n\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\n\nThen, on your server:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\nconst vapidKeys = {\n  publicKey:\n 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY',\n  privateKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_PRIVATE\n_KEY'\n};\n\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.\ncom',\n  vapidKeys.publicKey,\n  vapidKeys.privateKey\n);\n\n// This is the\n subscription object you received from the client\nconst pushSubscription = {\n  endpoint: '...',\n  keys: {\n    \np256dh: '...',\n    auth: '...'\n  }\n};\n\nconst payload = JSON\n.stringify({\n  title: 'New Notification!',\n  body: 'This is the body of the notification.',\n\n});\n\nwebpush.sendNotification(pushSubscription, payload)\n  .catch(error => console.error(\nerror));\n\n```\n\n\n### **Important Considerations for iOS**\n\n*   **Prompting Users to Add to Home Screen:** Since\n adding the site to the home screen is a manual process, you will need to educate your users. A common pattern is to show\n a \"call to action\" or a modal explaining the benefits of adding the app to their home screen and how to do\n it.\n*   **Debugging:** Debugging service workers and push notifications on iOS can be challenging. You will need to connect\n your iPhone to a Mac and use Safari's developer tools to inspect the web app.\n*   **Limitations:** As\n of the current implementations, there might be limitations on what you can do with notifications on iOS compared to other platforms (e\n.g., no support for rich media in notifications).\n\n### **References**\n\n*   [Web Push for Web Apps on iOS\n and iPadOS | WebKit Blog](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-\npush-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/)\n*   [Sending web push notifications in\n web apps and browsers | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending\n-web-push-notifications-in-web-apps-and-browsers)\n*   [iOS web\n push setup - OneSignal Documentation](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/en/web-push-for\n-ios)\n*   [Setup Web Push Notifications on iOS and iPadOS for Safari - PushAlert](https://push\nalert.co/documentation/ios-web-push)","hint":"A correct answer must explain that web push on iOS/iPadOS only works for Safari-installed Home Screen web apps (PWAs) on iOS 16.4+ and must outline the core technical setup: HTTPS PWA with web app manifest and service worker, using the standard Push API/Notification API flow (register service worker, request permission on a user gesture inside the Home Screen app, obtain push subscription, and send via Apple’s Web Push/APNs endpoints) in line with Apple’s 2025/modern documentation.【page2websearch1 page6websearch1 page7websearch1 page9websearch1 page12websearch1 page16websearch1 page18websearch1","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":29397},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":29397},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770547695243-fbebbfafff292","status":"completed","timestamp":29397},{"type":"message","content":"Here is a step-by-step","timestamp":29397},{"type":"message","content":" guide on how to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari for iOS 16.4 and later","timestamp":29397},{"type":"message","content":", based on the available documentation.\n\n### **Key Requirements**\n\nBefore you begin, it's crucial to understand the","timestamp":29397},{"type":"message","content":" following prerequisites for web push notifications to work on iOS:\n\n*   **iOS/iPadOS 16.4","timestamp":29397},{"type":"message","content":" or Newer:** The device must be running at least iOS 16.4 or iPadOS 16.4.","timestamp":29397},{"type":"message","content":"\n*   **Add to Home Screen (A2HS):** The user must add your website to their Home Screen","timestamp":29397},{"type":"message","content":".

{"id":"websearch-1075","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?\nOf course! Here's a guide to using GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers\n, updated for 2024. This guide will focus on the essential concepts and steps to get you started with\n version control for your projects, without any coding.\n\n### **What are GitHub and GitHub Desktop?**\n\n*   **GitHub:**\n Think of GitHub as a cloud-based service for storing and managing your projects. It's not just for code.\n You can use it for any type of file, like documents, design files, or manuscripts. The key feature of GitHub is that it\n tracks every change you make to your project, creating a complete history. This is called \"version control.\" It's like having\n a time machine for your project, allowing you to go back to any previous version.\n\n*   **GitHub Desktop:** This\n is a user-friendly application that lets you interact with GitHub without having to use the command line. It provides a graphical\n interface to manage your projects, track changes, and sync your files with GitHub.\n\n### **Getting Started with GitHub Desktop\n**\n\n**1. Create a GitHub Account**\n\n*   Go to [https://github.com/](https\n://github.com/) and sign up for a free account. You'll just need to choose a username, provide\n an email address, and set a password.\n\n**2. Download and Install GitHub Desktop**\n\n*   Download the\n GitHub Desktop application from the official website: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.\ncom/)\n*   Install it on your computer by following the on-screen instructions.\n\n**3. Connect Your\n GitHub Account**\n\n*   When you launch GitHub Desktop for the first time, it will prompt you to sign in to your GitHub\n account.\n*   Enter your GitHub username and password to connect your account.\n\n### **Core Concepts for Non-\nProgrammers**\n\nHere are a few key terms you'll encounter in GitHub Desktop, explained in simple terms:\n\n*   \n**Repository (or \"Repo\"):** This is just a fancy name for a project folder. A repository contains all the files for\n your project, along with the history of all the changes you've made.\n*   **Clone:** When you \"\nclone\" a repository, you're downloading a copy of it from GitHub to your computer. This allows you to work on\n the files locally.\n*   **Commit:** A \"commit\" is a snapshot of the changes you've made to\n your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a message that describes the changes you made, so you have\n a clear history of your work.\n*   **Push:** When you \"push\" your commits, you're\n uploading your saved changes from your computer to the repository on GitHub. This updates the project on GitHub with your latest work.\n\n*   **Pull:** When you \"pull,\" you're downloading the latest changes from the repository on GitHub to your\n computer. This is useful when you're collaborating with others, as it ensures you have the most up-to-\ndate version of the project.\n\n### **A Simple Workflow: Your First Project**\n\nLet's walk through a simple workflow\n for creating a new project, making changes, and saving them to GitHub.\n\n**1. Create a New Repository on\n GitHub**\n\n*   Log in to your GitHub account on the website.\n*   Click the **+** icon\n in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.\n*   Give your repository a name (e.g., \"\nMy-First-Project\").\n*   You can add a short description if you like.\n*   Check the box\n to **Initialize this repository with a README**. A README file is a place where you can write a description of your project\n.\n*   Click **Create repository**.\n\n**2. Clone the Repository to Your Computer**\n\n*   In GitHub Desktop,\n go to **File > Clone Repository**.\n*   You'll see a list of your repositories on GitHub. Select\n the one you just created (\"My-First-Project\").\n*   Choose a local path on your computer where you want to\n save the project.\n*   Click **Clone**.\n\n**3. Make Changes to Your Project**\n\n*   Go\n to the folder you selected on your computer. You'll see the files from your repository (just the README.md\n file for now).\n*   Open the `README.md` file with a text editor and add some text.\n\n*   You can also add new files to the folder (e.g., a Word document, an image, etc\n.).\n\n**4. Commit Your Changes**\n\n*   Open GitHub Desktop. You'll see a list of the\n changes you've made in the \"Changes\" tab.\n*   In the **Summary** field at the bottom of the\n screen, write a short message that describes your changes (e.g., \"Added a new paragraph to the README\").\n\n*   You can add a more detailed description in the **Description** field if you like.\n*   Click the\n **Commit to main** button.\n\n**5. Push Your Changes to GitHub**\n\n*   After you've committed\n your changes, you'll see a blue button at the top of the GitHub Desktop window that says **Push origin**.\n*   \nClick this button to upload your changes to your repository on GitHub.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThat's it\n! You've successfully created a project, made changes, and saved them to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. You can continue to use this\n workflow to manage your projects, track your progress, and collaborate with others. As you get more comfortable with the basics, you can\n explore more advanced features like branching and pull requests, but for now, this simple workflow is all you need to get started.","hint":"A good answer should explain what GitHub Desktop is and why it’s useful for non‑programmers, then walk through the absolute‑beginner workflow in plain language: installing GitHub Desktop, signing in/creating a GitHub account, creating or cloning a repository, understanding basic concepts (repository, commit, branch, push/pull), and performing simple tasks like adding files and making/syncing changes via the GUI, ideally framed in non‑coding contexts (documents, design files, etc.).","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?","timestamp":25375},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":25375},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770547811725-b92d0e7889d3d","status":"completed","timestamp":25375},{"type":"message","content":"Of course!

{"id":"websearch-1088","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?\n###\n Common Causes of 500 Errors in REST API Customer Endpoints and How to Debug\n Them in 2026\n\nA 500 Internal Server Error is a generic HTTP status code that indicates an\n unexpected condition on the server that prevented it from fulfilling a request. For customer-facing REST API endpoints, these errors can be particularly\n damaging to the user experience and your service's reputation. Here are some of the common causes of 500\n errors and how to debug them in 2026:\n\n### Common Causes of 500 Errors:\n\n\n*   **Unhandled Exceptions:** This is the most frequent cause. An unexpected `null` value, an unhandled exception from\n a library, or a logical error in the code can crash the request-handling thread.\n*   **Database Errors:**\n\n    *   **Connection Timeouts:** The server can't reach the database.\n    *   **Deadlocks\n:** Multiple processes are waiting for each other to release a database lock.\n    *   **Query Errors:** A mal\nformed SQL query or a query that violates a database constraint.\n*   **Third-Party Service Failures:** If\n your API relies on other services, a failure or timeout in one of those services can cascade and cause a 500 error in\n your API.\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:**\n    *   **Memory Leaks:** A bug in your\n code that causes it to consume more and more memory over time, eventually leading to a crash.\n    *   **CPU\n Spikes:** An inefficient algorithm or a sudden surge in traffic can max out the CPU, causing requests to fail.\n*   \n**Configuration Errors:** Incorrect database credentials, invalid API keys for third-party services, or other misconfigurations can lead to \n500 errors.\n*   **Bugs in the Code:** A good old-fashioned bug in the application logic can lead\n to an unhandled exception.\n\n### How to Debug 500 Errors in 2026:\n\n\nDebugging 500 errors in 2026 will involve a combination of modern tools and best practices. Here\n's a recommended approach:\n\n1.  **Centralized Logging:** Use a centralized logging platform like **Datadog,\n Splunk, or the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**. This will allow you to\n search and analyze logs from all your services in one place. Your logs should include:\n    *   A unique request\n ID to trace a request as it travels through your system.\n    *   The full stack trace of the exception.\n    \n*   The request and response bodies (be sure to sanitize any sensitive data).\n2.  **Application Performance Monitoring (APM\n):** APM tools like **New Relic, Dynatrace, or AppDynamics** can help you pinpoint the\n source of the error. They can provide detailed performance metrics, distributed tracing, and code-level visibility.\n3.  \n**Error Tracking:** Services like **Sentry, Bugsnag, or Rollbar** can automatically capture and report un\nhandled exceptions. They can group similar errors, provide context about the request, and alert you when a new error is detected\n.\n4.  **Reproduce the Error:** Use a tool like **Postman or Insomnia** to reproduce\n the error in a controlled environment. This will allow you to inspect the request and response and test different scenarios.\n5.\n  **Code Analysis:** Use a static code analysis tool to identify potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in your code.\n6.\n  **Health Checks:** Implement a `/health` endpoint in your API that checks the status of your dependencies (database, third\n-party services, etc.). This can help you quickly identify the source of the problem.\n7.  **Distributed\n Tracing:** In a microservices architecture, a single request can travel through multiple services. Distributed tracing tools like **Jaeger or\n Zipkin** can help you trace the path of a request and identify the service that is causing the error.","hint":"A good answer should explain that HTTP 500 errors on REST API customer endpoints usually stem from server-side problems such as unhandled exceptions, backend dependency failures (e.g., database or third-party services), misconfigurations, or resource limits, and distinguish them from 4xx client errors as “unexpected server conditions.”[[1, 2, 3, 4]] It must also outline concrete 2026-relevant debugging practices—such as examining server and backend logs, enabling debug/trace in the API stack or gateway, using centralized logging and correlation IDs, reproducing the failing request in a controlled environment, and monitoring/alerting around 5xx rates—to systematically identify root causes and validate fixes.[[5, 6, 7, 8]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?","timestamp":25830},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":25830},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770547853866-a094f2f7c1332","status":"completed","timestamp":25830},{"type":"message","content":"###","timestamp":25830},{"type":"message","content":" Common Causes of 500 Errors in REST API Customer Endpoints and How to Debug","timestamp":25830},{"type":"message","content":" Them in 2026\n\nA 500 Internal Server Error is a generic HTTP status code that indicates an","timestamp":25830},{"type":"message","content":" unexpected condition on the server that prevented it from fulfilling a request.

{"id":"websearch-1092","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix VS Code not opening markdown md files 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix VS Code not opening markdown md files 2026\nIf you'\nre having trouble opening or viewing Markdown (`.md`) files in VS Code, here are several troubleshooting steps you can take\n, starting with the most common and easiest solutions.\n\n### 1. Use the Correct Command to Open the Preview\n\n\nSometimes, the issue is not that the file isn't opening, but that the preview isn't being displayed. You\n can open the Markdown preview in a few ways:\n\n*   **Command Palette:**\n    1.  Open a\n Markdown file.\n    2.  Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P\n` on Mac) to open the Command Palette.\n    3.  Type `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side` and\n press `Enter`.\n\n*   **Keyboard Shortcut:**\n    *   Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (or \n`Cmd+Shift+V` on Mac) to open the preview in a new tab.\n    *   Press `Ctrl+K\n V` (or `Cmd+K V` on Mac) to open the preview in a split view to the side.\n\n\n*   **Right-Click:**\n    *   Right-click on the `.md` file in the Explorer pane\n and select `Open Preview`.\n\n### 2. Check for Extension Conflicts\n\nExtensions are a common source of issues in VS Code.\n\n\n*   **Disable Extensions:** The most reliable way to check for an extension conflict is to disable all of them and see\n if the problem persists.\n    1.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+\nShift+P`).\n    2.  Run the `Developer: Reload With Extensions Disabled` command.\n    3.  \nTry to open a Markdown file and its preview again. If it works, then an extension is the culprit.\n\n*   \n**Identify the Problematic Extension:** If disabling extensions works, you can identify the problematic one by re-enabling your\n extensions one by one until the issue reappears. Some extensions that have been known to cause issues with Markdown files include:\n    *\n   GitHub Copilot (you may need to sign in or disable it).\n    *   Other Markdown-related extensions that\n might override the built-in previewer.\n\n### 3. Verify the Language Mode\n\nVS Code might not be recognizing\n your file as a Markdown file.\n\n1.  Open your `.md` file.\n2.  Look at the bottom-\nright corner of the VS Code window. It should say \"Markdown\".\n3.  If it says something else,\n click on it and select \"Markdown\" from the list of languages.\n\nThis can sometimes happen with complex filenames like `my\n-file.v2.md`.\n\n### 4. Reset Editor Associations\n\nYou can explicitly tell VS Code to\n use the built-in Markdown previewer for `.md` files in your `settings.json` file:\n\n1\n.  Open your `settings.json` file (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,` and then click the \"Open\n Settings (JSON)\" icon in the top right).\n2.  Add or update the following setting:\n\n\n```json\n\"workbench\n.editorAssociations\": {\n    \"*.md\": \"default\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\nOr, if you want\n to always open the preview by default:\n\n\n```json\n\"workbench.editorAssociations\": {\n    \"*.md\": \"\nvscode.markdown.preview.editor\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 5. Clear and Reinstall\n\nIf all\n else fails, you can try clearing your VS Code cache and settings, or reinstalling VS Code.\n\n*   **Clear\n Cache:** The location of the cache directory depends on your operating system. You can search for instructions on how to clear the VS Code cache\n for your specific OS.\n*   **Reinstall VS Code:** If the issue persists, a fresh installation of VS Code\n might be necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of VS Code not opening Markdown\n files.

Create a new Turborepo project\n\nFirst, create a new Turborepo project using the following\n command:\n\n\n```bash\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n```\n\n\n### 2. Set up the `ui\n` package\n\nNext, you need to set up the `ui` package, which will house the shadcn UI components.\n To do this, first, `cd` into the `packages/ui` directory:\n\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\n\n\n```\n\n\nNext, install the required dependencies:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer class\n-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS\n\n\nNext, you need to configure Tailwind CSS. First, run the following command to create the necessary configuration files:\n\n\n```bash\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n```\n\n\nThis will create `tailwind.config.js` and\n `postcss.config.js` files.\n\nNext, add the following code to the `packages/ui/postcss\n.config.js` file:\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss\n: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n};\n\n```\n\n\nNext, add the following code to the `packages\n/ui/tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\"./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}\", \"../../apps/**/*.{\nts,tsx,js,jsx}\"],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  \nplugins: [require(\"tailwindcss-animate\")],\n};\n\n```\n\n\nNext, create a `globals.css` file\n in `packages/ui/src/styles` and add the following code:\n\n\n```css\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind\n components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Initialize shadcn UI\n\nNext, you need to initialize shad\ncn UI by running the following command in the `packages/ui` directory:\n\n\n```bash\nnpx shadcn-\nui@latest init\n\n```\n\n\nYou will be prompted to make a few selections. It is recommended to use the following selections\n:\n\n\n```\nWould you like to use TypeScript? yes\nWhich style would you like to use? › New York\nWhich\n color would you like to use as base color? › Slate\nWhere is your global CSS file? › src/styles\n/globals.css\nWould you like to use CSS variables for colors? › yes\nWhere is your tailwind.config.\njs located? › tailwind.config.js\nConfigure the import alias for components: › @/components\nConfigure\n the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils\nAre you using React Server Components? › yes\n\n```\n\n\nThis\n will create a `components.json` file in the `packages/ui` directory.\n\n### 5. Add a\n `cn` utility file\n\nNext, you need to create a `cn` utility file to merge Tailwind classes. To\n do this, create a `utils.ts` file in `packages/ui/src/lib` and add the following\n code:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { tw\nMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(cls\nx(inputs));\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 6. Add shadcn UI components\n\nNow, you can add\n shadcn UI components to your `ui` package. To do this, `cd` into the `apps/web\n` directory and run the following command:\n\n\n```bash\nnpx shadcn-ui@latest add button\n```\n\n\nThis\n will add the `button` component to the `packages/ui/src/components/ui` directory.\n\n### 7\n. Use the shared components in the application\n\nTo use the shared shadcn UI components in your application, you need to import\n the global CSS file and the components.\n\nFirst, import the global CSS file in `apps/web/app/globals\n.css`:\n\n\n```css\n@import \"@repo/ui/src/styles/globals.css\";\n```\n\n\nNext,\n import the `button` component in `apps/web/app/page.tsx`:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button\n } from \"@repo/ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    \n<div>\n      <Button>Click Me</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 8. (\nOptional) Configure a build process for the `ui` package\n\nYou can also configure a build process for the `ui\n` package. This will pre-build the `ui` package, which can improve build times.\n\nTo do this, first,\n install `tsup`:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n\nNext, create a `ts\nup.config.ts` file in `packages/ui` and add the following code:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.\nts\", \"src/styles/globals.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true\n,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/ts\nup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n\n```\n\n\nFinally, update the `packages/ui/package.json` file to add the `build` script and the\n `exports` field:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\n\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"./dist/tsup/index.js\",\n  \"\nmodule\": \"./dist/tsup/index.mjs\",\n  \"types\": \"./dist/tsup/index.\nd.ts\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \".\": {\n      \"import\": \"./dist/ts\nup/index.mjs\",\n      \"require\": \"./dist/tsup/index.js\",\n      \n\"types\": \"./dist/tsup/index.d.ts\"\n    },\n    \"./components/*\": {\n      \n\"import\": \"./dist/tsup/components/*.mjs\",\n      \"require\": \"./dist/tsup/components/*.\njs\",\n      \"types\": \"./dist/tsup/components/*.d.ts\"\n    },\n    \n\"./styles/*\": {\n      \"import\": \"./dist/tsup/styles/*.mjs\",\n      \"\nrequire\": \"./dist/tsup/styles/*.js\",\n      \"types\": \"./dist/tsup/styles\n/*.d.ts\"\n    },\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./dist/tsup/styles/globals.css\n\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsup\",\n    \"dev\":\n \"tsup --watch\",\n    \"lint\": \"eslint . --max-warnings 0\",\n    \"generate:\ncomponent\": \"npx shadcn-ui@latest add\"\n  }\n}\n\n```","hint":"A correct answer must explain how to initialize and configure shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo, including using the shadcn CLI with monorepo support, creating or using a shared `ui` (or similar) package, wiring Tailwind CSS/config so the shared components work across apps, and importing/using those components from individual app workspaces.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":44668},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":44668},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770548220230-21fcc5c562a6","status":"completed","timestamp":44668},{"type":"message","content":"Here is a tutorial on how to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo","timestamp":44668},{"type":"message","content":":\n\n### 1.

It runs locally on your machine, ensuring your meeting data remains secure and under\n your control.\n\nHere's how to set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server in 202\n6:\n\n### **1. Prerequisites**\n\n*   **MeetGeek Account:** You need an active MeetGeek\n account.\n*   **MeetGeek API Key:** You'll need to obtain an API key from your MeetGe\nek account settings.\n*   **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node\n Package Manager) installed on your computer.\n\n### **2. Setup**\n\n1.  **Download the Server:**\n    *\n   Clone the official MeetGeek MCP server repository from GitHub using the following command:\n        \n```bash\n        git clone https\n://github.com/meetgeekai/meetgeek-mcp-server.git\n        \n```\n\n\n2.\n  **Install Dependencies:**\n    *   Navigate to the downloaded directory:\n        \n```bash\n        cd meetgeek-m\ncp-server\n        \n```\n\n    *   Install the necessary Node.js packages:\n        \n```bash\n        npm install\n\n        \n```\n\n\n3.  **Configure the Server:**\n    *   The server is configured using environment variables. You\n can create a `.env` file in the `meetgeek-mcp-server` directory and add your MeetGeek API key\n:\n        \n```\n        MEETGEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n        \n```\n\n    *   Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly in your terminal.\n\n4.  **Start the Server\n:**\n    *   Run the following command to start the server:\n        \n```bash\n        npm start\n        \n```\n\n    *   The server will start locally and listen for connections from MCP-compatible AI tools.\n\n### **3. Usage\n**\n\nOnce the server is running, you can connect it to your favorite MCP-compatible AI tools, such as Claude\n, Cursor, or LobeChat.\n\n*   **Add the MCP Server to Your AI Tool:** In your AI\n tool's settings, you'll need to add the local MCP server as a data source. The specific steps will vary\n depending on the tool, but you will typically need to provide the server's local address (e.g., \n`http://localhost:3000`).\n*   **Access Your Meeting Data:** After connecting, your AI tool will\n be able to access your MeetGeek meeting data, including:\n    *   Transcripts\n    *   Summaries\n\n    *   Action items\n    *   Highlights\n\nYou can then use your AI assistant to perform tasks like summarizing meetings\n, creating follow-up actions, and analyzing meeting content.\n\n### **Cloud Option**\n\nFor users who prefer not to run\n the server locally, MeetGeek also offers a public cloud-hosted MCP server that uses OAuth for authentication. This provides\n a secure way to connect your AI tools to your meeting data without requiring a local setup.

Here is a guide on how to build a full-width, responsive image slider using the Next.js Image component and Swiper\n in 2026.\n\n### 1. Install Dependencies\n\nFirst, you'll need to add Swiper to your\n Next.js project:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n```\n\n\n### 2. Create the Slider Component\n\nCreate\n a new file, for example, `/components/ImageSlider.tsx`. This component must be a Client Component because it uses\n React hooks for state and interactivity.\n\n\n```tsx\n// components/ImageSlider.tsx\n'use client';\n\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay\n } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport\n 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport\n 'swiper/css/autoplay';\n\n\n// An array of image objects. \n// You can fetch this data from a CMS\n or API.\nconst images = [\n  { id: 1, src: '/images/slide-1.jpg',\n alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { id: 2, src: '/images/slide-2\n.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { id: 3, src: '/images/\nslide-3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nconst ImageSlider = () => {\n  \nreturn (\n    <Swiper\n      modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n      navigation\n      pagination={{\n clickable: true }}\n      autoplay={{ delay: 5000 }}\n      loop={true}\n      \nclassName=\"w-full\"\n    >\n      {images.map((image) => (\n        <SwiperSlide\n key={image.id}>\n          <div className=\"w-full h-96 relative\">\n            <Image\n\n              src={image.src}\n              alt={image.alt}\n              fill\n              style={{ objectFit: 'cover\n' }}\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width:\n 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </Sw\niperSlide>\n      ))}\n    </Swiper>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ImageSlider;\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Add Component to Your Page\n\nNow you can use the `ImageSlider` component in any\n of your pages.\n\n\n```tsx\n// app/page.tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider\n';\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <h1 className=\"text\n-4xl text-center my-8\">\n        Full-Width Responsive Image Slider\n      </h1>\n      <ImageSlider\n />\n      <div className=\"mt-8\">\n        {/* Other page content */}\n      </div>\n    </main>\n\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n*   **`'use client';`**: This directive\n is essential. Swiper relies on browser-specific APIs and React hooks, so it must be rendered on the client side.\n\n*   **Importing Swiper CSS**: You must import the CSS files for the core Swiper functionality and any\n modules you use (like Navigation and Pagination) for them to be styled correctly.\n*   **Next.js Image Component\n (`<Image>`)**:\n    *   **`fill`**: This prop makes the image expand to fill its\n parent container. This is the key to making the image responsive within the Swiper slide.\n    *   **`style={{ object\nFit: 'cover' }}`**: This ensures the image covers the entire area of its container, cropping it if necessary without\n distorting the aspect ratio.\n    *   **`sizes`**: This prop is crucial for performance. It tells the\n browser which image size to download based on the viewport width, preventing mobile devices from downloading unnecessarily large desktop-sized images.\n*\n   **Parent Container**: For the `fill` prop to work on the `<Image>` component, its parent element (\nin this case, the `<div>` inside `<SwiperSlide>`) must have `position: relative` and a defined\n size (e.g., `h-96`).\n*   **Swiper Configuration**:\n    *   **\n`modules`**: We explicitly import and pass the `Navigation`, `Pagination`, and `Autoplay` modules to enable those\n features.\n    *   **`navigation`**: This prop adds the next/previous navigation arrows.\n    *   **\n`pagination={{ clickable: true }}`**: This adds the small indicator dots and allows users to click them to navigate.\n    *   \n**`loop={true}`**: Creates an infinite loop for the slider.","hint":"A correct answer should describe using Swiper’s React integration with Next.js in a client component (`'use client'`), importing `Swiper`/`SwiperSlide` and Swiper CSS, and rendering slides that use the Next.js `Image` component (typically with `fill`/responsive layout and parent with relative positioning) to achieve a full-width, responsive slider; it should also mention configuring Swiper options (e.g., breakpoints or `slidesPerView`, navigation/pagination) so the slider adapts to different screen sizes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":28067},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":28067},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770548377346-66e184e2d0427","status":"completed","timestamp":28067},{"type":"message","content":"Of course","timestamp":28067},{"type":"message","content":".

No further tools are needed.\n\nBased on my research, here'\ns how you can use SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models in 2025:\n\n### Introduction\n: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of multilingual models, it's important to understand the three core concepts at\n play:\n\n*   **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs):** SAEs are a type of neural network that are\n used to extract meaningful features from the internal representations of a language model. They are trained to reconstruct the model's activations from\n a sparse set of features, which forces them to learn a compressed and disentangled representation of the model's knowledge.\n*   \n**Feature Steering:** Once an SAE has been trained, its features can be used to steer the behavior of the language model\n. By amplifying or suppressing the activation of a specific feature, you can encourage or discourage the model from generating text that is related to that\n feature.\n*   **Mechanistic Interpretability:** Mechanistic interpretability is a field of research that aims to understand the internal\n workings of language models. By using techniques like SAEs and feature steering, researchers can gain insights into how models represent and\n process information.\n\n### State of the Art in 2025\n\nBy 2025, the use\n of SAEs for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models is a rapidly growing field of research. Here are some of the key\n findings and applications that have emerged:\n\n*   **Controlling Language Output:** Researchers have shown that SAEs can be used\n to control the output language of multilingual models. By identifying features that correspond to specific languages, they can steer the model to\n generate text in a desired language, even without providing any explicit language prompts.\n*   **Understanding Cross-Lingual Representations\n:** SAEs are being used to understand how multilingual models represent different languages. By analyzing the features that are activated by text\n in different languages, researchers can gain insights into the similarities and differences in how the model processes those languages.\n*   **Improving\n Cross-Lingual Transfer:** By identifying and steering features that are shared across languages, researchers are exploring ways to improve the\n cross-lingual transfer of knowledge in multilingual models. This can help to improve the performance of models on low-resource languages.\n\n\n### How to Use SAE Feature Steering in Multilingual Models\n\nHere is a hypothetical workflow for how you could use SAE feature steering\n for mechanistic interpretability in a multilingual model in 2025:\n\n1.  **Train an SAE:**\n The first step is to train an SAE on the activations of a multilingual language model. You will need a large and diverse dataset of text\n in multiple languages to train the SAE effectively.\n2.  **Identify Multilingual Features:** Once the SAE is trained, you can\n use it to identify features that are specific to certain languages or that are shared across languages. You can do this by analyzing the\n feature activations for text in different languages.\n3.  **Steer the Model:** Once you have identified the features\n of interest, you can use them to steer the behavior of the model. For example, you could amplify the activation of a\n feature that corresponds to a specific language to encourage the model to generate text in that language.\n4.  **Analyze the Results\n:** The final step is to analyze the results of your steering experiments. By observing how the model's behavior changes when\n you steer different features, you can gain insights into the model's internal workings.\n\n### Challenges and Future Directions\n\n\nDespite the promising results, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed in this field:\n\n*   \n**Scalability:** Training SAEs on large language models can be computationally expensive. Researchers are exploring new techniques to improve the scalability\n of SAE training.\n*   **Evaluation:** Evaluating the interpretability of SAE features is a subjective and challenging task. Researchers\n are working on developing more objective and reliable methods for evaluating interpretability.\n*   **Multimodality:** As language models become increasingly\n multimodal, researchers will need to develop new techniques for interpreting and steering their behavior.\n\nIn the future, we can expect to see\n continued progress in the use of SAEs for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models. As these techniques become more sophisticated, they\n will play an increasingly important role in our ability to understand, control, and improve the behavior of these powerful models.I\n have completed my research and synthesized the information into a comprehensive answer.

Instead, run\n your application directly. If you need to specify a working directory, do it in your `Dockerfile`.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n\n1.  Go to your service settings in your Railway project.\n2.  Find the **Start Command** field.\n\n3.  Remove any `cd` commands.\n\nFor example, if your code is in a subdirectory named `myapp\n`, your start command should be:\n\n\n```bash\n# Correct Start Command\npython myapp/main.py\n```\n\n\n\n### 2. Use `WORKDIR` in your Dockerfile\n\nIf you are using a Dockerfile, the best practice is to set\n the working directory with the `WORKDIR` instruction. This avoids the need to `cd` into a directory in your start\n command.\n\n**Example `Dockerfile`:**\n\n\n```dockerfile\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\n\n\nFROM python:3.10-slim\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n#\n Copy the rest of your application's code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Install any dependencies\nRUN pip install -r requirements.\ntxt\n\n# Your start command (as the last instruction)\n# This will be executed inside the /app directory\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\n\n```\n\n\nWith this `Dockerfile`, you can often leave the **Start Command** in\n Railway's settings blank, as it will use the `CMD` from the Dockerfile.\n\n### 3.\n Use `sh -c` for Complex Commands\n\nIf you absolutely must run multiple commands, use `sh -c\n` to execute them within a shell context.\n\n**In Railway Start Command:**\n\n\n```bash\nsh -c \"cd\n myapp && python main.py\"\n\n```\n\n\n**In a `Dockerfile`:**\n\n\n```dockerfile\nCMD\n [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"cd myapp && python main.py\"]\n\n```\n\n\nHowever, using `WORKDIR\n` is the cleaner and more idiomatic Docker approach.\n\nBy ensuring that `cd` is not the first command in your\n startup instruction, you will resolve the \"cd could not be found\" error.","hint":"A correct answer must explain that the error occurs because Railway is trying to run `cd` as the container’s start executable (from the Start Command or Dockerfile `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`), and must state that the fix is to change that start command so the executable is a real binary (e.g., `node`, `python`, etc.) and any directory changes or shell logic are handled via a proper shell invocation (like `/bin/sh -c \"cd … && <command>\"`) or removed.[[1, 2, 3]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I fix the \"cd could not be found\" error when a Railway container fails to start in 2026?","timestamp":23175},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":23175},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770548606666-afb69ff4b583b8","status":"completed","timestamp":23175},{"type":"message","content":"The \"cd could not be found\" error in a","timestamp":23175},{"type":"message","content":" Railway container occurs because `cd` is a shell built-in command, not a standalone executable.

{"id":"websearch-1470","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026\nIn 2026, handling `onClick` interactions for checkboxes and labels in React still relies on foundational\n, accessibility-first principles, but is often abstracted and simplified by modern component libraries.\n\nHere is the best-practice approach,\n from the fundamental to the use of libraries.\n\n### 1. The Best Practice: `htmlFor` and Controlled\n Components\n\nThe most robust and accessible method is to use a controlled component with a standard HTML `<label>` and its \n`htmlFor` attribute. This approach requires no direct `onClick` handler on the label itself, as the browser handles the connection\n between the label and the input natively.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   **Controlled Component**: The state of the checkbox is\n managed by React using `useState`.\n*   **`htmlFor` and `id`**: The `htmlFor` attribute on\n the `<label>` is linked to the `id` of the `<input>`. This is crucial for accessibility and makes the label\n \"clickable.\" In JSX, you use `htmlFor` instead of `for`.\n*   **`onChange\n` on the input**: This is the correct event to handle state changes, as it covers clicks, keyboard interactions (like the space\nbar), and other input methods.\n\n**Example:**\n\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction\n StandardCheckbox() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleChange = (\nevent) => {\n    // The event target's 'checked' property will be a boolean\n    setIsChecked(event\n.target.checked);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"form-control\">\n      {\n/* The htmlFor attribute on the label points to the input's id */}\n      <label htmlFor=\"terms-checkbox\">\n\n        I agree to the terms and conditions\n      </label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        id=\"\nterms-checkbox\"\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={handleChange}\n      />\n      <p>\nChecked: {isChecked ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nexport default StandardCheckbox;\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Handling Clicks on Custom Components (When not to use a\n label)\n\nIf you wrap your `input` in a `div` or other element and want the entire element to be clickable,\n you might be tempted to use `onClick`.\n\n**Example with `onClick` and event handling:**\nIn this case, you\n would add an `onClick` to the wrapper `div` and also handle the `onChange` on the checkbox to prevent conflicts\n and support keyboard accessibility.\n\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction CustomClickableCheckbox() {\n\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  // This toggles the state\n  const handleContainer\nClick = () => {\n    setIsChecked(prev => !prev);\n  };\n\n  // This keeps the input\n in sync and prevents the click from bubbling\n  const handleCheckboxChange = (event) => {\n    // Stop\n the click event from firing the container's onClick as well\n    event.stopPropagation();\n    setIsChecked(event.target.\nchecked);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      onClick={handleContainerClick}\n      style={{\n\n        padding: '10px',\n        border: '1px solid #ccc',\n        cursor: '\npointer',\n        display: 'inline-block'\n      }}\n    >\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={handleCheckboxChange}\n        // Add aria-label for screen readers since\n there's no <label>\n        aria-label=\"Agreement checkbox\"\n      />\n      <span>I agree to everything\n</span>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n**Caution**: This pattern is less accessible than using a semantic\n `<label>` and should be used sparingly.\n\n### 3. Modern Approach: Using Component Libraries\n\nIn 202\n6, most developers will leverage a UI component library to ensure accessibility, consistency, and efficiency. These libraries handle the label\n-input association for you.\n\n**Example with Material-UI (MUI):**\n\nMUI's `FormControlLabel\n` is a high-level component that elegantly wraps a `Checkbox` and its label.\n\n\n```jsx\nimport {\n useState } from 'react';\nimport Checkbox from '@mui/material/Checkbox';\nimport FormControlLabel from '@\nmui/material/FormControlLabel';\n\nfunction MuiCheckbox() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(\nfalse);\n\n  const handleChange = (event) => {\n    setIsChecked(event.target.checked);\n\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <FormControlLabel\n      label=\"I agree to the MUI terms\"\n      \ncontrol={\n        <Checkbox\n          checked={isChecked}\n          onChange={handleChange}\n        />\n      }\n    \n/>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Example with Headless UI (like Radix or Headless UI):\n**\n\nHeadless libraries provide the functionality and accessibility hooks without the styling, giving you full design control.\n\n\n```jsx\n//\n Example using Radix UI Primitives\nimport * as Checkbox from '@radix-ui/react-checkbox';\n\nimport { CheckIcon } from '@radix-ui/react-icons';\n\nconst RadixCheckbox = () => (\n\n  <form>\n    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n      <Checkbox\n.Root className=\"CheckboxRoot\" defaultChecked id=\"c1\">\n        <Checkbox.Indicator className=\"CheckboxIndicator\">\n\n          <CheckIcon />\n        </Checkbox.Indicator>\n      </Checkbox.Root>\n      <label\n className=\"Label\" htmlFor=\"c1\">\n        Accept terms and conditions.\n      </label>\n    </div>\n\n  </form>\n);\n\n```\n\n\n### Summary of Best Practices for 2026:\n\n1\n.  **Prioritize `htmlFor`**: Always use `<label htmlFor=\"inputId\">` for native, accessible behavior\n.\n2.  **Use Controlled Components**: Manage checkbox state in React with `useState`.\n3.  **\nHandle `onChange` on the `<input>`**: This is the correct event for capturing all user interactions that change the value\n. Avoid `onClick` on the `<label>`.\n4.  **Leverage UI Libraries**: For any application\n of moderate complexity, use libraries like Material-UI, Radix UI, or Headless UI to get accessibility and functionality\n for free.","hint":"A strong answer should explain that in modern React you normally handle checkbox interaction with a controlled component using the `checked` prop and `onChange` (not `onClick`) on the `<input type=\"checkbox\">`, and use a `<label>` correctly associated via `htmlFor`/`id` (or wrapping the input) so clicks on the label toggle the checkbox while preserving keyboard and screen‑reader accessibility.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","timestamp":34466},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":34466},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770548669954-1676a68f186068","status":"completed","timestamp":34466},{"type":"message","content":"In 2026, handling `onClick` interactions for checkboxes and labels in React still relies on foundational","timestamp":34466},{"type":"message","content":", accessibility-first principles, but is often abstracted and simplified by modern component libraries.\n\nHere is the best-practice approach,","timestamp":34466},{"type":"message","content":" from the fundamental to the use of libraries.\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1548","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024\nLoad\nLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing is a sophisticated process injection technique that combines elements of DLL hollowing and module stomping to\n execute malicious code within the address space of a legitimate process. This method is designed to evade detection by security products by masquer\nading the malicious code within a seemingly legitimate, loaded DLL.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the technique works,\n integrating concepts from the search results:\n\n### Core Concepts:\n\n*   **Process Hollowing:** This is a technique where a legitimate\n process is created in a suspended state. The memory of this process is then \"hollowed out\" (unmapped) and\n replaced with malicious code. When the process is resumed, it executes the malicious code instead of its own.\n*   **DLL\n Injection:** A common method of process injection where a malicious DLL is forced to load into a target process. The classic approach\n uses `CreateRemoteThread` in conjunction with `LoadLibrary` to load the DLL.\n*   **Module St\nomping/Overloading:** This is a more advanced technique where a legitimate DLL is loaded into a process, but its memory is\n then overwritten with malicious code. This is also referred to as DLL Hollowing. From the perspective of the process's module\n list, the legitimate DLL appears to be loaded, but the code executing is malicious.\n\n### The \"LoadLibraryEx Decoy\n\" Method:\n\nThis technique leverages `LoadLibraryEx` for its ability to load DLLs with more control compared to the\n standard `LoadLibrary`. The \"decoy\" aspect comes from using a legitimate DLL as a placeholder, which is then hollow\ned out and replaced with malicious code.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1.\n  **Target Process Selection:** The attacker first identifies a target process for injection. This could be a common system process like \n`svchost.exe` or `explorer.exe` to blend in with normal system activity.\n\n2.  **Dec\noy DLL Selection:** A legitimate DLL that is typically loaded by the target process, or one that would not arouse suspicion if\n loaded, is chosen as the \"decoy.\"\n\n3.  **Loading the Decoy DLL with `LoadLibraryEx\n`:** The attacker uses `LoadLibraryExW` with the `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` and\n `LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE` flags. This is a critical step for a few reasons:\n    *   \n`LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE`: This flag loads the DLL as a data file, meaning the system doesn't\n perform the usual initializations or prepare it for execution. This makes it easier to manipulate the memory.\n    *   \n`DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES`: This flag prevents the loader from resolving the DLL's dependencies, which can reduce\n the footprint of the loading process and avoid potential crashes if the DLL's dependencies aren't present.\n\n4.\n  **Memory Hollowing:** Once the decoy DLL is mapped into the target process's memory space, the attacker un\nmaps the original code of the DLL using `NtUnmapViewOfSection` or a similar function.\n\n5.  **\nAllocating New Memory:** The attacker then allocates a new region of memory at the same base address as the unmapped decoy\n DLL, using `VirtualAllocEx` with `MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE` and `PAGE_EXECUTE\n_READWRITE` permissions.\n\n6.  **Writing the Malicious Payload:** The malicious code (the \"real\n\" DLL or shellcode) is then written into this newly allocated memory region using `WriteProcessMemory`.\n\n7.  **Fix\ning PE Header and Relocations:** The attacker manually performs the necessary relocations for the malicious code to execute correctly from\n its new memory location. This involves parsing the PE header of the malicious DLL and adjusting addresses.\n\n8.  **Execution\n:** The attacker then needs a way to execute the malicious code. This can be done in several ways:\n    *   \n**`CreateRemoteThread`:** A new thread is created in the target process, with its entry point set to the address\n of the malicious code.\n    *   **Thread Execution Hijacking:** An existing thread in the target process is hijacked, and its\n instruction pointer is redirected to the malicious code.\n\n### Why this technique is effective in 2024:\n\n\n*   **Evasion of Module-Based Detection:** Security software that monitors loaded modules will see the legitimate \"decoy\" DLL\n in the process's module list. This makes it harder to spot the malicious activity, as the process appears to have\n loaded a legitimate library.\n*   **Bypassing Basic Heuristics:** Traditional DLL injection often leaves a clear trail\n (e.g., a call to `LoadLibrary` followed by `CreateRemoteThread`). The use of `Load\nLibraryEx` with specific flags, combined with the hollowing process, is a less common and more sophisticated pattern that may\n not be flagged by all security products.\n*   **In-Memory Execution:** The malicious code resides entirely in memory\n, with no corresponding malicious file on disk, making it a form of fileless malware.\n\nIn summary, the Load\nLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing technique is a stealthy and advanced method of process injection that leverages legitimate system functionality to hide\n malicious code within the memory space of a trusted process. It represents the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders in\n the realm of endpoint security.","hint":"A good answer must explain that this is a decoy DLL / DLL hollowing or module-stomping style injection that uses LoadLibraryEx to load a benign DLL into a remote or current process, then overwrites or “hollows out” the loaded image’s code (e.g., at its entry point) in memory with malicious payload, and finally transfers execution to that payload to evade detection.

{"id":"websearch-1594","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?\nBased on\n the latest documentation and trends for 2026, here are some examples of Cloudflare Workers AI binding usage patterns:\n\n###\n 1. Generative AI and Content Creation\nOne of the most common use cases is to leverage Large Language Models (LL\nMs) for generative AI tasks. You can use Workers AI bindings to build applications that generate text, translate languages, and create\n different kinds of creative content.\n\n**Example:**\nA Worker that uses the `@cf/meta/llama-2\n-7b-chat-int8` model to power a chatbot on your website. The Worker can be triggered by a user'\ns message, and it will use the Workers AI binding to send the message to the Llama model and return the response\n to the user.\n\n\n```typescript\n// src/index.ts\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request:\n Request, env: Env) {\n    const { prompt } = await request.json();\n    const response = await env\n.AI.run(\n      \"@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8\",\n\n      { prompt }\n    );\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));\n  },\n};\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Image and Vision Applications\nWorkers AI provides access to models that can analyze and process images. You can\n use these models for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation.\n\n**Example:**\nAn e-commerce application\n that uses the `@cf/microsoft/resnet-50` model to automatically tag product images with relevant keywords. When\n a new product image is uploaded, a Worker can use the Workers AI binding to send the image to the ResNet-50\n model and store the returned tags in a database.\n\n\n```typescript\n// src/index.ts\nexport default {\n\n  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {\n    const { image } = await request.json();\n\n    const response = await env.AI.run(\n      \"@cf/microsoft/resnet-50\",\n\n      { image }\n    );\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));\n  },\n};\n\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nBy using embedding models, you can\n build powerful semantic search applications. These models convert text into vector embeddings, which can be used to find similar pieces of text. This\n is particularly useful for building RAG systems, where you retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and use them to augment the prompt\n of an LLM.\n\n**Example:**\nA documentation website that uses the `@cf/baai/bge-base\n-en-v1.5` model to help users find relevant articles. When a user enters a search query,\n a Worker uses the Workers AI binding to generate an embedding for the query. It then compares this embedding to the embeddings of all\n the articles in the knowledge base to find the most relevant ones.\n\n\n```typescript\n// src/index.ts\nexport default {\n\n  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {\n    const { text } = await request.json();\n\n    const response = await env.AI.run(\n      \"@cf/baai/bge-base-en\n-v1.5\",\n      { text }\n    );\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(\nresponse));\n  },\n};\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Audio and Speech Recognition\nWorkers AI also supports audio\n and speech recognition models, which can be used to transcribe audio files, identify speakers, and translate speech.\n\n**Example\n:**\nA podcast hosting platform that uses the `@cf/openai/whisper` model to automatically generate transcripts for new\n episodes. When a new episode is uploaded, a Worker can use the Workers AI binding to send the audio file to the\n Whisper model and save the transcript to a database.\n\n\n```typescript\n// src/index.ts\nexport default {\n\n  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {\n    const { audio } = await request.\njson();\n    const response = await env.AI.run(\n      \"@cf/openai/whisper\",\n\n      { audio }\n    );\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));\n  },\n\n};\n\n```\n\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many ways you can use Cloudflare Workers AI bindings to build powerful and intelligent\n applications. By leveraging the serverless architecture of Cloudflare Workers and the growing ecosystem of AI models, you can create innovative\n and scalable solutions for a wide range of use cases.","hint":"A good answer should recognize that the query is about Cloudflare Workers AI “AI bindings” and briefly describe concrete usage patterns for 2026, such as configuring `env.AI` in Wrangler, invoking models (e.g., LLMs, embeddings, image models) from Workers via the binding, and possibly integrating with AI Gateway or Batch API, rather than giving generic AI or unrelated worker examples.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","timestamp":22593},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":22593},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770549256209-968617404505a8","status":"completed","timestamp":22593},{"type":"message","content":"Based on","timestamp":22593},{"type":"message","content":" the latest documentation and trends for 2026, here are some examples of Cloudflare Workers AI binding usage patterns:\n\n###","timestamp":22593},{"type":"message","content":" 1.

Here are the primary methods:\n\n### 1. Use a Community Plugin (Easiest Method)\n\nThere\n are several plugins available in the Figma Community that are designed for this purpose. This is the most straightforward approach and doesn't require\n any coding.\n\n*   **JSONtoNodeGenerator**: This plugin is specifically designed to convert JSON data into visual designs in Figma.\n\n*   **JSON to Figma**: This plugin allows you to populate layers with data from a JSON file. You can use it to\n map JSON fields to text and image layers.\n\n**General steps for using these plugins:**\n\n1.  **Install the plugin\n**: Search for the desired plugin in the Figma Community and install it.\n2.  **Prepare your JSON**: Make\n sure your JSON file is well-structured. For plugins like \"JSON to Figma\", you will need to name your Figma\n layers to match the keys in your JSON file.\n3.  **Run the plugin**: Select the layers or a\n frame in your Figma file, run the plugin from the Figma menu, and then provide your JSON data (either by pasting it\n, uploading a file, or providing a URL).\n\n### 2. Create Your Own Figma Plugin (For Developers)\n\nIf you\n need more control and have specific requirements that existing plugins don't cover, you can create your own plugin. The Figma Plugin API provides\n the tools you need to do this.\n\n**Key API to use:**\n\n*   **`figma.createNodeFromJSX\nAsync`**: This is a powerful and modern way to create nodes. You can define your node structure using JSX (similar\n to React), which makes it very expressive. You would parse your JSON data and then dynamically generate the JSX to create the\n Figma nodes.\n\n**Steps to create a custom plugin:**\n\n1.  **Set up your development environment**: This will\n involve setting up a project with TypeScript and configuring your `tsconfig.json` to handle JSX.\n2.  **Read\n and parse the JSON**: You can add a UI to your plugin to allow the user to input JSON data, or you can have\n it read from a file.\n3.  **Generate nodes**: Use the parsed JSON data to generate the node structure.\n You can use a combination of `figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync` and other API methods to create different types\n of nodes (e.g., `figma.createRectangle()`, `figma.createText()`).\n4.  \n**Build and test your plugin**: Run the plugin in Figma's developer mode to test it.\n\nThis approach gives\n you the most flexibility but requires knowledge of web development (specifically TypeScript and the Figma Plugin API).

This typically happens in\n CI/CD pipelines, when piping input or output, or in some terminal emulators.\n\nHere are a few ways to\n fix this, starting with the most common and recommended solution:\n\n### 1. Set the `CI` Environment Variable\n\nThe\n most straightforward solution is to set the `CI` environment variable to `true`. Most CI/CD platforms set this variable by\n default, but you can also set it manually. Ink and many other tools detect this variable and will automatically disable interactive features that require raw\n mode.\n\n\n```bash\nCI=true your-ink-cli-command\n```\n\n\n### 2. Program\nmatic Workaround\n\nIf you are using Ink programmatically in your own CLI tool, you can conditionally set raw mode based\n on whether the process is running in a TTY environment.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from\n 'react';\nimport { render, useInput } from 'ink';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  \nconst [key, setKey] = useState('');\n\n  useInput((input, key) => {\n    if\n (key) {\n      setKey(JSON.stringify(key));\n    }\n  });\n\n  return <>\nYou pressed: {key}</>;\n};\n\nif (process.stdin.isTTY) {\n  const {\n stdin } = process;\n  stdin.setRawMode(true);\n  stdin.resume();\n  stdin.set\nEncoding('utf8');\n  render(<MyComponent />);\n} else {\n  // Handle non-interactive mode\n\n  console.log('Non-interactive mode. Bypassing raw mode.');\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3\n. Check for Terminal Compatibility\n\nIn some cases, the terminal you are using may not fully support raw mode. If you are not\n in a CI/CD environment, try running your command in a different terminal emulator. Terminals like `xterm`, `gn\nome-terminal`, and `iTerm2` generally have good support for raw mode.\n\n### Why this happens\n\nInk\n uses raw mode to gain more control over the terminal, allowing it to do things like capture individual key presses (e.g., for\n interactive prompts) and render complex UI components. When you run an Ink application in a non-interactive environment, there is\n no TTY (teletypewriter) to control, which leads to the \"raw mode is not supported\" error.\n By setting `CI=true` or checking `process.stdin.isTTY`, you are signaling to Ink that it should\n not attempt to use these interactive features.","hint":"A good answer must explain that this Ink CLI error happens because “raw mode” input requires a real TTY (interactive terminal) and fails in non‑TTY contexts (like CI, pipes, or unsupported terminals), and should describe practical fixes such as running the command in a proper terminal, disabling or conditionally enabling raw mode (e.g., checking `process.stdin.isTTY` before `setRawMode`), or falling back to a non‑interactive mode when raw mode isn’t supported.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix raw mode is not supported error in Ink CLI 2026","timestamp":19786},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":19786},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770549547670-fd1dcbaf218d78","status":"completed","timestamp":19786},{"type":"message","content":"The","timestamp":19786},{"type":"message","content":" \"raw mode is not supported\" error in Ink-based command-line interfaces","timestamp":19786},{"type":"message","content":" is a common issue that arises when the CLI tool is run in an environment that doesn't support raw mode.

It provides a renderless cron editor with an Element Plus-styled component.\n\nHere's how you can integrate it into your Vue 3\n project with Vite:\n\n**1. Install the package:**\n\nUse npm or yarn to install the package:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install @vue-js-cron/element-plus\n# OR\nyarn add @vue-js-\ncron/element-plus\n\n```\n\n\n**2.

{"id":"websearch-1761","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026\nThe `ExtractedEntities` model in Graphiti is a Pydantic model\n that plays a crucial role in the entity extraction process. It serves as a structured container for the entities that the Language Model (\nLLM) extracts from a given text. This model ensures that the extracted data is validated and conforms to a predefined schema\n, which is essential for maintaining data integrity within the knowledge graph.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Pydantic BaseModel\n**: `ExtractedEntities` is a subclass of `pydantic.BaseModel`, which means it leverages Pydantic's\n data validation and serialization capabilities. This ensures that the data returned by the LLM is in the expected format.\n- **Entity\n Extraction**: When you pass a text document to Graphiti for processing, the framework uses an LLM to identify and classify\n entities within the text. The `ExtractedEntities` model is used as the response model for this operation, meaning the\n LLM's output is parsed into this model.\n- **Customizable Ontology**: Graphiti allows you to define a\n custom ontology, which is a set of entity and relationship types tailored to your specific domain. When you define your custom entity types\n, the LLM will attempt to classify the extracted entities according to your ontology.\n\n### How to Use `ExtractedEntities\n`\n\nYou typically don't instantiate `ExtractedEntities` directly. Instead, you define your custom entity and relationship types, and\n Graphiti handles the extraction and population of the `ExtractedEntities` model.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process\n:\n\n1. **Define Your Ontology**:\n   First, you define your custom entity and relationship types using Pydantic models.\n This is the most critical step, as it dictates the structure of your knowledge graph.\n\n   \n```python\n   from pydantic\n import BaseModel, Field\n   from typing import List\n\n   class Person(BaseModel):\n       name: str = Field(\n..., description=\"The name of the person\")\n\n   class Company(BaseModel):\n       name: str = Field\n(..., description=\"The name of the company\")\n\n   class WorksAt(BaseModel):\n       person: Person\n\n       company: Company\n       role: str = Field(..., description=\"The person's role at the company\")\n\n   \n```\n\n\n2. **Configure Graphiti**:\n   Next, you configure Graphiti with your ontology and an LLM client\n.\n\n   \n```python\n   from graphiti import Graphiti\n   from graphiti.llm import Ollama\n\n   #\n Configure the LLM client\n   llm = Ollama(model=\"llama3\")\n\n   # Initialize Graphiti with your\n ontology\n   graphiti = Graphiti(\n       llm=llm,\n       entities=[Person, Company],\n\n       relationships=[WorksAt],\n   )\n   \n```\n\n\n3. **Process a Document**:\n   When you process a\n document with Graphiti, the LLM will extract entities and relationships based on your ontology. The result of this extraction is an\n `ExtractedEntities` object.\n\n   \n```python\n   text = \"John Doe is a software engineer at Google\n.\"\n   extracted_data = graphiti.process(text)\n\n   # The extracted_data object is an\n instance of ExtractedEntities\n   # You can access the extracted entities and relationships like this:\n   for entity in extracted\n_data.entities:\n       if isinstance(entity, Person):\n           print(f\"Found Person: {\nentity.name}\")\n       elif isinstance(entity, Company):\n           print(f\"Found Company: {entity\n.name}\")\n\n   for relationship in extracted_data.relationships:\n       if isinstance(relationship, WorksAt):\n\n           print(\n               f\"{relationship.person.name} works at \"\n               f\"{relationship.company.\nname} as a \"\n               f\"{relationship.role}\"\n           )\n   \n```\n\n\n### The `ExtractedEntities\n` Model Structure\n\nWhile you don't typically create `ExtractedEntities` instances manually, it's helpful to\n understand their structure. The model is defined within Graphiti's core and looks something like this:\n\n\n```python\n\nclass ExtractedEntities(BaseModel):\n    entities: List[BaseModel] = Field(\n        ..., description\n=\"A list of entities extracted from the text.\"\n    )\n    relationships: List[BaseModel] = Field\n(\n        ..., description=\"A list of relationships between the extracted entities.\"\n    )\n\n```\n\n\nThis structure allows\n `ExtractedEntities` to hold a heterogeneous list of your custom entity and relationship types, providing a flexible yet validated way to represent\n the extracted knowledge.\n\nBy leveraging Pydantic models for both the ontology and the extraction response, Graphiti ensures that\n your knowledge graph is built on a foundation of structured, validated, and domain-specific data.","hint":"A correct answer should explain what the `ExtractedEntities` `response_model` is in Graphiti (a Pydantic model representing the structured entity-extraction output) and show, at least briefly, how to call an LLM or Graphiti API with that response model and handle/validate the returned `extracted_entities` field (including correct field names/types like entity name, type ID, and attributes, and awareness that models must emit schema-compliant JSON to avoid validation errors).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026","timestamp":21463},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":21463},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770549635755-7b84e2915e5d7","status":"completed","timestamp":21463},{"type":"message","content":"The `ExtractedEntities` model in Graphiti is a Pydantic model","timestamp":21463},{"type":"message","content":" that plays a crucial role in the entity extraction process.

{"id":"websearch-1764","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?\nDetecting and preventing proxy rotation attacks on\n e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026 requires a sophisticated, multi-layered approach that goes beyond traditional\n security measures. As attackers increasingly use advanced techniques to mimic human behavior and evade detection, e-commerce platforms must adopt more intelligent\n and adaptive defense mechanisms.\n\n### Detecting Proxy Rotation Attacks\n\nThe key to detecting these attacks is to look for patterns that\n distinguish automated bot activity from genuine human behavior, even when IP addresses are constantly changing.\n\n*   **Behavioral Analysis:** This\n is one of the most effective methods. By analyzing user interactions such as mouse movements, typing speed, scrolling patterns, and the\n time taken to complete forms, platforms can identify non-human-like behavior. Bots, even sophisticated ones, often exhibit\n patterns that deviate from genuine user interactions.\n\n*   **Device and Browser Fingerprinting:** Instead of relying solely on IP addresses, platforms\n can create unique fingerprints for each user based on their device and browser characteristics. This includes factors like screen resolution, installed fonts, user\n-agent strings, and even battery status. If multiple accounts are accessed from devices with the same fingerprint but different IP addresses,\n it can be a strong indicator of a proxy rotation attack.\n\n*   **Request Rate and Pattern Analysis:** While attackers\n rotate IPs, their requests may still exhibit predictable patterns. Monitoring for abnormally high request rates from a wide range of IPs that\n share other characteristics (like the same user-agent or accessing the same set of pages in the same order) can help identify bot\n activity.\n\n*   **Transaction and Account Monitoring:** Closely monitoring account and transaction activities can reveal signs of attacks. This includes:\n\n    *   A high number of failed login attempts from various IPs targeting a single account.\n    *   Rapid\n creation of multiple new accounts from different IPs but with similar personal information.\n    *   Unusual purchasing patterns, such as multiple users\n buying the same item at the same time.\n\n*   **Reputation Analysis of IP Addresses:** While less effective against residential\n proxies, analyzing the reputation of IP addresses can still be valuable. Datacenter IPs, which are often used in bot attacks\n, can be more easily identified and blocked.\n\n### Preventing Proxy Rotation Attacks\n\nPrevention strategies should focus on making it more difficult and\n costly for attackers to succeed, while minimizing the impact on legitimate users.\n\n*   **Implement a Multi-Layered Security Approach:**\n No single solution is foolproof. A combination of the detection techniques mentioned above, along with other security measures, is essential.\n This includes web application firewalls (WAFs), API security gateways, and dedicated bot management solutions.\n\n*   \n**Utilize Advanced Bot Detection and Management Solutions:** In 2026, relying on in-house solutions alone\n is often insufficient. Specialized bot management services use machine learning and AI to analyze vast amounts of data from across the internet to\n identify and block malicious bots in real-time. These solutions can adapt to new attack methods more quickly than traditional security tools\n.\n\n*   **Intelligent Rate Limiting:** Instead of basic rate limiting based on IP address, implement more intelligent policies\n that consider a combination of factors, such as device fingerprint, user behavior, and the specific resources being accessed.\n\n*   **Use\n of Advanced CAPTCHAs and Challenges:** Traditional CAPTCHAs are becoming less effective as AI can now solve them. Instead\n, platforms should use adaptive and invisible challenges that are presented only when suspicious activity is detected. These can include behavioral challenges that\n are difficult for bots to mimic.\n\n*   **Secure APIs:** APIs are a primary target for bot attacks. Implementing\n strong API security measures, such as OAuth 2.0, rate limiting, and request validation, is crucial.\n\n*   \n**Strengthen Account Security:** Enforce strong password policies and encourage the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n While some advanced phishing attacks can bypass MFA, it remains a significant deterrent for many automated attacks.\n\n*   **Continuous Monitoring\n and Adaptation:** The landscape of bot attacks is constantly evolving. E-commerce platforms must continuously monitor for new threats and be\n prepared to adapt their security measures accordingly. This includes regularly updating security rules, analyzing new attack patterns, and investing in new security\n technologies.\n\nBy implementing a comprehensive strategy that combines advanced detection techniques with a multi-layered prevention approach, e-commerce platforms like Sho\npee can effectively combat proxy rotation attacks and protect their users and business from the growing threat of malicious bots.","hint":"Answer must (1) explain what proxy rotation attacks are in the e‑commerce context (bots or fraudsters using fast‑changing IPs/residential proxies/VPNs to evade IP‑based rate limits, detection, and blocks), and (2) describe concrete 2026‑appropriate detection and prevention measures beyond simple IP blocking—e.g., device/browser fingerprinting, behavioral/velocity analysis, account‑level and session‑level anomaly detection, ML‑based bot management, stricter authentication/step‑up verification, and WAF/CDN or specialized bot‑mitigation services applicable to large marketplaces like Shopee.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":26710},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":26710},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770549679356-201af9ed990fb","status":"completed","timestamp":26710},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770549679372-914ab32a92e7a8","status":"completed","timestamp":26710},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770549679390-cbb022f5c06178","status":"completed","timestamp":26710},{"type":"message","content":"Detecting and preventing proxy rotation attacks on","timestamp":26710},{"type":"message","content":" e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026 requires a sophisticated, multi-layered approach that goes beyond traditional","timestamp":26710},{"type":"message","content":" security measures.

{"id":"websearch-1806","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?\nTo use the `rust-libp2p` relay client to dial through a relay, you'll need to perform\n the following steps:\n\n1.  **Set up a relay server:** You need a publicly reachable node that will act as a relay\n.\n2.  **Configure the listener:** The peer that wants to be reached through the relay needs to connect to the relay and\n reserve a slot.\n3.  **Configure the dialer:** The peer that wants to connect to the listener will\n use the relay's address to dial the listener.\n\nThe `dcutr` (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay) protocol\n is used to upgrade the relayed connection to a direct connection, also known as \"hole punching\".\n\nHere is a conceptual\n example of how you would use the relay client behavior. This is based on the `dcutr` example in the \n`rust-libp2p` repository.\n\n### 1. Add `libp2p` to your dependencies\n\nMake\n sure you have the `relay` and `dcutr` features enabled in your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n\n```toml\n\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.53.2\", features = [\"relay\", \"d\ncutr\", \"identify\", \"ping\", \"macros\", \"tcp\", \"noise\", \"yamux\", \"qu\nic\", \"tokio\"] }\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Set up the Swarm\n\nYou will need to\n create a `Swarm` that includes the `relay::client::Behaviour` and `dcutr::Behaviour`. The\n `identify` and `ping` behaviours are also recommended for discovering and maintaining connections.\n\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n\n    dcutr,\n    identify,\n    identity,\n    ping,\n    relay,\n    swarm\n::{Swarm, SwarmEvent},\n    SwarmBuilder,\n};\nuse std::error::Error;\n\nuse tokio::io::{self, AsyncBufReadExt};\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result\n<(), Box<dyn Error>> {\n    // Create a random PeerId\n    let local_key = identity::Keypair::\ngenerate_ed25519();\n    let local_peer_id = local_key.public().\nto_peer_id();\n    println!(\"Local peer id: {}\", local_peer_id);\n\n    let\n (relay_transport, client) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n\n    let transport\n = todo!(); // See https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/master/examples\n/dcutr/src/main.rs for a full transport implementation\n\n    let behaviour = Behaviour {\n        relay\n_client: client,\n        ping: ping::Behaviour::new(ping::Config::new()),\n        identify\n: identify::Behaviour::new(identify::Config::new(\n            \"/TODO/0.0.1\".to_\nstring(),\n            local_key.public(),\n        )),\n        dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour::new\n(local_peer_id),\n    };\n\n    let mut swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_tokio_executor\n(transport, behaviour, local_peer_id).build();\n\n    // ...\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\n\n#[derive(libp2p::NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct Behaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour\n,\n    ping: ping::Behaviour,\n    identify: identify::Behaviour,\n    dcutr: d\ncutr::Behaviour,\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Listener (Bob)\n\nThe listener will connect to the relay\n and then wait for incoming connections.\n\n\n```rust\n// Listen on all interfaces and whatever port the OS assigns\nswarm\n.listen_on(\"/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0\".parse()?)?;\n\nswarm.listen_on(\"/ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/0/quic-\nv1\".parse()?)?;\n\n\n// Tell the relay that we want to be reachable through it\nlet relay_address:\n libp2p::Multiaddr = \"/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4\n001\".parse()?;\nlet relay_peer_id: libp2p::PeerId = \"1\n2D3KooWDpJ7As7BWAwRMfu1VU2WCqNjvq387\nJEYKDBj4kx6nXTN\".parse()?; // The relay's PeerId\n\nswarm.\nlisten_on(relay_address.with(libp2p::multiaddr::Protocol::P2p(relay_peer_\nid.into())))?;\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Dialer (Alice)\n\nThe dialer will use the relay's\n address to connect to the listener.\n\n\n```rust\nlet relay_address: libp2p::Multiaddr =\n \"/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001\".parse()?;\n\nlet relay_peer_id: libp2p::PeerId = \"12D3KooWDpJ\n7As7BWAwRMfu1VU2WCqNjvq387JEYKDBj4\nkx6nXTN\".parse()?; // The relay's PeerId\nlet listener_peer_id: lib\np2p::PeerId = \"12D3KooWPjceQrSwdWXPyLLeAB\nRXmuqt69Rg3sBYbU1Nft9HyQ6X\".parse()?; // The listener's\n PeerId\n\nlet addr = relay_address\n    .with(libp2p::multiaddr::Protocol::P2\np(relay_peer_id.into()))\n    .with(libp2p::multiaddr::Protocol::\nP2pCircuit)\n    .with(libp2p::multiaddr::Protocol::P2p(listener_\npeer_id.into()));\n\nswarm.dial(addr)?;\n\n```\n\n\nThe key part is the `P2\npCircuit` protocol in the `Multiaddr`. This tells the `Swarm` to use the relay to connect to the target\n peer.\n\nThis is a simplified example. For a complete, working example, please refer to the `dcutr\n` example in the `rust-libp2p` GitHub repository.

和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？\n在2026年，利用“锁定效应”（Lock-in Effect\n）和“路径依赖”（Path Dependency）构建难以模仿的竞争壁-垒，核心在于深度整合新兴技术（\n尤其是AI）、数据和生态系统，创造出让用户难以“离开”的产品或服务。\n\n以下是具体的\n策略分析和建议：\n\n### **理解核心概念**\n\n*   **锁定效应 (Lock-in Effect):** 指\n用户在转换到另一家供应商的产品或服务时，会面临显著的成本、时间、精力或学习曲线\n，因此倾向于“锁定”在现有的供应商上。成本不仅是金钱，也包括心理、流程\n和技术上的转换成本。\n*   **路径依赖 (Path Dependency):** 指一旦进入某个发展路径，无论是\n技术、标准还是商业模式，未来的决策都会受到初始选择的影响，并且很难或成本极高地偏离这条\n路径。每一次的投入和优化，都在加深这条“壕沟”。\n\n### **2026年\n构建竞争壁垒的核心策略**\n\n结合当前的技术趋势，特别是AI的深度发展，以下是几个关键的战略\n方向：\n\n**1. 构建深度整合的AI解决方案，形成“技术锁定”**\n\n*   **从通用\n走向专用 (From General to Specific):** 市场竞争的焦点正从通用大模型转向面向特定场景和\n行业的专用AI解决方案。通过设计和优化专用的AI芯片（ASIC）、算法和软件框架，可以为特定\n任务提供极致的性能和效率。\n    *   **案例启发 (如Broadcom的策略):** 正\n如一些分析指出的，通过为大型科技公司提供定制化的AI芯片，不仅满足了它们独特的需求，也\n让其上层的软件、算法和模型深度依赖于这些特定的硬件架构。一旦客户的整个技术栈（\nTech Stack）都围绕你的硬件进行了优化，更换供应商的成本和风险将是巨大的。\n*   **\n构建“AI助手”或“智能体 (Agent)”:** 打造深度嵌入用户工作流的AI智能体。这种\n智能体通过学习用户的习惯、偏好和业务流程（即“上下文工程”），提供高度个性化和自动\n化的服务。用户投入的时间越多，智能体就越“懂”他，也就越难以被替代。\n\n\n**2. 打造数据驱动的生态系统，实现“数据锁定”**\n\n*   **建立“数据\n飞轮” (Data Flywheel):** 设计一个能从用户交互中持续学习和优化的系统。用户\n使用产品 -> 产生数据 -> AI模型学习优化 -> 提供更好的体验 -> 吸引更多用户。这个循环一旦\n形成，后来者很难在数据和模型效果上进行追赶。\n*   **人机协同与隐\n性知识沉淀 (Human-in-the-Loop & Tacit Knowledge):** 在系统中嵌入“人在环\n路”机制。这不仅能通过人的反馈来校验和提升AI的准确性，更重要的是，系统能够\n捕捉和学习那些难以言传的、专家级别的“隐性知识”。这些知识会逐渐沉淀为企业的\n核心数字资产，并成为竞争对手无法获得的关键优势。\n*   **构建知识管理闭环:** 将\n工具从“辅助人”的角色，转变为“传承知识”的系统。当一个组织的工作流程、决策逻辑\n和历史经验都被一个平台所承载和学习时，这个平台就从一个工具变成了组织记忆的一部分，替换\n它就意味着“格式化”组织的智慧。\n\n**3. 设计多层次的转换成本，形成“价值\n锁定”**\n\n*   **经济与合同锁定:**\n    *   **订阅制与长期合同:** 提供\n基于长期订阅的优惠，或者将核心服务与长期合同绑定。\n    *   **生态系统交叉补贴:** 在\n一个产品上提供极具吸引力的价格（甚至免费），但在另一个高度依赖的关联产品上获利，\n增加用户离开整个生态的成本。\n*   **技术与流程锁定:**\n    *   **专有标准\n与API:**

{"id":"websearch-1909","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026\nSetting up HA\nProxy as a SOCKS5 proxy that allows connections from your LAN for use with an antidetect browser is an advanced configuration. Here\n is a general guide to help you achieve this.\n\nThis guide assumes you have a basic understanding of networking concepts and are comfortable\n working with the command line.\n\n### 1. Install HAProxy\n\nFirst, you need to install HAProxy on\n your system. The installation process will vary depending on your operating system.\n\n**For Debian/Ubuntu:**\n\n\n```bash\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install haproxy\n\n```\n\n\n**For CentOS/RHEL:**\n\n\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install haproxy\n```\n\n\n### 2. Configure HAProxy for SOCKS5\n\n\nHAProxy is primarily a TCP/HTTP load balancer, and SOCKS5 support isn't a built-in feature in\n the same way as HTTP. However, you can configure HAProxy to function as a TCP proxy, which can effectively handle\n SOCKS5 traffic.\n\nCreate or edit the HAProxy configuration file, typically located at `/etc/haproxy\n/haproxy.cfg`.\n\nHere is a sample configuration:\n\n\n```\nglobal\n    log /dev/log    \nlocal0\n    log /dev/log    local1 notice\n    chroot /var/lib/haproxy\n\n    stats socket /run/haproxy/admin.sock mode 660 level admin expose-fd\n listeners\n    stats timeout 30s\n    user haproxy\n    group haproxy\n    daemon\n\n\ndefaults\n    log     global\n    mode    tcp\n    option  tcplog\n    option  dontlog\nnull\n    timeout connect 5000\n    timeout client  50000\n    timeout server\n  50000\n\nfrontend socks5_in\n    # Replace 0.0.0.0 with\n your server's LAN IP to restrict access\n    bind 0.0.0.0:1080\n\n    default_backend socks5_out\n\nbackend socks5_out\n    # This is where you would define\n your backend SOCKS5 server(s)\n    # If you are using a single SOCKS5 proxy, you would put\n its IP and port here.\n    # For example, if you have a SOCKS5 proxy running on 19\n2.168.1.100:10800\n    server socks_proxy \n192.168.1.100:10800\n\n```\n\n\n### \n3. \"Allow Connections from LAN\"\n\nTo allow connections from other devices on your LAN, you need to configure the `bind\n` directive in your HAProxy configuration.\n\n*   **To allow connections from any device on your LAN:**\n    Use\n `bind 0.0.0.0:1080`. This tells HAProxy to listen on all available\n network interfaces.\n\n*   **To allow connections from a specific LAN IP address:**\n    If the machine running HAProxy\n has a LAN IP address of, for example, `192.168.1.50`, you can\n use `bind 192.168.1.50:1080`.\n\nMake\n sure that your firewall is not blocking the port you are using (in this example, port `1080`).\n\n### \n4. Restart HAProxy\n\nAfter saving your configuration, restart the HAProxy service to apply the changes:\n\n\n```bash\n\nsudo systemctl restart haproxy\n\n```\n\n\n### 5. Configure Your Antidetect Browser\n\nNow, in\n your antidetect browser's proxy settings, you will configure it to use your new HAProxy SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n\n*   **Proxy Type:** SOCKS5\n*   **Host/IP:** The LAN IP address of the machine running HAProxy\n (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).\n*   **Port:** The\n port you configured in `haproxy.cfg` (e.g., `1080`).\n\n### Important\n Considerations:\n\n*   **No Authentication:** The provided HAProxy configuration does not include any authentication. This means anyone on\n your LAN can use this proxy. For a more secure setup, you would need to implement ACLs (Access Control Lists\n) in HAProxy to restrict access to specific IP addresses.\n*   **Upstream Proxy:** This guide assumes you have an\n existing SOCKS5 proxy that HAProxy will forward traffic to. If you want HAProxy to *be* the S\nOCKS5 server itself, that is a more complex scenario that may require Lua scripting, as HAProxy does not natively support the\n SOCKS5 protocol.\n*   **Troubleshooting:** Check the HAProxy log files for any errors. The location\n of the log files will depend on your system configuration, but they are often in `/var/log/haproxy.\nlog`.\n\nThis guide provides a basic framework. You may need to adapt the configuration to your specific needs and network environment.","hint":"The answer must explain that you enable “Allow connections from LAN” in the HAPP (or Happ) proxy settings, obtain or configure a SOCKS5 proxy port/IP from HAPP, and then enter that SOCKS5 proxy (host, port, and any authentication) into the antidetect browser’s proxy/profile settings so the browser’s traffic is routed through the HAPP SOCKS5 proxy.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026","timestamp":26648},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":26648},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770550286903-a06f0b77f1c958","status":"completed","timestamp":26648},{"type":"message","content":"Setting up HA","timestamp":26648},{"type":"message","content":"Proxy as a SOCKS5 proxy that allows connections from your LAN for use with an antidetect browser is an advanced configuration.

{"id":"websearch-1926","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025?\nAs of October 2025, the best practices for ETL data pipelines have evolved to embrace the modern\n data stack, with a strong emphasis on automation, data quality, and real-time processing. Here are the latest best practices:\n\n\n### 1. Embrace ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)\n\nThe paradigm has largely shifted from traditional ETL to EL\nT. Instead of transforming data before loading it into the data warehouse, the ELT approach loads raw data directly into the warehouse and then\n performs transformations using the warehouse's computational power.\n\n*   **Benefits:** This approach is more scalable, flexible, and allows\n for a wider range of transformations. It also preserves the raw data, which can be invaluable for new analytics projects and for\n regulatory compliance.\n*   **Tools:** dbt has emerged as a key tool for managing the \"T\" in\n ELT, allowing teams to transform data in the warehouse using SQL.\n\n### 2. Modern Orchestration and Automation\n\n\nModern data pipelines are complex and require sophisticated orchestration tools to manage dependencies, scheduling, and retries.\n\n*   **Best\n Practices:**\n    *   **Use a modern orchestrator:** Tools like Airflow, Dagster, and Prefect provide\n robust features for managing complex workflows, including dynamic pipeline generation, SLA tracking, and rich monitoring interfaces.\n    *   **Autom\nate everything:** From infrastructure provisioning (Infrastructure as Code) to data quality testing and pipeline deployments (CI/CD), automation\n is key to building reliable and scalable data pipelines.\n\n### 3. Data Quality and Governance\n\nAs data becomes more critical for\n business operations, ensuring its quality and governing its use is paramount.\n\n*   **Best Practices:**\n    *   **\nImplement Data Contracts:** Treat your data like a product. Data contracts are formal agreements between data producers and consumers that define the schema\n, semantics, and quality expectations of the data.\n    *   **Automated Data Quality Testing:** Integrate data quality tests\n directly into your pipelines. Tools like Great Expectations allow you to define \"expectations\" about your data, and your pipeline\n will fail if these expectations are not met.\n    *   **Data Governance Frameworks:** Establish clear data ownership,\n lineage, and access control policies. This is crucial for compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\n\n### 4. Real\n-Time and Streaming Data Processing\n\nThe demand for real-time data has led to the adoption of streaming ETL pipelines.\n\n*\n   **Best Practices:**\n    *   **Use a streaming platform:** Technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and\n Spark Streaming are the go-to choices for building real-time data pipelines.\n    *   **Design for exactly\n-once semantics:** For critical applications like financial transactions, ensure that your streaming pipeline processes each event exactly once, even in\n the event of failures. This is typically achieved through checkpointing and watermarking.\n\n### 5. Cloud-Native and\n Cost-Effective Pipelines (FinOps)\n\nThe cloud is the dominant platform for modern data pipelines, offering scalability and flexibility\n. However, it's crucial to manage costs effectively.\n\n*   **Best Practices:**\n    *   **Lever\nage serverless and managed services:** Cloud providers offer a rich set of managed services for data processing (e.g., AWS Glue,\n Azure Data Factory, Google Cloud Dataflow) that can reduce operational overhead and optimize costs.\n    *   **Implement\n FinOps for data:** Actively monitor and optimize the cost of your data pipelines. This includes choosing the right instance types,\n using spot instances for non-critical workloads, and optimizing data storage.\n\n### 6. Data Observability\n\nData\n observability is the practice of monitoring the health of your data pipelines and the quality of the data within them.\n\n*   **Best\n Practices:**\n    *   **Monitor key metrics:** Track data freshness, volume, and schema changes.\n    *\n   **Implement data lineage:** Understand where your data comes from, how it's transformed, and where it's\n used. This is crucial for debugging and impact analysis.\n    *   **Use a data observability platform:** Several tools are emerging\n that provide a holistic view of your data pipelines and help you proactively identify and resolve data quality issues.\n\nBy adopting these best\n practices, organizations can build robust, scalable, and reliable data pipelines that deliver high-quality data for analytics and decision-making\n.","hint":"To earn full credit, an answer must identify that modern ETL best practices (as of late 2025) emphasize cloud-native, scalable architectures (often ELT-first and/or lakehouse/zero-ETL patterns), modular and orchestrated pipelines (e.g., with tools like Airflow/Dagster), support for both batch and streaming/CDC, strong data quality/observability and governance, automation (including AI-driven optimization where relevant), and software-engineering practices such as version control, testing, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code.

{"id":"websearch-1960","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?\nManaging Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in a production environment requires a well\n-defined strategy to ensure that you are effectively managing risk without overwhelming your security and development teams. As of 20\n26, the best practices have matured to favor automation, policy-as-code, and a risk-based approach.\n\nHere\n is a guide on how to manage baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in production:\n\n### 1. **\nUnderstanding the Goal of Exception Management**\n\nThe primary goal of exception management is to acknowledge and accept a security risk for a valid\n reason, while ensuring that the exception is temporary, well-documented, and regularly reviewed. It is not about silencing noisy\n alerts but about making informed decisions about your security posture.\n\n### 2. **Strategies for Managing Exceptions**\n\nThere are\n several ways to manage exceptions with `tfsec` and `checkov`. The best approach is to use a combination of\n these methods, depending on your organization's needs.\n\n#### **a. In-Code Annotations (Suppressions\n)**\n\nFor specific, one-off exceptions, you can use in-line comments to suppress a finding for a particular resource\n. This is useful when a rule is generally valid but does not apply to a specific resource for a good reason.\n\n**\ntfsec:**\n\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = \"my\n-tfsec-bucket-example\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n\n# tfsec:ignore:\naws-s3-enable-public-access-block\n  tags = {\n    Name        = \"My\n bucket\"\n    Environment = \"Dev\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Checkov:**\n\n\n```terraform\n\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = \"my-checkov-bucket\n-example\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n\n#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_2\n0:Public access block should be enabled\n  tags = {\n    Name        = \"My bucket\"\n    Environment =\n \"Dev\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Pros:**\n*   The exception is clearly visible in the code,\n next to the resource it applies to.\n*   It's easy to add and remove exceptions.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n*   Can lead to a proliferation of comments in your codebase.\n*   Difficult to get a centralized view of\n all exceptions.\n\n#### **b. Configuration Files**\n\nFor broader exceptions, such as ignoring a rule for an entire module\n or for a specific set of resources, you can use configuration files.\n\n**tfsec (now part of Trivy):\n**\n\nAs of recent developments, `tfsec` has been integrated into `Trivy`. While `tfsec` specific\n configuration might still work, it's recommended to adopt the `Trivy` way of configuration. You can use\n a `.trivy.yaml` file to exclude specific rules.\n\n\n```yaml\nmisconfiguration:\n  ignore\n:\n    - id: AVD-AWS-0086\n      paths:\n        - \"module\n/my-legacy-module\"\n\n```\n\n\n**Checkov:**\n\nCheckov allows you to use a `.check\nov.yaml` or `config.yaml` file to manage exceptions.\n\n\n```yaml\nskip-check:\n  -\n CKV_AWS_20\n  - CKV_AWS_21\n\n```\n\n\n**Pros:**\n*   \nCentralized management of exceptions.\n*   Keeps your Terraform code clean.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   Can\n be more difficult to track which resources a specific exception applies to.\n\n#### **c. Baselining**\n\nBaselining is the process\n of creating an initial snapshot of your security findings and accepting them as a baseline. From that point on, only new findings\n will be flagged as issues. This is particularly useful when you start scanning a large, existing codebase.\n\nBoth `tfsec\n` and `checkov` support outputting results in various formats (JSON, SARIF, etc.). You can use these\n outputs to create a baseline file.\n\n**A typical baselining workflow:**\n\n1.  Run an initial scan and\n save the output as a baseline file (e.g., `baseline.json`).\n2.  In your CI/CD pipeline\n, run a new scan on every change.\n3.  Compare the new scan's output with the `baseline.json\n` file.\n4.  Fail the build only if new issues are introduced that are not in the baseline.\n5.  Period\nically review the baseline to address the accepted risks.\n\n### 3. **Best Practices for Production Environments in 2\n026**\n\n#### **a. Policy-as-Code (PaC)**\n\nTreat your security policies,\n including exceptions, as code. Store your configuration files, custom rules, and baseline files in a version control system (like Git).\n This allows you to:\n\n*   Track changes to your security policies over time.\n*   Use pull requests to\n review and approve changes to exceptions.\n*   Integrate security policy changes into your existing development workflows.\n\n#### **\nb. CI/CD Integration**\n\nIntegrate `tfsec` and `checkov` into your CI/CD\n pipeline to automate security scanning. This ensures that all code changes are scanned before they are deployed to production.\n\n*   **Fail\n Fast:** Configure your pipeline to fail if new, high-severity issues are detected.\n*   **Gate Deploys:** Use\n the scan results as a quality gate for deployments to production.\n*   **Automated Comments:** Use tools like \n`tfsec-pr-commenter-action` for GitHub to automatically post findings as comments on pull requests.\n\n#### **c.\n Auditing and Review**\n\nExceptions should not be permanent. Schedule regular reviews of all exceptions to determine if they are still\n valid.\n\n*   **Time-Bound Exceptions:** When adding an exception, include a timeframe for when it should be reviewed.\n\n*   **Ownership:** Assign an owner to each exception who is responsible for reviewing it.\n*   **Justification:** Require\n a clear justification for every exception, including the reason for the risk and any compensating controls in place.\n\n#### **d. Break\n-Glass Procedures**\n\nIn case of an emergency, you may need to bypass a security policy. Have a well-defined\n \"break-glass\" procedure in place that is:\n\n*   **Logged:** All break-glass events should be logged and audited\n.\n*   **Approved:** Require approval from a security team or a senior engineer.\n*   **Temporary:** The bypass\n should be temporary and reviewed after the emergency is over.\n\n### 4. **Tool-Specific Guidance**\n\n*   **\ntfsec (Trivy):** Since `tfsec` is now part of `Trivy`, it is recommended to start\n using `Trivy` for IaC scanning. `Trivy` provides a more comprehensive solution that can scan for\n vulnerabilities in your container images and other artifacts, in addition to your Terraform code.\n*   **Checkov:** \n`Checkov` has a rich set of features and integrations, including a VS Code extension and pre-commit hooks. It also\n supports a wide range of IaC frameworks beyond Terraform.\n\n### 5. **The Future of IaC Security**\n\n\nThe trend in IaC security is towards consolidation and integration. We are seeing tools like `tfsec` being merged into larger\n platforms like `Trivy`. This provides a more unified and streamlined experience for developers and security teams. As we move further\n into 2026, expect to see more of this consolidation and a greater emphasis on integrating security into the entire software\n development lifecycle.","hint":"A correct answer must describe concrete practices for managing and documenting baseline/exception handling for Terraform security scans specifically with tfsec and Checkov (e.g., how to mark/track justified suppressions, set expiry/review, and keep the baseline under change control), and explain how these are integrated into a production CI/CD workflow (e.g., enforcement on PRs vs. main, policy-as-code, approvals) to minimize long‑lived risk by 2026.[[1, 2, 3]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","timestamp":36499},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":36499},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770550526929-5feef9bdb29d08","status":"completed","timestamp":36499},{"type":"message","content":"Managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in a production environment requires a well","timestamp":36499},{"type":"message","content":"-defined strategy to ensure that you are effectively managing risk without overwhelming your security and development teams.
