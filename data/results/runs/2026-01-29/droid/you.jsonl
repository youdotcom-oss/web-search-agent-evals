Pages are getting shorter without becoming shallow.\n\n2. **Mobile-First Foundation** - With 67%+ of web traffic from mobile (75%+ for retail/entertainment), responsive design isn't a feature—it's the foundation.\n\n3. **Strategic Hero Images** - Large, impactful visuals that instantly convey the core message and elevate aesthetic appeal.\n\n4. **Bold Typography** - Large typefaces add drama and grab attention instantly, delivering \"wow factor\" with crisp graphics.\n\n5. **Personalized Experiences** - Dynamic text, pricing previews, and segmented messaging based on visitor context (company size, product type, workflow).\n\n### Conversion-Focused Elements\n- **Minimal, Meaningful Micro-Animations** - CTA button hover/pulse effects, scroll-triggered reveals that add meaning without noise\n- **Sticky Headers with Smart CTAs** - Persistent \"Try Free\" buttons that stay visible while scrolling\n- **Fewer Navigation Links** - Navigation treated as part of the conversion funnel, not just a directory\n- **A/B Testing** - Data-driven approach with multiple landing page variations\n\n---\n\n## Responsive Design Patterns for Galleries\n\n### Layout Patterns\n1. **Bento Grids** - Modular, asymmetric card-like blocks inspired by Japanese lunch boxes. Excellent for showcasing diverse content and stacks cleanly on mobile.\n\n2. **Masonry Layouts** - Dynamic arrangements that adapt to content size while maintaining visual interest.\n\n3. **CSS Grid + Flexbox Combination** - Grid for overall structure, Flexbox for component-level arrangements.\n\n4. **Container Queries** - Components adapt based on their parent container's size rather than viewport, creating truly context-aware responsive designs.\n\n### Gallery Best Practices\n- **Vertical/Portrait Photography** - Dominates mobile-first design, aligning with how users consume content on smartphones\n- **Card UI Patterns** - Content containers that resize easily and allow size hierarchy to prioritize content\n- **Responsive Images** - Deliver appropriately sized and formatted files based on device, screen size, and network conditions\n- **Thumb-Friendly Navigation** - Touch-friendly interfaces with familiar patterns like \"pull to refresh\"\n\n---\n\n## Responsive Pricing Table Patterns\n\n### Layout Options\n1. **Card-Based Design** - Multiple pricing plans displayed side-by-side with subtle shadows, borders, or background colors defining each card\n\n2. **Column Layout with Flexbox/Grid** - Responsive columns that break down into stacked rows on smaller screens\n\n3. **Feature-First Tables** - Spotlight core features of each plan prominently\n\n4. **Toggle Switches** - Interactive \"Monthly/Yearly\" toggles using checkboxes for plan comparison\n\n### Design Best Practices\n- **\"Best Value\" Highlighting** - Use `scale()` transforms and shadows to emphasize recommended plans\n- **Hover Animations** - Subtle border hover effects and color accents to focus attention\n- **Consistent Typography & Spacing** - Clear hierarchy of information with proper visual weight\n- **Price Details** - Include payment period, currency, prefix/postfix boxes for complete pricing context\n- **Two-Plan Simplicity** - For quick decisions, Basic vs. Advanced layouts work well\n- **Multicolor Differentiation** - Distinct colors to differentiate each pricing tier\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS** - Frameworks for built-in responsive behavior\n- **Flexbox-Based Tables** - Future-proof responsive formatting\n- **Background Gradients** - Professional appearance with purple/dark color schemes\n- **Sticky Headers** - Keep plan names visible while scrolling through features\n\n---\n\n## Key 2026 Trends Summary\n| Area | Trend |\n|------|-------|\n| **Performance** | Sub-3-second load times, optimized images |\n| **Layouts** | Bento grids, container queries, mobile-first |\n| **Interactivity** | Purposeful micro-animations, hover states |\n| **Personalization** | Segmented CTAs, dynamic content |\n| **Accessibility** | Consistent navigation, touch-friendly interfaces |\n| **Pricing Tables** | Card-based, toggle switches, feature highlighting |","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","timestamp":32507},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":32507},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018GPjYiSDT9TK32yBz8hGhL","status":"completed","timestamp":32507},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016nZokcVdGE8aV5GzRgPNqM","status":"completed","timestamp":32507},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XEnf7YoG49GvEpPM4TW53y","status":"completed","timestamp":32507},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive research, here's a summary of the **best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Landing Page Strategies for 2026\n\n### Core Design Principles\n1. **Clean, Focused Layouts** - Strip away unnecessary elements to draw attention directly to the core message and CTA.

It comes with **80+ pre-built toolkits**, including web search capabilities. Here are the main ways to use web search tools in Agno:\n\n### 1. **DuckDuckGo Search (Most Common Built-in Option)**\n\n```python\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4o\"),\n    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],\n    show_tool_calls=True,\n    markdown=True\n)\n\nagent.print_response(\"What's the latest news from NYC?\")\n```\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npip install agno duckduckgo-search openai\n```\n\n### 2. **Google Search Tools**\n\n```python\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.tools.googlesearch import GoogleSearchTools\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4.5-preview\"),\n    tools=[\n        GoogleSearchTools(\n            stop_after_tool_call_tools=[\"google_search\"],\n            show_result_tools=[\"google_search\"],\n        )\n    ],\n    show_tool_calls=True,\n)\n\nagent.print_response(\"What's the latest news about GPT-4.5?\", markdown=True)\n```\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Tools in Agno are Python callables** that you pass into the agent\n- Tools make agents \"agentic\" by giving them capabilities beyond text generation (web search, data lookup, database queries, custom Python functions, etc.)\n- Agno's tool system is **modular** - you can mix and match tools from APIs to custom scripts\n\n### Custom Python Function as a Tool\n\nYou can also create your own search function as a tool:\n\n```python\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\n\ndef my_web_search(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Custom web search function\"\"\"\n    # Your custom search logic here\n    return f\"Search results for: {query}\"\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4o\"),\n    tools=[my_web_search],  # Pass your function directly\n    show_tool_calls=True,\n)\n\nagent.print_response(\"Search for Python tutorials\")\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nAgno 2.0.4 provides built-in web search through:\n1. **`DuckDuckGoTools`** from `agno.tools.duckduckgo` (requires `duckduckgo-search` package)\n2. **`GoogleSearchTools`** from `agno.tools.googlesearch`\n3. **Custom Python functions** passed directly to the `tools` parameter\n\nThe framework is designed for simplicity - you write AI logic using plain Python constructs, and tools are just callables that extend agent capabilities.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the built-in web search tool in Agno 2.0.4 with a Python function in 2025","timestamp":19822},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":19822},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XhhZvj54GSZydJvNoTVmNt","status":"completed","timestamp":19822},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about using the built-in web search tool in Agno 2.0.4 with Python.\n\n## How to Use the Built-in Web Search Tool in Agno 2.0.4\n\nAgno is a lightweight, open-source Python framework for building AI agents.

Docker's iptables chains are placed **in front of** UFW's chains, meaning UFW rules are completely bypassed for Docker container traffic. When you publish container ports (e.g., `-p 8080:80`), those ports become accessible from external networks even if UFW is configured to block them.\n\n## Solution: Modify `/etc/ufw/after.rules`\n\nThe recommended fix is to add custom rules to `/etc/ufw/after.rules` that integrate UFW with Docker's `DOCKER-USER` chain. Add the following at the **end** of the file:\n\n```bash\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [0:0]\n:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [0:0]\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] \"\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\nAfter adding these rules, restart UFW:\n```bash\nsudo ufw reload\n# Or if that doesn't work:\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n```\n\n## What These Rules Do\n\n1. **Redirect Docker traffic through UFW**: Traffic goes through `ufw-user-forward` chain first\n2. **Allow private networks**: Traffic from internal networks (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) is allowed so containers can communicate with each other\n3. **Allow DNS responses**: UDP traffic from port 53 is allowed for DNS resolution\n4. **Block external access to private ranges**: Blocks external SYN packets to private IP ranges\n5. **Log blocked traffic**: Logs denied Docker traffic with `[UFW DOCKER BLOCK]` prefix\n\n## Alternative: Use `ufw-docker` Tool\n\nYou can use the **[chaifeng/ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker)** utility which automates this configuration:\n\n```bash\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\nsudo ufw-docker install\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n```\n\nThen manage container access:\n```bash\n# Allow external access to container port\nsudo ufw-docker allow container_name 80/tcp\n\n# Delete a rule\nsudo ufw-docker delete allow container_name 80/tcp\n```\n\n## Alternative: Bind to Localhost Only\n\nIf you use a reverse proxy (like nginx), bind container ports to localhost only:\n\n```yaml\n# docker-compose.yml\nports:\n  - \"127.0.0.1:8080:80\"  # Only accessible locally\n```\n\nThen let your reverse proxy (running on the host or with proper UFW rules) handle external traffic.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- If UFW rules don't take effect after reload, **reboot the server**\n- Docker's `iptables: false` option in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` is **not recommended** as it breaks container networking\n- The solution works by moving UFW's filtering into the `DOCKER-USER` chain, which Docker preserves across container restarts","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?","timestamp":25002},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":25002},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019YZYA6A5cQW6qKHaq4YTJk","status":"completed","timestamp":25002},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive answer on **how to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall** in 2024:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDocker manipulates iptables directly to enable NAT and container networking.

{"id":"websearch-304","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix the lifi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error in solidity 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix the lifi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error in solidity 2026\nNow I have found the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error in the LI.FI contracts. Let me search for more context on how this error is used and how to fix it.\nNow let me search for how `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` is used in actual facet code:\nNow let me search for the current Validatable contract that contains the validation logic:\nI found the source of the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error. Now I have all the information needed to provide a comprehensive answer.\n\n## How to Fix the LI.FI `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` Custom Error in Solidity\n\nThe `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` custom error is defined in the [LI.FI smart contracts](https://github.com/lifinance/contracts) and is thrown when you try to bridge tokens to the same chain you're currently on.\n\n### **Root Cause**\n\nThe error is defined in `src/Errors/GenericErrors.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nerror CannotBridgeToSameNetwork();\n```\n\nIt's triggered in the `Validatable.sol` helper contract's `validateBridgeData` modifier:\n\n```solidity\nmodifier validateBridgeData(ILiFi.BridgeData memory _bridgeData) {\n    if (LibUtil.isZeroAddress(_bridgeData.receiver)) {\n        revert InvalidReceiver();\n    }\n    if (_bridgeData.minAmount == 0) {\n        revert InvalidAmount();\n    }\n    if (_bridgeData.destinationChainId == block.chainid) {\n        revert CannotBridgeToSameNetwork();  // <-- The error is thrown here\n    }\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n### **How to Fix It**\n\n**1. Ensure Different Source and Destination Chains**\n\nThe most common fix is to make sure `destinationChainId` in your `BridgeData` struct is different from the current chain:\n\n```solidity\nILiFi.BridgeData memory bridgeData = ILiFi.BridgeData({\n    transactionId: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp)),\n    bridge: \"stargate\",\n    integrator: \"YourDapp\",\n    referrer: address(0),\n    sendingAssetId: tokenAddress,\n    receiver: recipientAddress,\n    minAmount: amount,\n    destinationChainId: 42161,  // Make sure this is NOT equal to block.chainid\n    hasSourceSwaps: false,\n    hasDestinationCall: false\n});\n```\n\n**2. Add a Pre-Check in Your Code**\n\nBefore calling the LI.FI contract, validate the chain IDs:\n\n```solidity\nfunction bridgeTokens(\n    uint256 _destinationChainId,\n    // ... other params\n) external {\n    // Pre-check to prevent the error\n    if (_destinationChainId == block.chainid) {\n        revert(\"Cannot bridge to same network - use swap instead\");\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with bridge call\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**3. Use Swaps Instead for Same-Chain Operations**\n\nIf you need to exchange tokens on the same chain, use the `GenericSwapFacet` or LI.FI's swap functionality instead of bridging:\n\n```solidity\n// For same-chain swaps, use GenericSwapFacet\nif (sourceChainId == destinationChainId) {\n    // Call swap function instead\n    ILiFi(lifiDiamond).swapTokensGeneric(...);\n} else {\n    // Call bridge function\n    ILiFi(lifiDiamond).startBridgeTokensViaStargate(...);\n}\n```\n\n**4. For SDK/API Users**\n\nIf you're using the LI.FI SDK or API, ensure your `fromChain` and `toChain` parameters are different:\n\n```typescript\n// Using LI.FI SDK\nconst quote = await getQuote({\n    fromAddress: '0x...',\n    fromChain: ChainId.ETH,      // Source chain\n    toChain: ChainId.ARB,        // Must be different from fromChain\n    fromToken: '0x...',\n    toToken: '0x...',\n    fromAmount: '1000000000000000000',\n});\n```\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error is a **design protection** in LI.FI contracts that prevents users from wasting gas on bridge operations that don't make sense. The fix is to:\n\n1. Use a different `destinationChainId` than the current `block.chainid`\n2. For same-chain token exchanges, use swap functions instead of bridge functions\n3.

This provides better flexibility and avoids common schema cache issues:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(params JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB)\nRETURNS TABLE (product_id INT, final_price DECIMAL)\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n  RETURN QUERY\n  SELECT \n    p.id,\n    COALESCE(\n      (params->'overrides'->>(p.id::TEXT))::DECIMAL,\n      p.base_price\n    ) AS final_price\n  FROM products p\n  WHERE \n    (params->>'product_ids' IS NULL \n     OR p.id = ANY(ARRAY(SELECT jsonb_array_elements_text(params->'product_ids')::INT)));\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n**Call from JavaScript client:**\n```javascript\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  params: {\n    product_ids: [1, 2, 3],\n    overrides: { \"1\": 9.99, \"2\": 14.99 }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### 2. **Handle NULL with COALESCE and Conditional Logic**\n\nAlways use `COALESCE` or explicit `IS NULL` checks for optional parameters:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_products_with_overrides(\n  p_category_id INT DEFAULT NULL,\n  p_override_prices JSONB DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS TABLE (id INT, name TEXT, price DECIMAL)\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n  RETURN QUERY\n  SELECT \n    p.id,\n    p.name,\n    COALESCE(\n      (p_override_prices->>p.id::TEXT)::DECIMAL,\n      p.base_price\n    )\n  FROM products p\n  WHERE (p_category_id IS NULL OR p.category_id = p_category_id);\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n### 3. **For Native Array Parameters, Use Proper Defaults**\n\nIf you must use native PostgreSQL arrays:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_bulk_pricing(\n  p_product_ids INT[] DEFAULT '{}'::INT[],\n  p_new_prices DECIMAL[] DEFAULT '{}'::DECIMAL[]\n)\nRETURNS VOID AS $$\nBEGIN\n  -- Use array_length check for optional behavior\n  IF array_length(p_product_ids, 1) IS NULL THEN\n    RETURN;

A watch page is a page where the **primary purpose is watching a video**. When you embed a YouTube video in a blog post, Google sees the video as secondary/supplementary content, not the main focus—hence the \"Video isn't on a watch page\" error.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. **Understand That This May Be Expected Behavior**\n- If your blog post's main content is text with an embedded YouTube video as supplementary material, Google will correctly report it's \"not on a watch page\"\n- This is **not necessarily a problem**—your blog post can still be indexed; it just won't appear in video-specific search results\n- The YouTube video itself is already indexed on YouTube's platform\n\n### 2. **Create Dedicated Watch Pages (If Video Visibility Matters)**\nIf you want your video to appear in Google's video search results:\n- Create a **separate dedicated page** where the video is the main content\n- The page should focus primarily on showing the video\n- Keep only one video per watch page\n- You can still embed the same video in your blog post separately\n\n### 3. **Add VideoObject Structured Data (Schema Markup)**\nAdd JSON-LD schema to help Google understand your video:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"A brief description of the video.\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-30T08:00:00+00:00\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Submit a Video Sitemap**\nCreate and submit a video sitemap to Google Search Console to help Google discover and index your videos faster.\n\n### 5. **Remove Conflicting Schema**\nIf your page has Article schema, it may conflict with video indexing.

Set Up Your Webhook Endpoint in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to the **Webhooks** page in your Clerk Dashboard\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your webhook URL (e.g., `https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/clerk`)\n4. In **Subscribe to events**, select:\n   - `organization.created`\n   - `organization.updated`\n   - `organization.deleted`\n5. Click **Create** and copy the **Signing Secret**\n\n### 2. Configure Environment Variables\n\n```env\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_your_signing_secret_here\n```\n\n### 3. Make the Webhook Route Public\n\nIn your middleware, ensure the webhook route is public (unauthenticated):\n\n```typescript\n// middleware.ts\nimport { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'\n\nexport default clerkMiddleware({\n  publicRoutes: ['/api/webhooks(.*)']\n})\n```\n\n### 4. Create the Webhook Handler (Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n    \n    const eventType = evt.type\n\n    switch (eventType) {\n      case 'organization.created': {\n        const { id, name, slug, created_at, public_metadata, private_metadata } = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization created: ${name} (${id})`)\n        \n        // Example: Create organization in your database\n        // await db.organization.create({\n        //   data: {\n        //     clerkOrgId: id,\n        //     name,\n        //     slug,\n        //     createdAt: new Date(created_at),\n        //   }\n        // })\n        break\n      }\n\n      case 'organization.updated': {\n        const { id, name, slug, updated_at, public_metadata, private_metadata } = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization updated: ${name} (${id})`)\n        \n        // Example: Update organization in your database\n        // await db.organization.update({\n        //   where: { clerkOrgId: id },\n        //   data: {\n        //     name,\n        //     slug,\n        //     updatedAt: new Date(updated_at),\n        //   }\n        // })\n        break\n      }\n\n      case 'organization.deleted': {\n        const { id } = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization deleted: ${id}`)\n        \n        // Example: Delete or soft-delete organization in your database\n        // await db.organization.update({\n        //   where: { clerkOrgId: id },\n        //   data: { deleted: true, deletedAt: new Date() }\n        // })\n        // Or hard delete:\n        // await db.organization.delete({ where: { clerkOrgId: id } })\n        break\n      }\n\n      default:\n        console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${eventType}`)\n    }\n\n    return NextResponse.json({ success: true }, { status: 200 })\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Webhook verification failed:', err)\n    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Webhook verification failed' }, { status: 400 })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Example Payload Structures\n\n**organization.created / organization.updated:**\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"org_abc123\",\n    \"name\": \"Acme Corp\",\n    \"slug\": \"acme-corp\",\n    \"image_url\": \"https://img.clerk.com/...\",\n    \"created_at\": 1704067200000,\n    \"updated_at\": 1704067200000,\n    \"public_metadata\": {},\n    \"private_metadata\": {},\n    \"max_allowed_memberships\": 5\n  },\n  \"object\": \"event\",\n  \"type\": \"organization.created\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1704067200000,\n  \"instance_id\": \"ins_xxx\"\n}\n```\n\n**organization.deleted:**\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"org_abc123\",\n    \"object\": \"organization\",\n    \"deleted\": true\n  },\n  \"object\": \"event\",\n  \"type\": \"organization.deleted\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1704067200000,\n  \"instance_id\": \"ins_xxx\"\n}\n```\n\n### 6. TypeScript Types for Organization Events\n\nImport these types from `@clerk/nextjs/webhooks`:\n\n```typescript\nimport type { \n  OrganizationJSON, \n  DeletedObjectJSON,\n  WebhookEvent \n} from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\n```\n\n### 7. Testing Locally with ngrok\n\n1. Install and run ngrok: `ngrok http 3000`\n2. Copy the forwarding URL\n3. Add it to your Clerk webhook endpoint (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk`)\n4. Use the **Testing** tab in Clerk Dashboard to send test events\n\n### Key Best Practices for 2026:\n\n1. **Always verify webhooks** using `verifyWebhook()` - never trust unverified payloads\n2. **Return 2xx status codes** for successful processing (webhooks retry on 4xx/5xx)\n3. **Handle retries idempotently** - use the event ID to prevent duplicate processing\n4. **Log webhook events** for debugging failed deliveries\n5. **Use eventually consistent patterns** - webhooks may be delayed; don't rely on them for synchronous flows","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","timestamp":40202},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":40202},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YKARzkqf7hC2j6Ur8w39nW","status":"completed","timestamp":40202},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about handling Clerk organization webhook events:","timestamp":40202},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Dp2N7jRnp726aP5HKBbupL","status":"completed","timestamp":40202},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":40202},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015RvV8HZ8BrRkmsm5Ys827P","status":"completed","timestamp":40202},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search specifically for organization webhook events handling:","timestamp":40202},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01DuNAEWwet8R7Q1WZapTAZ3","status":"completed","timestamp":40202},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive answer on how to handle Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` in 2026:\n\n---\n\n## How to Handle Clerk Organization Webhook Events in 2026\n\n### 1.

Let me provide a complete answer about using KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Using KSP for i18n Code Generation in Kotlin Multiplatform (2026)\n\nIn 2026, **KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)** has become the standard for annotation processing in Kotlin Multiplatform, with KAPT deprecated and KSP2 being the default since 2025. Here are the main approaches for i18n code generation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Lyricist** (KSP-based, Compose Multiplatform)\n\nLyricist is a pure Kotlin i18n/L10n library specifically designed for Compose Multiplatform that uses **KSP 2.0**:\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\") version \"2.3.3\" // Match your Kotlin version\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist:x.x.x\")\n    ksp(\"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor:x.x.x\")\n}\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```kotlin\n// Define type-safe strings\ndata class Strings(\n    val greeting: String,\n    val itemCount: (count: Int) -> String // Type-safe parameters!\n)\n\n@LyricistStrings(languageTag = \"en\")\nval EnStrings = Strings(\n    greeting = \"Hello\",\n    itemCount = { count -> \"$count items\" }\n)\n\n// Access in Compose\nval lyricist = rememberLyricist()\nText(lyricist.strings.greeting)\n```\n\n**KSP Options:**\n```kotlin\nksp {\n    arg(\"lyricist.generateStringsProperty\", \"true\") // Generate `strings` shorthand\n    arg(\"lyricist.internalVisibility\", \"true\")      // Internal visibility\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **MOKO Resources** (Gradle Plugin + Code Generation)\n\nMOKO Resources uses a Gradle plugin (not KSP directly) but generates type-safe accessors using **KotlinPoet**:\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts (root)\nplugins {\n    id(\"dev.icerock.mobile.multiplatform-resources\") version \"0.24.x\"\n}\n\n// shared/build.gradle.kts\nmultiplatformResources {\n    multiplatformResourcesPackage = \"com.example.app\"\n}\n```\n\n**Define strings in XML:**\n```xml\n<!-- commonMain/resources/MR/base/strings.xml -->\n<resources>\n    <string name=\"app_name\">MyApp</string>\n    <string name=\"welcome_user\">Welcome, %s!</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n**Use generated code:**\n```kotlin\n// Type-safe access\nval appName = MR.strings.app_name.desc()\nval welcome = MR.strings.welcome_user.format(\"John\")\n\n// Compose Multiplatform\nText(stringResource(MR.strings.app_name))\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **i18n4k** (Code Generator + Multiplatform)\n\nA multiplatform library with its own Gradle plugin for code generation:\n\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    id(\"de.comahe.i18n4k\") version \"x.x.x\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core:x.x.x\")\n}\n```\n\n**Define messages:**\n```properties\n# src/commonMain/i18n/Messages.properties\nhello=Hello\nwelcome=Welcome, {0}!\n```\n\n**Generated type-safe code:**\n```kotlin\nobject Messages : MessagesBundle {\n    val hello: LocalizedString\n    fun welcome(arg0: Any): LocalizedString\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Custom KSP Processor** (DIY Approach)\n\nFor full control, build your own KSP processor:\n\n```kotlin\n// processor/build.gradle.kts\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"com.google.devtools.ksp:symbol-processing-api:2.3.3\")\n    implementation(\"com.squareup:kotlinpoet:1.x.x\")\n    implementation(\"com.squareup:kotlinpoet-ksp:1.x.x\")\n}\n\n// Define your annotation\n@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)\nannotation class Localized\n\n// Processor\nclass LocalizationProcessor(\n    private val codeGenerator: CodeGenerator,\n    private val logger: KSPLogger\n) : SymbolProcessor {\n    override fun process(resolver: Resolver): List<KSAnnotated> {\n        resolver.getSymbolsWithAnnotation(\"com.example.Localized\")\n            .filterIsInstance<KSClassDeclaration>()\n            .forEach { generateStrings(it) }\n        return emptyList()\n    }\n    \n    private fun generateStrings(classDecl: KSClassDeclaration) {\n        // Use KotlinPoet to generate type-safe string accessors\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**KSP Multiplatform configuration:**\n```kotlin\n// For all targets\ndependencies {\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", project(\":processor\"))\n    add(\"kspAndroid\", project(\":processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosArm64\", project(\":processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosSimulatorArm64\", project(\":processor\"))\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations for 2026\n\n| Aspect | Recommendation |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **KSP Version** | Use KSP2 (2.3.x+) — KSP1 is incompatible with Kotlin 2.3+ |\n| **Multiplatform** | Add `ksp<Target>` dependencies for each platform |\n| **Compose** | Lyricist is the most

Use center points of bounding boxes as positive prompts\n  - Apply **Uniform Ray Points** strategy for better spatial coverage\n  - Generate points in multiple regions within the bounding box for richer spatial information\n\n### 4. **Learnable Prompt Generation (PPN Approach)**\n- Use **Prompt Prediction Networks (PPN)** with learnable tokens and positional encoding\n- First two refined tokens predict bounding box coordinates\n- Remaining tokens serve as high-dimensional prompts for boundary refinement\n\n### 5. **Boundary-Preserving Visual Prompts**\n- Research from January 2026 shows models are more resilient when **structural boundary information is preserved** in visual prompts\n- Dilated prompts outperform eroded ones for maintaining segmentation performance\n- Include explicit spatial constraints in prompts for optimal results\n\n### 6. **Vertex AI Specific Techniques**\n- Leverage Vertex AI's **multimodal generative techniques** with Gemini models\n- Use the prompt design patterns from Google's skill badge curriculum:\n  -

are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?\nBased on the search results, here are the **2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key Guidelines for Android Inset Handling (2026)\n\n### 1. **Mandatory Edge-to-Edge (Android 15+)**\n- Starting from **Android 15 (API 35)**, edge-to-edge design is **mandatory** for apps targeting SDK 35 or above\n- Apps must handle insets using the **WindowInsets APIs** (for Views) or **`systemBarsPadding()`** (for Compose)\n- Content now extends behind system bars by default\n\n### 2. **WindowInsets API Usage**\nFor **XML/View-based layouts**:\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n    v.updateLayoutParams<MarginLayoutParams> {\n        leftMargin = insets.left\n        bottomMargin = insets.bottom\n        rightMargin = insets.right\n        topMargin = insets.top\n    }\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\nFor **Jetpack Compose**:\n- Use `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.safeDrawing)` for content that shouldn't be obscured\n- Use `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.safeGestures)` to prevent system gesture conflicts\n- `Scaffold` provides `innerPadding` automatically that handles system bar insets\n\n### 3. **Gesture Navigation Insets**\n- **System gesture insets** identify gesture-navigational areas used by the system that take priority over your app\n- For gesture navigation, apps must respect navigation insets to avoid placing critical buttons or gestures in conflict zones\n- The gesture navigation bar area requires special handling with `safe-area-inset-bottom` (for web) or `navigationBarsPadding()` (for Compose)\n\n### 4. **Key Inset Types**\n| Inset Type | Purpose |\n|------------|---------|\n| `WindowInsets.systemBars` | Status bar + navigation bar |\n| `WindowInsets.safeDrawing` | Prevents content from being obscured |\n| `WindowInsets.safeGestures` | Prevents system gesture conflicts |\n| `WindowInsets.safeContent` | Combination of safeDrawing + safeGestures |\n| `WindowInsets.displayCutout` | Areas with screen cutouts (notches) |\n\n### 5. **Best Practices**\n- **Consume insets once** to prevent double-application (common cause of UI glitches)\n- For scrolling lists, ensure the last item doesn't fall under the gesture handle by adding content insets\n- Components like `BottomNavigationView` and `BottomAppBar` often auto-apply insets—avoid adding extra handling\n- Use `enableEdgeToEdge()` API for simplified backwards-compatibility\n- For 3-button navigation (taller than gesture bar), ensure adequate bottom padding so content doesn't overlap\n\n### 6. **For Web (Chrome on Android)**\nUse CSS environment variables:\n```css\npadding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);\npadding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);\n```\n\nThese guidelines ensure apps render correctly across different navigation modes (gesture vs. 3-button), screen cutouts, and system bar configurations while providing an immersive edge-to-edge experience.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?\nLet me search for more detailed information about the HumanInterrupt types specifically:\nNow let me search for more details on HumanInterrupt types and ActionRequest:\nNow let me fetch the official LangChain documentation for more details:\nNow I have comprehensive information about LangGraph human interrupt and resume functionality. Let me provide a complete answer:\n\n---\n\n## How to Use LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume in Python with HumanInterrupt Types and the Command Object\n\n### Overview\n\nLangGraph provides powerful human-in-the-loop (HITL) capabilities through the `interrupt()` function and `Command` object. This allows you to pause graph execution at critical points, wait for human input, and then resume with the provided response.\n\n### Core Components\n\n#### 1. **Basic Interrupt Function**\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    user_feedback: str\n\ndef human_feedback(state):\n    # This pauses execution and waits for input\n    feedback = interrupt(\"Please provide feedback:\")\n    return {\"user_feedback\": feedback}\n\n# Build graph with checkpointer (REQUIRED for interrupts)\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"human_feedback\", human_feedback)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"human_feedback\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"human_feedback\", END)\n\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n```\n\n#### 2. **Running and Resuming**\n```python\n# Run until interrupt\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": \"hello\"}, config=config)\n# Output shows: {'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='Please provide feedback:'),)}\n\n# Resume with human input using Command\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\nfinal_result = graph.invoke(Command(resume=\"approved!\"), config=config)\n```\n\n### HumanInterrupt Types (Structured Interrupts)\n\nFor more complex workflows, LangGraph provides typed interrupt schemas:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Optional\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\nclass HumanInterruptConfig(TypedDict, total=False):\n    allow_accept: bool      # Allow accepting the action as-is\n    allow_edit: bool        # Allow editing the arguments\n    allow_respond: bool     # Allow text feedback response\n    allow_ignore: bool      # Allow skipping this step\n\nclass ActionRequest(TypedDict):\n    action: str             # The action being requested (e.g., tool name)\n    args: dict              # Arguments for the action\n\nclass HumanInterrupt(TypedDict):\n    action_request: ActionRequest\n    config: HumanInterruptConfig\n    description: str\n```\n\n#### Full Example with HumanInterrupt Types:\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents.interrupt import HumanInterrupt, ActionRequest, HumanInterruptConfig\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef tool_with_approval(state):\n    # Create structured interrupt request\n    request: HumanInterrupt = {\n        \"action_request\": ActionRequest(\n            action=\"run_command\",\n            args={\"command\": \"ls\", \"args\": [\"-l\"]}\n        ),\n        \"config\": HumanInterruptConfig(\n            allow_ignore=True,\n            allow_respond=True,\n            allow_edit=False,\n            allow_accept=True\n        ),\n        \"description\": \"Please review the command before execution\"\n    }\n    \n    # Send interrupt and get response\n    response = interrupt([request])[0]\n    \n    # Handle different response types\n    if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n        # Execute with original args\n        return execute_tool(request[\"action_request\"][\"args\"])\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n        # Execute with edited args\n        edited_args = response[\"args\"][\"args\"]\n        return execute_tool(edited_args)\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"response\":\n        # Handle text feedback\n        return {\"feedback\": response[\"args\"]}\n```\n\n### Using Command for Dynamic Routing\n\nThe `Command` object supports both resuming and dynamic graph navigation:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\nfrom typing import Literal\n\ndef human_approval(state) -> Command[Literal[\"approved_path\", \"rejected_path\"]]:\n    decision = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"Do you approve this output?\",\n        \"llm_output\": state[\"llm_output\"]\n    })\n    \n    if decision == \"approve\":\n        return Command(goto=\"approved_path\", update={\"decision\": \"approved\"})\n    else:\n        return Command(goto=\"rejected_path\", update={\"decision\": \"rejected\"})\n```\n\n### Common Patterns\n\n#### Pattern 1: Approve/Reject Tool Calls\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent\n\ndef book_hotel(hotel_name: str):\n    \"\"\"Book a hotel -

This allows you to pause graph execution at critical points, wait for human input, and then resume with the provided response.\n\n### Core Components\n\n#### 1. **Basic Interrupt Function**\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    user_feedback: str\n\ndef human_feedback(state):\n    # This pauses execution and waits for input\n    feedback = interrupt(\"Please provide feedback:\")\n    return {\"user_feedback\": feedback}\n\n# Build graph with checkpointer (REQUIRED for interrupts)\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"human_feedback\", human_feedback)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"human_feedback\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"human_feedback\", END)\n\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n```\n\n#### 2. **Running and Resuming**\n```python\n# Run until interrupt\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": \"hello\"}, config=config)\n# Output shows: {'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='Please provide feedback:'),)}\n\n# Resume with human input using Command\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\nfinal_result = graph.invoke(Command(resume=\"approved!\"), config=config)\n```\n\n### HumanInterrupt Types (Structured Interrupts)\n\nFor more complex workflows, LangGraph provides typed interrupt schemas:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Optional\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\nclass HumanInterruptConfig(TypedDict, total=False):\n    allow_accept: bool      # Allow accepting the action as-is\n    allow_edit: bool        # Allow editing the arguments\n    allow_respond: bool     # Allow text feedback response\n    allow_ignore: bool      # Allow skipping this step\n\nclass ActionRequest(TypedDict):\n    action: str             # The action being requested (e.g., tool name)\n    args: dict              # Arguments for the action\n\nclass HumanInterrupt(TypedDict):\n    action_request: ActionRequest\n    config: HumanInterruptConfig\n    description: str\n```\n\n#### Full Example with HumanInterrupt Types:\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents.interrupt import HumanInterrupt, ActionRequest, HumanInterruptConfig\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef tool_with_approval(state):\n    # Create structured interrupt request\n    request: HumanInterrupt = {\n        \"action_request\": ActionRequest(\n            action=\"run_command\",\n            args={\"command\": \"ls\", \"args\": [\"-l\"]}\n        ),\n        \"config\": HumanInterruptConfig(\n            allow_ignore=True,\n            allow_respond=True,\n            allow_edit=False,\n            allow_accept=True\n        ),\n        \"description\": \"Please review the command before execution\"\n    }\n    \n    # Send interrupt and get response\n    response = interrupt([request])[0]\n    \n    # Handle different response types\n    if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n        # Execute with original args\n        return execute_tool(request[\"action_request\"][\"args\"])\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n        # Execute with edited args\n        edited_args = response[\"args\"][\"args\"]\n        return execute_tool(edited_args)\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"response\":\n        # Handle text feedback\n        return {\"feedback\": response[\"args\"]}\n```\n\n### Using Command for Dynamic Routing\n\nThe `Command` object supports both resuming and dynamic graph navigation:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\nfrom typing import Literal\n\ndef human_approval(state) -> Command[Literal[\"approved_path\", \"rejected_path\"]]:\n    decision = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"Do you approve this output?\",\n        \"llm_output\": state[\"llm_output\"]\n    })\n    \n    if decision == \"approve\":\n        return Command(goto=\"approved_path\", update={\"decision\": \"approved\"})\n    else:\n        return Command(goto=\"rejected_path\", update={\"decision\": \"rejected\"})\n```\n\n### Common Patterns\n\n#### Pattern 1: Approve/Reject Tool Calls\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent\n\ndef book_hotel(hotel_name: str):\n    \"\"\"Book a hotel - requires human approval\"\"\"\n    response = interrupt(\n        f\"Trying to call `book_hotel` with args {{'hotel_name': {hotel_name}}}. \"\n        \"Please approve or suggest edits.\"\n    )\n    \n    if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n        pass  # Use original args\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n        hotel_name = response[\"args\"][\"hotel_name\"]\n    \n    return f\"Successfully booked at {hotel_name}.\"\n\n# Resume with approval\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume={\"type\": \"accept\"}), config)\n\n# Or resume with edits\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume={\"type\": \"edit\", \"args\": {\"hotel_name\": \"New Hotel\"}}), config)\n```\n\n#### Pattern 2: Review and Edit State\n```python\ndef human_review_edit(state):\n    result = interrupt({\n        \"task\": \"Please review and edit the summary if necessary.\",\n        \"generated_summary\": state[\"summary\"]\n    })\n    return {\"summary\": result[\"edited_summary\"]}\n\n# Resume with edited content\ngraph.invoke(\n    Command(resume={\"edited_summary\": \"The corrected summary text.\"}),\n    config\n)\n```\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n1. **Checkpointer is mandatory**: Always use a checkpointer (e.g., `InMemorySaver`, `AsyncPostgresSaver`) for interrupts to work\n2. **Thread ID required**: Pass a `thread_id` in config to associate execution with a conversation\n3. **Idempotent side effects**: Code before `interrupt()` may re-run on resume, so keep operations idempotent\n4. **Consistent interrupt order**: Keep `interrupt()` calls in the same order across node executions\n\n### Response Types\n\nWhen handling structured interrupts, responses typically include:\n\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `accept` | Accept the action with original arguments |\n| `edit` | Accept with modified arguments (args in `response[\"args\"]`) |\n| `response` | Provide text feedback instead of executing |\n| `ignore` | Skip this step entirely |\n\nThis provides a complete framework for building production-ready human-in-the-loop AI agents with LangGraph.","timestamp":62455}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"LangGraph","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769683593418,"end":1769683655873,"firstResponse":62455,"sessionCreation":0,"total":62455},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.86,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

If CUDA is initialized in the parent process before spawning children, it can cause deadlocks\n2. **Wrong start method** - Using `fork` (Linux default) instead of `spawn` with CUDA\n3. **GIL contention** - Python's Global Interpreter Lock blocking within CUDA APIs\n4. **Shared memory issues** - Improper handling of GPU tensors across process boundaries\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. **Use `spawn` Start Method (Most Important)**\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)  # Critical for CUDA\n    main()\n```\n\n### 2. **Load Models Inside Child Processes, Not Parent**\n```python\ndef worker(rank):\n    # Load model INSIDE the worker, not in parent\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    model = torch.load(\"model.pt\", map_location=f\"cuda:{rank}\")\n    # ... training code\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    mp.spawn(worker, args=(), nprocs=num_gpus)\n```\n\n### 3. **Avoid CUDA Calls Before Spawning**\n```python\n# BAD -

Set Proper Environment Variables**\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"TORCH_NCCL_ENABLE_MONITORING\"] = \"0\"  # Disable if causing hangs\nos.environ[\"TORCH_NCCL_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SEC\"] = \"1800\"  # Increase timeout\n```\n\n### 6. **Guard Entry Points**\n```python\n# Always use this guard on Windows/macOS (required) and Linux (recommended)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    # Your code here\n```\n\n### 7. **For DataLoader with num_workers > 0**\n```python\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\nloader = DataLoader(\n    dataset,\n    num_workers=4,\n    pin_memory=True,\n    persistent_workers=True,  # Avoid respawning overhead\n    multiprocessing_context=\"spawn\"  # Force spawn context\n)\n```\n\n### 8. **Load to CPU First, Then Move to GPU**\n```python\ndef worker(rank):\n    # Load to CPU first\n    state_dict = torch.load(\"model.pt\", map_location=\"cpu\")\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.load_state_dict(state_dict)\n    # Then move to specific GPU\n    model = model.to(f\"cuda:{rank}\")\n```\n\n## Quick Debugging Checklist\n\n| Issue | Fix |\n|-------|-----|\n| Hangs on `torch.load` | Use `spawn`, load inside worker |\n| NCCL timeout | Increase `TORCH_NCCL_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SEC` |\n| Deadlock with DataLoader | Set `multiprocessing_context=\"spawn\"` |\n| Works on Linux, fails on Windows | Add `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard |\n| GPU memory stuck | Load to CPU first, then `.to(device)` |\n\n## Summary\n\nThe most common fix for model loading deadlocks in multiprocessing is:\n\n1. **Always use `spawn`** start method with CUDA\n2. **Load models inside worker processes**, not the parent\n3. **Guard your entry point** with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`\n4. **Avoid any CUDA calls** before spawning processes","timestamp":35661}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"PyTorch","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769683728515,"end":1769683764176,"firstResponse":35661,"sessionCreation":0,"total":35661},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":false,"score":0,"reasoning":"Execution timed out","metadata":{"mcpToolCalled":false,"expectedMcp":true,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":true}}}

Here's the summary:\n\n## Langfuse Vulnerability Details\n\n### CVE-2025-7783 (form-data Library)\n- **Severity:** Critical\n- **Affected Library:** form-data (JavaScript/npm package)\n- **Affected Versions:** < 2.5.4, 3.0.0 - 3.0.3, 4.0.0 - 4.0.3\n- **Vulnerability Type:** Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE-330) leading to HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)\n- **Description:** The form-data library uses `Math.random()` to generate boundary values for multipart form-encoded data. This implementation is predictable when an attacker can observe sequential values from the same pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) state. An attacker who can predict the boundary value can craft payloads that inject malicious parameters into HTTP requests, potentially enabling:\n  - Multipart injection attacks\n  - Manipulation or overwriting of server-side fields\n  - Unauthorized internal requests\n  - Data exfiltration\n- **EPSS Score:** ~4.87%\n- **Impact on Langfuse:** Affects Langfuse Worker Docker Image through dependencies like `@langchain/openai`, `@slack/web-api`, and `@google-cloud/storage`\n- **Fixed Versions:** form-data 2.5.4+, 3.0.4+, 4.0.4+\n- **PoC Available:** Yes (https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc)\n\n---\n\n### CVE-2025-58754 (Axios Library)\n- **Severity:** High (CVSS 7.5)\n- **Affected Library:** Axios (JavaScript/npm HTTP client)\n- **Affected Versions:** < 0.30.2 and < 1.12.0 (originally noted as < 1.11.0)\n- **Vulnerability Type:** Denial of Service (DoS) via unbounded memory allocation (CWE-770)\n- **Description:** When Axios runs on Node.js and processes URLs with the `data:` scheme, it decodes the entire payload into memory without enforcing size limits. This behavior bypasses `maxContentLength` and `maxBodyLength` protections (which only apply to HTTP responses). An attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI, causing the Node.js process to allocate unbounded memory and crash, even when `responseType: 'stream'` is specified.\n- **Attack Vector:** Network-based, no privileges required\n- **Impact:** Server crash/denial of service\n- **Fixed Version:** Axios 1.12.0\n- **Mitigation:** \n  - Upgrade to Axios 1.12.0+\n  - Avoid processing untrusted `data:` URIs\n  - Implement size checks before processing data URLs\n\n---\n\n### CVE-2024-37890 (ws WebSocket Library)\n- **Severity:** High (CVSS 7.5)\n- **Affected Library:** ws (Node.js WebSocket client/server)\n- **Affected Versions:** < 5.2.4, < 6.2.3, < 7.5.10, < 8.17.1\n- **Vulnerability Type:** Denial of Service (DoS) via NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476) / Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)\n- **Description:** A request with a number of headers exceeding the `server.maxHeadersCount` threshold can crash a ws server. When this limit is exceeded, `incomingMessage.headers.upgrade` may not be set, leading to a crash when the ws library attempts to read this undefined property.\n- **Attack Vector:** Network-based, no authentication required\n- **Impact:** WebSocket server crash/denial of service\n- **Fixed Versions:**\n  - ws@8.17.1 (commit e55e510)\n  - ws@7.5.10 (commit 22c2876)\n  - ws@6.2.3 (commit eeb76d3)\n  - ws@5.2.4 (commit 4abd8f6)\n- **Workarounds:**\n  1. Reduce maximum allowed header length using `--max-http-header-size=size` or `maxHeaderSize` options\n  2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to 0 to disable the limit\n\n---\n\n### Context for Langfuse\nThese vulnerabilities were reported in Langfuse Docker images (web and worker) starting around version 3.11+. The affected packages are transitive dependencies pulled in through:\n- `@langchain/openai` → `openai` → `@types/node-fetch` → `form-data`\n- `@slack/web-api` → `axios`\n- Various WebSocket-related components using `ws`\n\nLangfuse users running self-hosted deployments should monitor for updates that bump these dependencies to their patched versions.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the details for Langfuse vulnerabilities CVE-2025-7783, CVE-2025-58754, and CVE-2024-37890?","timestamp":39102},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":39102},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Y4mwr9NFPQaCYk6MMthz3r","status":"completed","timestamp":39102},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific details on each CVE:","timestamp":39102},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011SDXyGg5yxRKdMtWwMyajc","status":"completed","timestamp":39102},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01JaJKU6TLs92ATaX43xK2aF","status":"completed","timestamp":39102},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for the CVE-2025-58754 Axios vulnerability:","timestamp":39102},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SFuYscj4AdV8775Dj14ccX","status":"completed","timestamp":39102},{"type":"message","content":"I now have comprehensive information on all three CVEs.

{"id":"websearch-1041","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive answer about Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026:\n\n## Common Causes of Go Version Compatibility Errors in govulncheck\n\n### 1. **Go Version Mismatch Between Installed Go and go.mod**\nThe most common issue occurs when the `go` directive in `go.mod` specifies a version different from your installed Go toolchain. Since Go 1.21, the `go` line in `go.mod` is a **mandatory requirement** rather than an advisory suggestion.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Update your Go installation to match or exceed the version in `go.mod`\n- Use `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` to allow automatic toolchain switching:\n  ```bash\n  go env -w GOTOOLCHAIN=auto\n  ```\n- Or specify a specific toolchain: `go env -w GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26+auto`\n\n### 2. **GOEXPERIMENT Compatibility Issues**\nIn Go 1.25+, using experimental features like `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` can cause govulncheck to panic when scanning code that imports `encoding/json` or uses experimental JSON libraries.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Temporarily disable the experiment when running govulncheck:\n  ```bash\n  GOEXPERIMENT= govulncheck ./...\n  ```\n- Update to the latest govulncheck version which may include fixes\n\n### 3. **Binary Mode Incompatibilities**\nWhen scanning binaries built with a different Go version than the one running govulncheck, version detection issues can occur.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Ensure govulncheck is built with a Go version equal to or newer than the binary being scanned\n- Use source mode (`govulncheck ./...`) instead of binary mode when possible\n\n### 4. **Missing Go Binary in PATH**\ngovulncheck expects a `go` binary to exist and calls it frequently. This is problematic in some distribution setups where Go versions are aliased differently.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Ensure `go` is available in your PATH\n- Set `GO_CMD` environment variable if using non-standard Go binary names\n- Verify with `which go` or `go version`\n\n### 5. **Invalid go.mod Version Format**\nThe `go` directive must follow the format `1.x` (e.g., `go 1.26`). Invalid formats cause parsing errors.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Ensure your `go.mod` uses valid version syntax:\n  ```\n  go 1.26\n  toolchain go1.26.0\n  ```\n\n### 6. **Third-Party Dependencies Using Experimental Features**\nSome libraries (like `github.com/go-json-experiment/json`) can cause govulncheck to panic due to type system incompatibilities.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Update dependencies to stable versions\n- Wait for upstream fixes or use alternative libraries\n- Check GitHub issues for known compatibility problems\n\n## Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Use GOTOOLCHAIN=auto**: This allows Go to automatically download and use the correct toolchain version specified in your module.\n\n2. **Keep govulncheck updated**: Install the latest version regularly:\n   ```bash\n   go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest\n   ```\n\n3. **Specify toolchain in go.mod**: For Go 1.21+, explicitly set the toolchain:\n   ```\n   go 1.26\n   toolchain go1.26.0\n   ```\n\n4. **Add to CI/CD pipelines**: Run govulncheck in your build pipelines to catch issues early:\n   ```yaml\n   - run: govulncheck ./...\n   ```\n\n5. **Check version compatibility**: Before running, verify versions match:\n   ```bash\n   go version\n   govulncheck -version\n   ```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","timestamp":32524},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":32524},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HUa4MDJ68maDjVkcaovb35","status":"completed","timestamp":32524},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019DFzjqnX5hi27uJwpThrsA","status":"completed","timestamp":32524},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012ZZgCDJVdBYusQeeqsRREG","status":"completed","timestamp":32524},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive answer about Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026:\n\n## Common Causes of Go Version Compatibility Errors in govulncheck\n\n### 1. **Go Version Mismatch Between Installed Go and go.mod**\nThe most common issue occurs when the `go` directive in `go.mod` specifies a version different from your installed Go toolchain.

It's perfect for:\n- Writers managing documents\n- Designers tracking design files\n- Anyone who wants better version control than \"file_final_FINAL_v2.docx\"\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop\n\n1. Go to **[desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)**\n2. Download the version for your operating system (Windows or Mac)\n3. Run the installer and follow the prompts\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Create a GitHub Account & Sign In\n\n1. If you don't have one, create a free account at **[github.com](https://github.com)**\n2. Open GitHub Desktop\n3. Go to **File → Options** (Windows) or **GitHub Desktop → Settings** (Mac)\n4. Click **\"Sign Into GitHub.com\"** and follow the authentication steps\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Understand Key Concepts (No Jargon!)\n\n| Term | What It Means |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Repository (Repo)** | A folder that tracks all changes to your files |\n| **Commit** | A \"save point\" - a snapshot of your work with a description |\n| **Push** | Upload your changes to GitHub (the cloud) |\n| **Pull** | Download the latest changes from GitHub |\n| **Branch** | A separate copy to experiment without affecting the main files |\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Create Your First Repository\n\n1. In GitHub Desktop, click **File → New Repository**\n2. Give it a name (e.g., \"my-project\")\n3. Choose a location on your computer\n4. Click **\"Create Repository\"**\n\nNow you have a folder that tracks every change you make!\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Make Changes and Commit Them\n\n1. Add or edit files in your repository folder (use any app - Word, Notepad, etc.)\n2. Open GitHub Desktop - it automatically shows what changed\n3. Write a brief description of what you did (e.g., \"Added chapter 2 draft\")\n4. Click **\"Commit to main\"**\n\n**Pro tip:** Commit often!

are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive answer about common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them:\n\n## Common Causes of 500 Errors in REST API Customer Endpoints\n\n### 1. **Server-Side Code Exceptions**\n- Unhandled exceptions in business logic\n- Null pointer/reference errors when accessing customer data\n- Syntax errors in database queries (e.g., malformed SQL/SOQL)\n- Type mismatches or data conversion failures\n\n### 2. **Database Issues**\n- Connection pool exhaustion\n- Database timeouts or unavailability\n- Query execution failures\n- Data integrity constraint violations\n\n### 3. **Configuration Problems**\n- Incorrect or outdated endpoint URLs\n- Missing environment variables or misconfigured connection strings\n- Production vs. development configuration mismatches\n\n### 4. **Resource Exhaustion**\n- Memory leaks causing out-of-memory errors\n- Thread pool exhaustion\n- Service outages or downstream dependencies failing\n\n### 5. **Authentication/Authorization Backend Failures**\n- Token validation service unavailability\n- Session store connectivity issues\n\n---\n\n## How to Debug 500 Errors in 2026\n\n### 1. **Check Server Logs First**\n- Review application logs for stack traces and error messages\n- Enable debug mode on the backend server to get detailed error information\n- Look for patterns in error timing and frequency\n\n### 2. **Use API Debugging Tools**\n- **Postman** or **cURL** to reproduce the error by calling the API directly\n- Test the same endpoint from different environments to isolate the issue\n- Use API monitoring platforms for real-time error tracking\n\n### 3. **Enable Remote Debugging**\n- For cloud-deployed APIs (e.g., Azure Web Apps), use remote debugging features\n- Attach debuggers to running instances to step through code\n\n### 4. **Implement Centralized Error Handling**\n```javascript\n// Express.js example\napp.use((err, req, res, next) => {\n  const status = err.status || 500;\n  res.status(status).json({\n    error: {\n      message: err.message,\n      code: status,\n      details: err.details || null\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### 5. **Validate Response Status Codes**\n- A 500 error indicates a server problem—review server-side logs for root causes\n- Distinguish between 4xx (client errors) and 5xx (server errors) to narrow down issues\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for Prevention**\n- Use specific error codes when possible (e.g., 404 for \"not found\" instead of generic 500)\n- Return 500 only for truly unexpected conditions like service outages\n- Implement proper exception handling to expose meaningful errors to clients\n- Never return 500 for issues the client can correct\n\n### 7. **Test Backend Services Directly**\n- If using an API gateway, bypass it and call the backend server API directly to isolate where the error originates\n- Verify database connectivity and query execution independently","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors

{"id":"websearch-1267","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial\nNow let me get more detailed content from some of these sources to provide a comprehensive tutorial:\nBased on my research, I now have comprehensive information to provide you with a detailed tutorial on setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo.\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up shadcn UI in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Tutorial)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js** v18 or higher\n- **pnpm** v10 (recommended package manager)\n- **TypeScript** v5+\n- **Next.js** v16\n- **Tailwind CSS** v4\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Create a New Turborepo Project\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\nThis creates a monorepo with:\n- `apps/` - Contains your applications (web, docs)\n- `packages/` - Contains shared packages (ui, eslint-config, typescript-config, tailwind-config)\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Configure the UI Package for shadcn\n\n### 2.1 Navigate to the UI package and create `components.json`\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\ntouch components.json\n```\n\n### 2.2 Add the shadcn configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"src/styles.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** With Tailwind CSS v4, the `config` field is optional.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Configure TypeScript Path Aliases\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Create the Utility Function\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Install Required Dependencies\n\nIn the `packages/ui` directory:\n\n```bash\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Set Up TSUP for Building\n\nThe key insight is that using `tsc` alone won't resolve the `@/` path aliases correctly when consuming the UI package from apps. **Use tsup instead.**\n\n### 6.1 Install tsup:\n\n```bash\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n### 6.2 Create `packages/ui/tsup.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n> **Important:** Setting `outDir: \"dist/tsup\"` prevents the CSS file from being deleted during parallel builds.\n\n### 6.3 Update `packages/ui/package.json` scripts:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:components\": \"tsup\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\",\n    \"dev:components\": \"tsup --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Configure Package Exports\n\nIn `packages/ui/package.json`, add the exports field:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./styles.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./shadcn/ui/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/ui/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/tsup/lib/*.mjs\",\n    \"./components/*\": {\n      \"import\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n      \"types\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\"\n    },\n    \"./hooks/*\": {\n      \"import\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n      \"types\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 8: Add shadcn Components\n\nFrom the `packages/ui` directory:\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card\n# Add more components as needed\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 9: Configure Your App to Use the UI Package\n\n### 9.1 Create `apps/web/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"app/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9.2 Import styles in your app's CSS:\n\nIn `apps/web/app/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n\n/* Or import shared styles */\n@import \"@repo/tailwind-config\";\n```\n\n### 9.3 Use Tailwind v4's `@source` directive:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@source \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n```\n\nThis tells Tailwind to scan the UI package for class names.\n\n---\n\n## Step 10: Using Components in Your App\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button\";\n// OR with workspace alias\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click Me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Project Structure\n\n```\nmonorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/\n│       ├── app/\n│       │   └── globals.css\n│       ├── components.json\n│       ├── package.json\n│       └── tsconfig.json\n├── packages/\n│

|\n|-------|-------|----------|\n| `Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'` | Path alias not configured | Check `tsconfig.json` paths and ensure tsup is properly configured |\n| `Module not found '@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button'` | Exports incorrect or not built | Run `pnpm run build:components` and verify exports in `package.json` |\n| Components have improper styling | CSS not imported | Ensure `@import(\"@repo/tailwind-config\")` or styles.css is imported |\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Use pnpm workspaces** with Turborepo for efficient monorepo management\n2. **Use tsup instead of tsc** to properly resolve path aliases in built output\n3. **Create separate `components.json` files** for the UI package and each app\n4. **Use Tailwind v4's `@source` directive** to scan UI package classes\n5. **Export components via package.json exports field** for clean imports\n\nThis setup provides a scalable architecture where shadcn/ui components live in a shared package and can be consumed across multiple applications in your monorepo.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026

\"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"app/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9.2 Import styles in your app's CSS:\n\nIn `apps/web/app/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n\n/* Or import shared styles */\n@import \"@repo/tailwind-config\";\n```\n\n### 9.3 Use Tailwind v4's `@source` directive:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@source \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n```\n\nThis tells Tailwind to scan the UI package for class names.\n\n---\n\n## Step 10: Using Components in Your App\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button\";\n// OR with workspace alias\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click Me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Project Structure\n\n```\nmonorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/\n│       ├── app/\n│       │   └── globals.css\n│       ├── components.json\n│       ├──

paths and ensure tsup is properly configured |\n| `Module not found '@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button'` | Exports incorrect or not built | Run `pnpm run build:components` and verify exports in `package.json` |\n| Components have improper styling | CSS not imported | Ensure `@import(\"@repo/tailwind-config\")` or styles.css is imported |\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Use pnpm workspaces** with Turborepo for efficient monorepo management\n2. **Use tsup instead of tsc** to properly resolve path aliases in built output\n3. **Create separate `components.json` files** for the UI package and each app\n4. **Use Tailwind v4's `@source` directive** to scan UI package classes\n5. **Export components via package.json exports field** for clean imports\n\nThis setup provides a scalable architecture where shadcn/ui components live in a shared package and can be consumed across multiple applications in your monorepo.","timestamp":47632}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Shadcn_Turborepo","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769684732822,"end":1769684780454,"firstResponse":47632,"sessionCreation":0,"total":47632},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.95,"reasoning":"Deterministic:

Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n```\n\n### 2. Create the Slider Component\n\nCreate a client component (since Swiper requires client-side JavaScript):\n\n```tsx\n// components/ImageSlider.tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\n\ninterface SlideData {\n  id: number;\n  src: string;\n  alt: string;\n  title?: string;\n}\n\ninterface ImageSliderProps {\n  slides: SlideData[];\n}\n\nexport default function ImageSlider({ slides }: ImageSliderProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-full\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{\n          delay: 5000,\n          disableOnInteraction: false,\n        }}\n        loop={true}\n        className=\"w-full\"\n      >\n        {slides.map((slide) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={slide.id}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-[50vh] md:h-[70vh] lg:h-[80vh]\">\n              <Image\n                src={slide.src}\n                alt={slide.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                priority\n              />\n              {slide.title && (\n                <div className=\"absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/30\">\n                  <h2 className=\"text-white text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold\">\n                    {slide.title}\n                  </h2>\n                </div>\n              )}\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Key Configuration Points\n\n**For Full-Width Responsive Images:**\n\n- Use `fill` prop on `next/image` to make the image fill its container\n- Set `sizes=\"100vw\"` to generate a full srcset optimized for responsive layouts\n- Use `style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}` to maintain aspect ratio while covering the container\n- The parent container needs `position: relative` and defined dimensions\n\n**Swiper Settings:**\n\n- `slidesPerView={1}` - shows one slide at a time for full-width effect\n- `spaceBetween={0}` - no gap between slides\n- `loop={true}` - enables infinite looping\n- Import only the modules you need (Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay)\n\n### 4. Usage in a Page\n\n```tsx\n// app/page.tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider';\n\nconst slides = [\n  { id: 1, src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1', title: 'Welcome' },\n  { id: 2, src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2', title: 'Discover' },\n  { id: 3, src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3', title: 'Explore' },\n];\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <ImageSlider slides={slides} />\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Optional: Custom Styling\n\n```css\n/* globals.css */\n.swiper-button-next,\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: white !important;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  background: white !important;\n}\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n1. **'use client' directive** is required because Swiper uses browser APIs\n2. **priority** prop on images loads them eagerly (good for above-the-fold sliders)\n3. For external images, configure `next.config.js` with allowed domains\n4. Use responsive height classes (`h-[50vh] md:h-[70vh]`) for different screen sizes","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":21955},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":21955},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VoSfagZACwt2N4RmES6Q3X","status":"completed","timestamp":21955},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search results, I can now provide you with a comprehensive guide on building a full-width responsive image slider using Next.js Image component and Swiper.\n\n## How to Build a Full-Width Responsive Image Slider with Next.js Image and Swiper\n\n### 1.

`onChange` is the preferred approach because it handles all interaction methods: mouse clicks, keyboard navigation, and screen readers\n   - `onClick` misses some accessibility use cases\n\n2. **Proper Label Association (Critical for Accessibility)**\n   ```jsx\n   // Best practice: wrap input in label\n   <label>\n     <input\n       type=\"checkbox\"\n       checked={checked}\n       onChange={() => onChange(!checked)}\n     />\n     {label}\n   </label>\n   \n   // Alternative: use htmlFor/id association\n   <label htmlFor=\"my-checkbox\">Accept Terms</label>\n   <input\n     type=\"checkbox\"\n     id=\"my-checkbox\"\n     checked={checked}\n     onChange={handleChange}\n   />\n   ```\n\n3. **Controlled Component Pattern (Recommended)**\n   ```jsx\n   import { useState } from 'react';\n   \n   const Checkbox = ({ label }) => {\n     const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);\n     \n     const handleChange = () => {\n       setChecked(!checked);\n     };\n     \n     return (\n       <label>\n         <input\n           type=\"checkbox\"\n           checked={checked}\n           onChange={handleChange}\n         />\n         {label}\n       </label>\n     );\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Reusable Checkbox Component**\n   ```jsx\n   const Checkbox = ({ checked, onChange, label, name }) => {\n     return (\n       <label className=\"checkbox\">\n         <input\n           type=\"checkbox\"\n           name={name}\n           checked={checked}\n           onChange={() => onChange(!checked)}\n         />\n         {label}\n       </label>\n     );\n   };\n   ```\n\n### When You Must Use onClick (Custom Checkboxes)\n\nIf building a fully custom checkbox using divs, include keyboard support:\n\n```jsx\nconst CustomCheckbox = ({ checked, onChange, label }) => {\n  const handleKeyDown = (event) => {\n    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {\n      event.preventDefault();\n      onChange(!checked);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      role=\"checkbox\"\n      aria-checked={checked}\n      tabIndex={0}\n      onClick={() => onChange(!checked)}\n      onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}\n    >\n      <span className=\"checkbox-visual\" />\n      <span className=\"checkbox-label\">{label}</span>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Summary\n- **Always use `onChange`** for native checkbox inputs\n- **Associate labels** using either wrapping or `htmlFor`/`id`\n- **Use controlled components** with `checked` + `onChange` for predictable state\n- Only use `onClick` for fully custom (non-native) checkbox implementations, and always pair with `onKeyDown` for accessibility","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","timestamp":18857},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":18857},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016Ex6jgNYgQYdHDupES8RZC","status":"completed","timestamp":18857},{"type":"message","content":"## React onClick Interaction for Checkbox Labels and Inputs in 2026\n\nBased on the latest best practices, here's how to handle React checkbox interactions properly:\n\n### Key Recommendations\n\n1. **Use `onChange` instead of `onClick` for checkboxes**\n   -

E.g., `BTC-USD` for coin-margined or `BTC-USDT` for USDT-margined |\n| `page_index` | No | int | Page number (default: 1) |\n| `page_size` | No | int | Records per page (default: 20, max: 50) |\n\n---\n\n### Response Example\n\n```json\n{\n    \"status\": \"ok\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"total_page\": 326,\n        \"current_page\": 1,\n        \"total_size\": 651,\n        \"data\": [\n            {\n                \"avg_premium_index\": \"-0.000862360011416593\",\n                \"funding_rate\": \"0.000100000000000000\",\n                \"realized_rate\": \"0.000099999999999999\",\n                \"funding_time\": \"1603843200000\",\n                \"contract_code\": \"BTC-USD\",\n                \"symbol\": \"BTC\",\n                \"fee_asset\": \"BTC\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"ts\": 1604312615051\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Response Fields\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `funding_rate` | string | The funding rate applied |\n| `realized_rate` | string | The actual realized funding rate |\n| `avg_premium_index` | string | Average premium index |\n| `funding_time` | string | Funding timestamp (milliseconds) |\n| `contract_code` | string | Contract code |\n| `symbol` | string | Trading symbol |\n| `fee_asset` | string | Fee asset (BTC/ETH/USDT) |\n\n---\n\n### Fetching 2026 Data\n\nTo get historical funding rates for 2026, you need to **paginate through all results** since the API returns data in chronological order (most recent first). The data includes all historical records.\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\nimport requests\nimport time\n\ndef get_historical_funding_rates(contract_code, contract_type=\"usdt\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetch all historical funding rates.\n    contract_type: \"usdt\" for USDT-margined, \"coin\" for coin-margined\n    \"\"\"\n    if contract_type == \"usdt\":\n        base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    else:\n        base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    \n    all_data = []\n    page_index = 1\n    page_size = 50\n    \n    while True:\n        params = {\n            \"contract_code\": contract_code,\n            \"page_index\": page_index,\n            \"page_size\": page_size\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        result = response.json()\n        \n        if result[\"status\"] != \"ok\":\n            break\n            \n        data = result[\"data\"][\"data\"]\n        all_data.extend(data)\n        \n        # Check if we've retrieved all pages\n        if page_index >= result[\"data\"][\"total_page\"]:\n            break\n            \n        page_index += 1\n        time.sleep(0.1)  # Rate limiting\n    \n    # Filter for 2026 data (timestamp range: Jan 1, 2026 to Dec 31, 2026)\n    # 2026-01-01 00:00:00 UTC = 1767225600000 ms\n    # 2026-12-31 23:59:59 UTC = 1798761599000 ms\n    start_2026 = 1767225600000\n    end_2026 = 1798761599000\n    \n    funding_2026 = [\n        record for record in all_data \n        if start_2026 <= int(record[\"funding_time\"]) <= end_2026\n    ]\n    \n    return funding_2026\n\n# Example usage\nrates = get_historical_funding_rates(\"BTC-USDT\", \"usdt\")\nfor rate in rates[:5]:\n    print(f\"Time: {rate['funding_time']}, Rate: {rate['funding_rate']}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Rate Limits:** HTX enforces API rate limits. For public interfaces, typically 72 requests per 3 seconds per UID.\n\n2. **No Authentication Required:** These are public endpoints - no API key needed.\n\n3. **Pagination Required:** To get all 2026 data, iterate through all pages using `page_index`.\n\n4. **Funding Interval:** HTX funding rates are typically calculated every 8 hours.\n\n5. **January 2024 Update:** As per HTX's announcement, parameters `estimated_rate`, `next_funding_time`, and `realized_rate` may return `null` for newer data due to funding rate calculation method changes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use the Huobi HTX /swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate or /linear-swap-api endpoint to get historical funding rates for 2026?","timestamp":45189},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":45189},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KPB1Z3jEp6dZQ2wfCc3LRk","status":"completed","timestamp":45189},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Gux9KyX4aipPhQ1sfgvgRQ","status":"completed","timestamp":45189},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed documentation on these specific endpoints:","timestamp":45189},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":45189},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01UbaARQ675qNaMPTY1QVkEd","status":"completed","timestamp":45189},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for the specific funding rate endpoints in the documentation:","timestamp":45189},{"type":"tool_call","name":"Grep","status":"pending","timestamp":45189},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NNRKxwdgsyyYvgNf5eB85R","status":"completed","timestamp":45189},{"type":"message","content":"I found the relevant documentation.

The data includes all historical records.\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\nimport requests\nimport time\n\ndef get_historical_funding_rates(contract_code, contract_type=\"usdt\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetch all historical funding rates.\n    contract_type: \"usdt\" for USDT-margined, \"coin\" for coin-margined\n    \"\"\"\n    if contract_type == \"usdt\":\n        base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    else:\n        base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    \n    all_data = []\n    page_index = 1\n    page_size = 50\n    \n    while True:\n        params = {\n            \"contract_code\": contract_code,\n            \"page_index\": page_index,\n            \"page_size\": page_size\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        result = response.json()\n        \n        if result[\"status\"] != \"ok\":\n            break\n            \n        data = result[\"data\"][\"data\"]\n        all_data.extend(data)\n        \n        # Check if we've retrieved all pages\n        if page_index >= result[\"data\"][\"total_page\"]:\n            break\n            \n        page_index += 1\n        time.sleep(0.1)  # Rate limiting\n    \n    # Filter for 2026 data (timestamp range: Jan 1, 2026 to Dec 31, 2026)\n    # 2026-01-01 00:00:00 UTC = 1767225600000 ms\n    # 2026-12-31 23:59:59 UTC = 1798761599000 ms\n    start_2026 = 1767225600000\n    end_2026 = 1798761599000\n    \n    funding_2026 = [\n        record for record in all_data \n        if start_2026 <= int(record[\"funding_time\"]) <= end_2026\n    ]\n    \n    return funding_2026\n\n# Example usage\nrates = get_historical_funding_rates(\"BTC-USDT\", \"usdt\")\nfor rate in rates[:5]:\n    print(f\"Time: {rate['funding_time']}, Rate: {rate['funding_rate']}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Rate Limits:** HTX enforces API rate limits. For public interfaces, typically 72 requests per 3 seconds per UID.\n\n2. **No Authentication Required:** These are public endpoints - no API key needed.\n\n3. **Pagination Required:** To get all 2026 data, iterate through all pages using `page_index`.\n\n4. **Funding Interval:** HTX funding rates are typically calculated every 8 hours.\n\n5. **January 2024 Update:** As per HTX's announcement, parameters `estimated_rate`, `next_funding_time`, and `realized_rate` may return `null` for newer data due to funding rate calculation method changes.","timestamp":45189}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Cryptocurrency Exchange","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769685431845,"end":1769685477034,"firstResponse":45189,"sessionCreation":0,"total":45189},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.99,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1641","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?\nBased on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer on how to use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026.\n\n## Creating Nodes from JSON in Figma Plugins (2026)\n\n### Key Methods in the Figma Plugin API\n\nThe Figma Plugin API provides several methods to programmatically create nodes from data:\n\n#### 1. **Direct Node Creation Methods**\nUse the `figma` global object to create individual nodes:\n\n```javascript\n// Create basic shapes\nconst rect = figma.createRectangle();\nconst ellipse = figma.createEllipse();\nconst frame = figma.createFrame();\nconst text = figma.createText();\nconst vector = figma.createVector();\nconst component = figma.createComponent();\n\n// Set properties after creation\nrect.x = 100;\nrect.y = 200;\nrect.resize(300, 150);\nrect.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0 } }];\n```\n\n#### 2. **Create Nodes from SVG**\n```javascript\nconst svgNode = figma.createNodeFromSvg('<svg>...</svg>');\n```\n\n#### 3. **Create Nodes from JSX (Widget API)**\n```javascript\nconst node = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(\n  <Frame width={200} height={100}>\n    <Text>Hello World</Text>\n  </Frame>\n);\n```\n\n### Building a JSON-to-Figma Import Plugin\n\nHere's a practical approach to parse JSON and create Figma nodes:\n\n```javascript\n// Example JSON structure for a design\nconst designJSON = {\n  type: \"FRAME\",\n  name: \"Card\",\n  width: 300,\n  height: 200,\n  fills: [{ type: \"SOLID\", color: { r: 1, g: 1, b: 1 } }],\n  children: [\n    {\n      type: \"TEXT\",\n      name: \"Title\",\n      x: 16,\n      y: 16,\n      characters: \"Hello World\",\n      fontSize: 24\n    },\n    {\n      type: \"RECTANGLE\",\n      name: \"Background\",\n      x: 0,\n      y: 0,\n      width: 300,\n      height: 200,\n      fills: [{ type: \"SOLID\", color: { r: 0.9, g: 0.9, b: 0.9 } }]\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\n// Recursive function to create nodes from JSON\nasync function createNodeFromJSON(json, parent) {\n  let node;\n  \n  switch (json.type) {\n    case \"FRAME\":\n      node = figma.createFrame();\n      break;\n    case \"RECTANGLE\":\n      node = figma.createRectangle();\n      break;\n    case \"ELLIPSE\":\n      node = figma.createEllipse();\n      break;\n    case \"TEXT\":\n      node = figma.createText();\n      await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: \"Inter\", style: \"Regular\" });\n      node.characters = json.characters || \"\";\n      if (json.fontSize) node.fontSize = json.fontSize;\n      break;\n    case \"VECTOR\":\n      node = figma.createVector();\n      break;\n    case \"COMPONENT\":\n      node = figma.createComponent();\n      break;\n    default:\n      return null;\n  }\n  \n  // Apply common properties\n  if (json.name) node.name = json.name;\n  if (json.x !== undefined) node.x = json.x;\n  if (json.y !== undefined) node.y = json.y;\n  if (json.width && json.height) node.resize(json.width, json.height);\n  if (json.fills) node.fills = json.fills;\n  if (json.strokes) node.strokes = json.strokes;\n  \n  // Append to parent\n  if (parent) {\n    parent.appendChild(node);\n  } else {\n    figma.currentPage.appendChild(node);\n  }\n  \n  // Recursively create children\n  if (json.children && node.appendChild) {\n    for (const childJSON of json.children) {\n      await createNodeFromJSON(childJSON, node);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return node;\n}\n\n// Usage in plugin\ncreateNodeFromJSON(designJSON).then(node => {\n  figma.viewport.scrollAndZoomIntoView([node]);\n  figma.closePlugin(\"Design imported successfully!\");\n});\n```\n\n### Available Community Plugins (2026)\n\n1. **JSON to Figma** - Import JSON data to populate text layers\n2. **Figma to JSON Exporter** - Export designs to structured JSON\n3. **Figma Variables to JSON** - Export/import design tokens and variables\n4. **Design Tokens plugins** - Sync design system tokens via JSON\n\n### Key Node Types You Can Create\n\n| Node Type | API Method |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Frame | `figma.createFrame()` |\n| Rectangle | `figma.createRectangle()` |\n| Ellipse | `figma.createEllipse()` |\n| Text | `figma.createText()` |\n| Vector | `figma.createVector()` |\n| Component | `figma.createComponent()` |\n| Line | `figma.createLine()` |\n| Polygon | `figma.createPolygon()` |\n| Star | `figma.createStar()` |\n| Section | `figma.createSection()` |\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Load fonts before setting text**: Always use `figma.loadFontAsync()` before modifying text content\n2. **Use async/await**: Many operations are asynchronous in the Plugin API\n3. **Batch operations**: Create nodes efficiently by minimizing redraws\n4. **Validate JSON**: Check your JSON structure matches expected Figma node properties\n5. **Handle errors**: Wrap node creation in try-catch blocks\n\nThis approach allows you to programmatically import designs from any JSON-based data source into Figma using the Plugin API.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use

     type: \"TEXT\",\n      name: \"Title\",\n      x: 16,\n      y: 16,\n      characters: \"Hello World\",\n      fontSize: 24\n    },\n    {\n      type: \"RECTANGLE\",\n      name: \"Background\",\n      x: 0,\n      y: 0,\n      width: 300,\n      height: 200,\n      fills: [{ type: \"SOLID\", color: { r: 0.9, g: 0.9, b: 0.9 } }]\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\n// Recursive function to create nodes from JSON\nasync function createNodeFromJSON(json, parent) {\n  let node;\n  \n  switch (json.type) {\n    case \"FRAME\":\n      node = figma.createFrame();\n      break;\n    case \"RECTANGLE\":\n      node = figma.createRectangle();\n      break;\n    case \"ELLIPSE\":\n      node = figma.createEllipse();\n      break;\n    case \"TEXT\":\n      node = figma.createText();\n      await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: \"Inter\", style: \"Regular\" });\n      node.characters = json.characters || \"\";\n      if (json.fontSize) node.fontSize = json.fontSize;\n      break;\n    case \"VECTOR\":\n      node = figma.createVector();\n      break;\n    case \"COMPONENT\":\n      node = figma.createComponent();\n      break;\n    default:\n      return null;\n  }\n  \n  // Apply common properties\n  if (json.name) node.name = json.name;\n  if (json.x !== undefined) node.x = json.x;\n  if (json.y !== undefined) node.y = json.y;\n  if (json.width && json.height) node.resize(json.width, json.height);\n  if (json.fills) node.fills = json.fills;\n  if (json.strokes) node.strokes = json.strokes;\n  \n  // Append to parent\n  if (parent) {\n    parent.appendChild(node);\n  } else {\n    figma.currentPage.appendChild(node);\n  }\n  \n  // Recursively create children\n  if (json.children && node.appendChild) {\n    for (const childJSON of json.children) {\n      await createNodeFromJSON(childJSON, node);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return node;\n}\n\n// Usage in plugin\ncreateNodeFromJSON(designJSON).then(node => {\n  figma.viewport.scrollAndZoomIntoView([node]);\n  figma.closePlugin(\"Design imported successfully!\");\n});\n```\n\n### Available Community Plugins (2026)\n\n1. **JSON to Figma** - Import JSON data to populate text layers\n2. **Figma to JSON Exporter** - Export designs to structured JSON\n3. **Figma Variables to JSON** - Export/import design tokens and variables\n4. **Design Tokens plugins** - Sync design system tokens via JSON\n\n### Key Node Types You Can Create\n\n| Node Type | API Method |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Frame | `figma.createFrame()` |\n| Rectangle | `figma.createRectangle()` |\n| Ellipse | `figma.createEllipse()` |\n| Text | `figma.createText()` |\n| Vector | `figma.createVector()` |\n| Component | `figma.createComponent()` |\n| Line | `figma.createLine()` |\n| Polygon | `figma.createPolygon()` |\n| Star | `figma.createStar()` |\n| Section | `figma.createSection()` |\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Load fonts before setting text**: Always use `figma.loadFontAsync()` before modifying text content\n2. **Use async/await**: Many operations are asynchronous in the Plugin API\n3. **Batch operations**: Create nodes efficiently by minimizing redraws\n4. **Validate JSON**: Check your JSON structure matches expected Figma node properties\n5. **Handle errors**: Wrap node creation in try-catch blocks\n\nThis approach allows you to programmatically import designs from any JSON-based data source into Figma using the Plugin API.","timestamp":39499}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"Figma_Plugin","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769685855242,"end":1769685894741,"firstResponse":39499,"sessionCreation":0,"total":39499},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic:

It is defined in `graphiti_core/prompts/extract_nodes.py` and is used as a response model when the LLM client extracts entities from text.\n\n### Model Definition\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass ExtractedEntity(BaseModel):\n    name: str = Field(..., description='Name of the extracted entity')\n    entity_type_id: int = Field(\n        description='ID of the classified entity type. '\n        'Must be one of the provided entity_type_id integers.',\n    )\n\nclass ExtractedEntities(BaseModel):\n    extracted_entities: list[ExtractedEntity] = Field(..., description='List of extracted entities')\n```\n\n### Important Considerations for 2026\n\n**1. This is an Internal Model**\n`ExtractedEntities` is primarily an internal response model used by Graphiti's LLM client during the entity extraction pipeline. You typically don't interact with it directly - Graphiti handles this automatically when you call `add_episode()`.\n\n**2. Common Validation Errors & Solutions**\nThere are well-documented issues with `ExtractedEntities` validation errors, especially when using:\n- Local LLMs (Ollama with deepseek-r1, llama models)\n- Third-party OpenAI-compatible APIs (Kimi K2, etc.)\n\nThe errors occur when the LLM returns a JSON schema definition instead of actual data:\n```\nValidationError: 1 validation error for ExtractedEntities\nextracted_entities - Field required [type=missing...]\n```\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n- **Use `OpenAIClient` instead of `OpenAIGenericClient`** for OpenAI-compatible providers (as noted in issue #912):\n  ```python\n  from graphiti_core.llm_client import OpenAIClient, LLMConfig\n  \n  llm_client = OpenAIClient(config=LLMConfig(\n      api_key=\"your-api-key\",\n      model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n      small_model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\n      base_url=\"your-base-url\",\n      temperature=0.1,\n  ))\n  ```\n\n- **Use larger models** that properly support structured JSON output (Graphiti maintainers recommend models with reliable JSON output capabilities)\n\n- **Use the official Ollama client** if available (PR #901 added dedicated Ollama support)\n\n**3. Custom Entity Types (Recommended Approach)**\nInstead of working with `ExtractedEntities` directly, use **Custom Entity Types** - a cleaner API for domain-specific entity extraction:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import Optional\n\n# Define custom entity types\nclass Person(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"A person entity.\"\"\"\n    age: Optional[int] = Field(None, description=\"Age of the person\")\n    occupation: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"Current occupation\")\n\nclass Company(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"A business organization.\"\"\"\n    industry: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"Primary industry\")\n    founded_year: Optional[int] = Field(None, description=\"Year founded\")\n\n# Use them with add_episode\nentity_types = {\n    \"Person\": Person,\n    \"Company\": Company,\n}\n\nawait graphiti.add_episode(\n    name=\"Business Update\",\n    episode_body=\"Sarah joined TechCorp as CTO in January 2023.\",\n    source_description=\"Business news\",\n    reference_time=datetime.now(),\n    entity_types=entity_types,  # Pass custom types here\n)\n```\n\n**4. For Advanced Use Cases**\nIf you need to work with `ExtractedEntities` directly (e.g., building custom extraction pipelines), the model is available from:\n```python\nfrom graphiti_core.prompts.extract_nodes import ExtractedEntities, ExtractedEntity\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- `ExtractedEntities` is an internal Pydantic model for LLM response parsing\n- Most users should use **Custom Entity Types** via `entity_types` parameter in `add_episode()`\n- Validation errors typically stem from LLMs not properly outputting structured JSON - use recommended models or the correct client class\n- Use `OpenAIClient` (not `OpenAIGenericClient`) with OpenAI-compatible providers for better results","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LWoYkxNPbLSKyfPVBqnEGG","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016YaUKpZcf3SgGDEPyd8WSc","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VgzA62bxM6GzDz4BsUQKcr","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01R95g99xYprxkCdnPUFezqW","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YD76ZpDkFepea8sVseY3rT","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KVag21ydCK8Gvr4zL7tGrN","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KqamipnxJHewkJDYUbFkVQ","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01D49WT4VVw2Cxkq4bZ92npt","status":"completed","timestamp":65609},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about how to use the graphiti `ExtractedEntities` response_model in 2026.\n\n## How to Use the Graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026\n\n### Overview\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` is an internal Pydantic model used by Graphiti for entity extraction from episodes.

{"id":"websearch-1804","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024\nNow I have comprehensive information about setting up custom color palettes in Tailwind CSS. Let me provide you with a complete answer.\n\n---\n\n## How to Set Up a Custom Color Palette for Mobile-First Responsive Design in Tailwind CSS (2024/2025)\n\n### Overview\n\nTailwind CSS v4 introduced a **CSS-first approach** where colors are defined using `@theme` blocks with CSS custom properties, replacing the old `tailwind.config.js` method. Tailwind is **mobile-first by default** — meaning all base styles apply to mobile, and larger breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) override them.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Adding Custom Brand Colors (Keeping Defaults)\n\nIn your main CSS file (e.g., `app.css`), use the `@theme` block:\n\n```css\n/* app.css */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Custom brand primary palette */\n  --color-primary-50: oklch(98.3% 0.02 250);\n  --color-primary-100: oklch(95.1% 0.03 250);\n  --color-primary-500: oklch(68% 0.1 250);\n  --color-primary-900: oklch(30% 0.12 250);\n  \n  /* Single accent color (no scale needed) */\n  --color-accent: #FF5A1F;\n}\n```\n\nThis automatically generates utilities like `bg-primary-500`, `text-primary-50`, `border-accent`, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Replacing the Entire Default Palette (Slim Builds)\n\nFor design systems where you want only your brand colors:\n\n```css\n@tailwind base;\n@theme {\n  --disable-default-colors: true;\n\n  /* Your brand-only palette */\n  --color-brand-50: #F5F5FA;\n  --color-brand-100: #EAEAFA;\n  --color-brand-500: #4F46E5;\n  --color-brand-900: #0D0D3B;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Mobile-First Responsive Color Usage\n\nTailwind is mobile-first by design. Apply colors for mobile, then override at larger breakpoints:\n\n```html\n<!-- Mobile: primary bg, Tablet+: accent bg -->\n<div class=\"bg-primary-500 md:bg-accent text-white p-4\">\n  Responsive color example\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: dark text, Desktop: light text -->\n<p class=\"text-primary-900 lg:text-primary-100\">\n  This text adapts to screen size\n</p>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dark Mode Theming with CSS Variables\n\n```css\n/* Light mode (default) */\n@theme {\n  --color-surface: #FFFFFF;\n  --color-content: #111827;\n}\n\n/* Dark mode */\nhtml.dark @theme {\n  --color-surface: #1F2937;\n  --color-content: #F9FAFB;\n}\n```\n\nUsage in HTML:\n```html\n<html class=\"dark\">\n  <body class=\"bg-surface text-content\">\n    ...\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. For Tailwind v3 (Legacy)\n\nIf still using v3, configure colors in `tailwind.config.js`:\n\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        primary: {\n          50: '#F5F5FA',\n          100: '#EAEAFA',\n          500: '#4F46E5',\n          900: '#0D0D3B',\n        },\n        accent: '#FF5A1F',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n| Aspect | Tailwind v4 | Tailwind v3 |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Config location | `@theme` block in CSS | `tailwind.config.js` |\n| Color format | OKLCH recommended | HEX/RGB |\n| Runtime theming | Built-in via CSS vars | Manual setup required |\n| Responsive | Mobile-first (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) | Same |\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Tools for Palette Generation\n- **oklch.com** — Convert HEX to OKLCH\n- **Tailwind Color Generator** at tailkits.com\n- **ColorWind.dev** — Generate palettes with mobile mockup previews","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","timestamp":29621},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":29621},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KLAZhqysRYTM8aQpiGG2cc","status":"completed","timestamp":29621},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":29621},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CdBT7EFVavC7MKWQvsc5hC","status":"completed","timestamp":29621},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have comprehensive information about setting up custom color palettes in Tailwind CSS.

Adding Custom Brand Colors (Keeping Defaults)\n\nIn your main CSS file (e.g., `app.css`), use the `@theme` block:\n\n```css\n/* app.css */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Custom brand primary palette */\n  --color-primary-50: oklch(98.3% 0.02 250);\n  --color-primary-100: oklch(95.1% 0.03 250);\n  --color-primary-500: oklch(68% 0.1 250);\n  --color-primary-900: oklch(30% 0.12 250);\n  \n  /* Single accent color (no scale needed) */\n  --color-accent: #FF5A1F;\n}\n```\n\nThis automatically generates utilities like `bg-primary-500`, `text-primary-50`, `border-accent`, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Replacing the Entire Default Palette (Slim Builds)\n\nFor design systems where you want only your brand colors:\n\n```css\n@tailwind base;\n@theme {\n  --disable-default-colors: true;\n\n  /* Your brand-only palette */\n  --color-brand-50: #F5F5FA;\n  --color-brand-100: #EAEAFA;\n  --color-brand-500: #4F46E5;\n  --color-brand-900: #0D0D3B;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Mobile-First Responsive Color Usage\n\nTailwind is mobile-first by design. Apply colors for mobile, then override at larger breakpoints:\n\n```html\n<!-- Mobile: primary bg, Tablet+: accent bg -->\n<div class=\"bg-primary-500 md:bg-accent text-white p-4\">\n  Responsive color example\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: dark text, Desktop: light text -->\n<p class=\"text-primary-900 lg:text-primary-100\">\n  This text adapts to screen size\n</p>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dark Mode Theming with CSS Variables\n\n```css\n/* Light mode (default) */\n@theme {\n  --color-surface: #FFFFFF;\n  --color-content: #111827;\n}\n\n/* Dark mode */\nhtml.dark @theme {\n  --color-surface: #1F2937;\n  --color-content: #F9FAFB;\n}\n```\n\nUsage in HTML:\n```html\n<html class=\"dark\">\n  <body class=\"bg-surface text-content\">\n    ...\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. For Tailwind v3 (Legacy)\n\nIf still using v3, configure colors in `tailwind.config.js`:\n\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        primary: {\n          50: '#F5F5FA',\n          100: '#EAEAFA',\n          500: '#4F46E5',\n          900: '#0D0D3B',\n        },\n        accent: '#FF5A1F',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points\n\n| Aspect | Tailwind v4 | Tailwind v3 |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Config location | `@theme` block in CSS | `tailwind.config.js` |\n| Color format | OKLCH recommended | HEX/RGB |\n| Runtime theming | Built-in via CSS vars | Manual setup required |\n| Responsive | Mobile-first (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) | Same |\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Tools for Palette Generation\n- **oklch.com** — Convert HEX to OKLCH\n- **Tailwind Color Generator** at tailkits.com\n- **ColorWind.dev** — Generate palettes with mobile mockup previews","timestamp":29621}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"CSS","lang":"CSS","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769686334752,"end":1769686364373,"firstResponse":29621,"sessionCreation":0,"total":29621},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Let me provide a comprehensive answer:\n\n## Using Rust libp2p Relay Client Behaviour to Dial Through a Relay\n\nBased on the current rust-libp2p documentation and examples (libp2p-relay v0.21.x), here's how to use the relay client behaviour to dial through a relay:\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **`relay::client::Behaviour`** - The client-side NetworkBehaviour for relay functionality\n2. **`relay::client::Transport`** - The transport layer for relayed connections\n3. **Circuit Relay v2 Protocol** - The underlying protocol specification\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Set up the Swarm with Relay Client\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    core::multiaddr::{Multiaddr, Protocol},\n    dcutr, identify, identity, noise, ping, relay,\n    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, SwarmEvent},\n    tcp, yamux, PeerId,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct Behaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    ping: ping::Behaviour,\n    identify: identify::Behaviour,\n    dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour,  // Optional: for hole punching\n}\n\nlet mut swarm = libp2p::SwarmBuilder::with_existing_identity(keypair)\n    .with_tokio()\n    .with_tcp(\n        tcp::Config::default().nodelay(true),\n        noise::Config::new,\n        yamux::Config::default,\n    )?\n    .with_quic()\n    .with_dns()?\n    .with_relay_client(noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)?  // Enable relay client\n    .with_behaviour(|keypair, relay_behaviour| Behaviour {\n        relay_client: relay_behaviour,\n        ping: ping::Behaviour::new(ping::Config::new()),\n        identify: identify::Behaviour::new(identify::Config::new(\n            \"/myapp/0.0.1\".to_string(),\n            keypair.public(),\n        )),\n        dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour::new(keypair.public().to_peer_id()),\n    })?\n    .build();\n```\n\n#### 2. Connect to the Relay Server First\n\nBefore dialing through the relay, connect to it directly:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_address: Multiaddr = \"/ip4/192.0.2.1/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...\".parse()?;\n\n// Dial the relay server directly\nswarm.dial(relay_address.clone())?;\n\n// Wait for connection and identify exchange\n// This allows you to learn your observed address\n```\n\n#### 3. Dial Through the Relay (Client Mode)\n\nTo dial a remote peer through the relay, construct a **circuit address** using `Protocol::P2pCircuit`:\n\n```rust\nlet remote_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse()?;\n\n// Build the relayed address:\n// /ip4/<relay-ip>/tcp/<relay-port>/p2p/<relay-peer-id>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<target-peer-id>\nlet relayed_addr = relay_address\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(remote_peer_id));\n\n// Dial through the relay\nswarm.dial(relayed_addr)?;\n```\n\n#### 4. Listen via a Relay (Server Mode)\n\nTo make your node reachable through a relay (when behind NAT):\n\n```rust\n// Listen on the relay for incoming relayed connections\nswarm.listen_on(relay_address.with(Protocol::P2pCircuit))?;\n\n// Handle reservation acceptance\nloop {\n    match swarm.next().await.unwrap() {\n        SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::RelayClient(\n            relay::client::Event::ReservationReqAccepted { .. },\n        )) => {\n            println!(\"Relay accepted our reservation!\");\n            break;\n        }\n        // Handle other events...\n        _ => {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Complete Multiaddr Format\n\n```\n/ip4/<relay-ip>/tcp/<relay-port>/p2p/<relay-peer-id>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<destination-peer-id>\n```\n\nExample:\n```\n/ip4/203.0.113.1/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWDpJ7As7BWAwRMfu1VU2WCqNjvq387JEYKDBj4kx6nXTN/p2p-circuit/p2p/12D3KooWPjceQr...\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **DCUtR (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay)**: Consider adding `dcutr::Behaviour` to attempt hole punching after establishing a relayed connection, as relay connections have bandwidth/time limits.\n- The relay server must support Circuit Relay v2 protocol (`/libp2p/circuit/relay/0.2.0/hop`)\n- Use `.with_relay_client()` in SwarmBuilder to properly configure the transport layer","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LNsuG4yEUnVLHWgnNjGt1d","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific documentation on the relay client behaviour:","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VuscMrykuhphQ4x9xXX46y","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017miFe7Sp3aFcjYgY3tF7At","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014WnB9dFbPqiv59W2W2AjQm","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me look at the GitHub repository for more detailed examples:","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WXcYptn353Ze8ntmdvntk5","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KUtyKMhBpf6vYQEteMjH5D","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KSCWAStHKRpLRBzPokhq26","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011WpucWgqpdS68W7D68E7BP","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me also get the relay-server example to provide a complete picture:","timestamp":66165},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LswPw3YpbgyHNvgPLfSeK8","status":"completed","timestamp":66165},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have all the information needed.

Let me fetch the detailed documentation from New API about payment settings.\nNow I have comprehensive information. Let me provide a detailed answer about integrating YiPay (易支付/EPay) with one-api and new-api.\n\n---\n\n## How to Integrate YiPay (易支付/EPay) with One-API and New-API in 2026\n\n### Overview\n\n**YiPay (易支付/EPay)** is a third-party aggregated payment gateway that supports WeChat Pay, Alipay, QQ Wallet, and other payment methods. Both **One-API** and **New-API** (a fork of One-API) natively support EPay integration for online recharge functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Integration with New-API\n\nNew-API has built-in support for EPay (易支付). Here's how to configure it:\n\n#### Step 1: Access Payment Settings\nGo to **System Settings → Payment Settings** in the New-API admin panel.\n\n#### Step 2: Configure EPay Gateway\nYou need to provide three key fields:\n- **API Base URL**: The EPay gateway endpoint (e.g., `https://your-epay-provider.com/`)\n- **Merchant ID (PID)**: Your merchant ID provided by the EPay service\n- **Merchant Key (KEY)**: Your secret key for signature verification\n\n#### Step 3: Configure Recharge Methods\nSet up the payment methods in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"自定义支付\",\n    \"color\": \"black\",\n    \"type\": \"custom1\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"50\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Field Reference:**\n- `name`: Display label on the payment button\n- `color`: Button theme color (CSS color value)\n- `type`: Channel identifier (`stripe` goes to Stripe; others like `alipay`, `wxpay`, `custom1` go to EPay gateway)\n- `min_topup`: Minimum allowed amount for this method\n\n#### Step 4: Configure Recharge Amounts (Optional)\nSet selectable amounts:\n```json\n[10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500]\n```\n\nConfigure discounts:\n```json\n{\n  \"100\": 0.95,\n  \"200\": 0.9,\n  \"500\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Integration with Original One-API\n\nThe original [One-API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api) by songquanpeng **does not include built-in EPay support**.

Let me provide a detailed answer about integrating YiPay (易支付/EPay) with one-api and new-api.\n\n---\n\n## How to Integrate YiPay (易支付/EPay) with One-API and New-API in 2026\n\n### Overview\n\n**YiPay (易支付/EPay)** is a third-party aggregated payment gateway that supports WeChat Pay, Alipay, QQ Wallet, and other payment methods. Both **One-API** and **New-API** (a fork of One-API) natively support EPay integration for online recharge functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Integration with New-API\n\nNew-API has built-in support for EPay (易支付). Here's how to configure it:\n\n#### Step 1: Access Payment Settings\nGo to **System Settings → Payment Settings** in the New-API admin panel.\n\n#### Step 2: Configure EPay Gateway\nYou need to provide three key fields:\n- **API Base URL**: The EPay gateway endpoint (e.g., `https://your-epay-provider.com/`)\n- **Merchant ID (PID)**: Your merchant ID provided by the EPay service\n- **Merchant Key (KEY)**: Your secret key for signature verification\n\n#### Step 3: Configure Recharge Methods\nSet up the payment methods in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"自定义支付\",\n    \"color\": \"black\",\n    \"type\": \"custom1\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"50\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Field Reference:**\n- `name`: Display label on the payment button\n- `color`: Button theme color (CSS color value)\n- `type`: Channel identifier (`stripe` goes to Stripe; others like `alipay`, `wxpay`, `custom1` go to EPay gateway)\n- `min_topup`: Minimum allowed amount for this method\n\n#### Step 4: Configure Recharge Amounts (Optional)\nSet selectable amounts:\n```json\n[10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500]\n```\n\nConfigure discounts:\n```json\n{\n  \"100\": 0.95,\n  \"200\": 0.9,\n  \"500\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Integration with Original One-API\n\nThe original [One-API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api) by songquanpeng **does not include built-in EPay support**. To add EPay functionality to original One-API:\n\n1. **Use New-API instead**: New-API is a fork of One-API that adds EPay support and is database-compatible with the original One-API.\n2. **Migrate existing data**: New-API can use the original `one-api.db` database directly.\n\n---\n\n### EPay Protocol Flow\n\nThe EPay protocol works as follows:\n\n1. **Order Creation**: Your system sends a payment request with:\n   - `out_trade_no`: Your order number\n   - `amount`: Payment amount\n   - `subject`: Order description\n   - `notify_url`: Callback URL for payment notifications\n   - `return_url`: Redirect URL after payment\n\n2. **Signature**: Requests are signed with your `PID/KEY` (typically MD5 or HMAC)\n\n3. **Payment Processing**: User is redirected to the payment page\n\n4. **Callback**: EPay gateway sends a signed callback to your `notify_url`; the system verifies and credits the account automatically\n\n---\n\n### Example API Request (LINUX DO Credit EPay)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://credit.linux.do/epay/pay/submit.php \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n  -d \"pid=001\" \\\n  -d \"type=epay\" \\\n  -d \"out_trade_no=M20250101\" \\\n  -d \"name=Test\" \\\n  -d \"money=10\" \\\n  -d \"sign=${SIGN}\" \\\n  -d \"sign_type=MD5\"\n```\n\n**Sign Generation:**\n```bash\npayload=\"money=10&name=Test&out_trade_no=M20250101&pid=001&type=epay\"\nsign=$(echo -n \"${payload}${SECRET}\" | md5)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Deployment Options\n\n**Docker Deployment:**\n```bash\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \\\n  -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data \\\n  calciumion/new-api:latest\n```\n\nDefault credentials: `root` / `123456`\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Compliance**: EPay gateways themselves are not licensed payment institutions.

The **shetabit/visitor** package already supports Laravel 10, 11, and 12. Looking at the current `composer.json` on the master branch (updated March 2025), the package requires:\n\n```json\n\"illuminate/support\": \"9.*|10.*|11.*|12.*\"\n```\n\n### Solutions\n\n#### 1. **Update to the Latest Version** (Recommended)\n\nIf you're getting version constraint errors, simply update to the latest version:\n\n```bash\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor\n```\n\nOr require the latest version explicitly:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor:^4.0\n```\n\n#### 2. **If the Package Version on Packagist is Outdated**\n\nSometimes the latest changes haven't been tagged/released yet. You can install directly from the master branch:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"dev-master\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOr with stability flag:\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor:dev-master\n```\n\n#### 3. **Fork and Fix (If Still Having Issues)**\n\nIf you need to fix it yourself, update your forked `composer.json`:\n\n```json\n\"require\": {\n    \"php\": \">=8.0\",\n    \"illuminate/support\": \"^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\"\n}\n```\n\nThen use your fork in your project's `composer.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/visitor\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"dev-master\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Use Composer Inline Alias** (Quick Fix)\n\nIf you need a quick workaround without forking:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor:\"dev-master as 4.0.0\"\n```\n\n### Common Error Messages and Their Fixes\n\nIf you see errors like:\n```\nshetabit/visitor requires illuminate/support ^5.0|^6.0|^7.0|^8.0 -> satisfiable by illuminate/support[...]\n```\n\nThis means you have an **older version** of the package cached. Run:\n\n```bash\ncomposer clear-cache\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThe package maintainer (via PR #64 merged on March 5, 2025) has already added Laravel 12 support. Make sure you're running the latest version.

{"id":"websearch-1909","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026\nI found the specific HAPP documentation. Let me fetch more details from the HAPP website to provide a complete guide.\nNow let me search for how to configure this with antidetect browsers specifically.\nNow I have comprehensive information. Let me provide you with a complete guide on setting up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser.\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up HAPP Proxy with \"Allow Connections from LAN\" Using SOCKS5 in an Antidetect Browser (2026)\n\n## Overview\n\nHAPP (Proxy Utility) is a cross-platform application that allows you to share your VPN/proxy connection with other devices on your local network. By enabling the **\"Allow LAN Connections\"** feature, you can route traffic from antidetect browsers on other devices through HAPP's SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Enable LAN Connections in HAPP\n\n1. **Open the HAPP app** on your device (available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)\n\n2. Go to **Settings → Advanced Settings**\n\n3. **Activate \"Allow LAN Connections\"** (or \"Allow connections from LAN\")\n\n4. **Connect to a VPN server** in the HAPP app\n\n5. After activation, note these parameters that will appear:\n   - **Current IP** — your device's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)\n   - **SOCKS5 Port** — typically `10808`\n   - **HTTP Port** — typically `10809`\n\n> ⚠️ **Important**: Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network/subnet for this to work.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Configure SOCKS5 Proxy in Your Antidetect Browser\n\nAll major antidetect browsers support SOCKS5 proxy configuration. Here's how to set it up in the most popular ones:\n\n### **Multilogin**\n1. Create or edit a browser profile\n2. Go to **Proxy settings**\n3. Select proxy type: **SOCKS5**\n4. Enter:\n   - **Host**: Your HAPP device's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)\n   - **Port**: `10808`\n5. Leave username/password blank (not required for LAN)\n6.

By enabling the **\"Allow LAN Connections\"** feature, you can route traffic from antidetect browsers on other devices through HAPP's SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Enable LAN Connections in HAPP\n\n1. **Open the HAPP app** on your device (available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)\n\n2. Go to **Settings → Advanced Settings**\n\n3. **Activate \"Allow LAN Connections\"** (or \"Allow connections from LAN\")\n\n4. **Connect to a VPN server** in the HAPP app\n\n5. After activation, note these parameters that will appear:\n   - **Current IP** — your device's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)\n   - **SOCKS5 Port** — typically `10808`\n   - **HTTP Port** — typically `10809`\n\n> ⚠️ **Important**: Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network/subnet for this to work.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Configure SOCKS5 Proxy in Your Antidetect Browser\n\nAll major antidetect browsers support SOCKS5 proxy configuration. Here's how to set it up in the most popular ones:\n\n### **Multilogin**\n1. Create or edit a browser profile\n2. Go to **Proxy settings**\n3. Select proxy type: **SOCKS5**\n4. Enter:\n   - **Host**: Your HAPP device's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)\n   - **Port**: `10808`\n5. Leave username/password blank (not required for LAN)\n6. Save and launch the profile\n\n### **GoLogin**\n1. Open profile settings\n2. Navigate to **Proxy** tab\n3. Choose **SOCKS5** from the dropdown\n4. Configure:\n   - **IP/Host**: `192.168.1.100` (your HAPP device IP)\n   - **Port**: `10808`\n5. Click **Check Proxy** to verify connection\n6. Save profile\n\n### **Dolphin Anty**\n1.

While tfsec continues to work, engineering focus has shifted to Trivy. For new projects, consider using Trivy with its backward-compatible tfsec ignore syntax.\n\n---\n\n## tfsec Exception Management\n\n### 1. Inline Ignores (Per-Resource)\nAdd comments directly in your Terraform code:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"my-rule\" {\n  type        = \"ingress\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]  #tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr\n}\n```\n\n**Multiple rules on one line:**\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:AWS017 tfsec:ignore:AWS002\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"backend\" {\n  bucket = \"backend\"\n  acl    = \"private\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Expiration Dates (Time-Bounded Exceptions)\nSet exceptions to automatically expire:\n\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-bucket-encryption:exp:2026-06-01\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"temp_bucket\" {\n  # Exception valid until June 1, 2026\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Workspace-Specific Ignores\nFor development vs. production environments:\n\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr:ws:development\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"dev-rule\" {\n  # Only ignored when --workspace=development\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Global Exclusions (CLI/Config)\nExclude checks globally via command line:\n```bash\ntfsec . -e check1,check2,check3\n```\n\nOr use a `tfsec.yml` configuration file to modify severity or exclude rules project-wide.\n\n### 5. Custom Rules\nCreate custom checks in `.tfsec/` folder using `*_tfchecks.json` or `*_tfchecks.yaml` files, or load via `--custom-check-dir`.\n\n---\n\n## Checkov Exception Management\n\n### 1. Inline Skip Comments\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Access logging not required for this bucket\n  bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\n**Multiple skips:**\n```hcl\nmodule \"bucket\" {\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_GCP_62\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_GCP_63\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_GCP_78\n  source = \"terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Baseline Files (Recommended for Production)\nCreate a baseline of known/accepted issues:\n\n```bash\n# Generate baseline file\ncheckov -d . --create-baseline\n\n# Run scans against the baseline\ncheckov -d . --baseline BASELINE\n```\n\nThis captures the current state and only flags new issues—ideal for production environments with legacy code.\n\n### 3. CLI Skip Options\n```bash\n# Skip specific checks\ncheckov -d . --skip-check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_19\n\n# Skip by severity\ncheckov -d . --skip-check LOW,MEDIUM\n```\n\n### 4. Configuration File (`.checkov.yaml`)\nFor production, use a config file to manage exceptions centrally:\n\n```yaml\n# .checkov.yaml\nskip-check:\n  - CKV_AWS_18\n  - CKV_AWS_19\n  - CKV2_AWS_62\n\n# Or use soft-fail for specific checks\nsoft-fail-on:\n  - CKV_AWS_20\n```\n\n### 5.
