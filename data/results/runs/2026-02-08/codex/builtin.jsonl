Docker’s own docs explicitly call out this incompatibility and recommend using the `DOCKER-USER` chain for filtering. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/?utm_source=openai))\n\nBelow are two supported approaches. The first is the practical, recommended path; the second is “strict mode” and usually breaks Docker networking unless you rebuild all rules yourself.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended: filter in `DOCKER-USER` (works with Docker’s rules)\n\n**What this does**  \nThe `DOCKER-USER` chain is evaluated *before* Docker’s own forwarding rules, so you can block/allow traffic there and keep Docker networking functional. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-iptables/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Typical goal**  \n- Block *all* external access to containers by default  \n- Allow only specific published ports or source IPs  \n- Also control internal/bridge traffic (east‑west) with forward rules\n\n**Example (iptables backend)**  \nAdd these to `/etc/ufw/before.rules` (or equivalent UFW rules file) **before** the `COMMIT` line:\n\n```\n*filter\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j RETURN\n\n# Allow from trusted LAN to published containers (example 192.168.1.0/24)\n-A DOCKER-USER -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j RETURN\n\n# Allow specific published ports (example 80/443)\n-A DOCKER-USER -p tcp --dport 80 -j RETURN\n-A DOCKER-USER -p tcp --dport 443 -j RETURN\n\n# Default deny everything else to containers\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP\nCOMMIT\n```\n\nThen reload UFW.

([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-iptables/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Typical goal**  \n- Block *all* external access to containers by default  \n- Allow only specific published ports or source IPs  \n- Also control internal/bridge traffic (east‑west) with forward rules\n\n**Example (iptables backend)**  \nAdd these to `/etc/ufw/before.rules` (or equivalent UFW rules file) **before** the `COMMIT` line:\n\n```\n*filter\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j RETURN\n\n# Allow from trusted LAN to published containers (example 192.168.1.0/24)\n-A DOCKER-USER -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j RETURN\n\n# Allow specific published ports (example 80/443)\n-A DOCKER-USER -p tcp --dport 80 -j RETURN\n-A DOCKER-USER -p tcp --dport 443 -j RETURN\n\n# Default deny everything else to containers\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP\nCOMMIT\n```\n\nThen reload UFW. This keeps Docker’s NAT/bridge logic intact but applies your policy first. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-iptables/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**For internal (container‑to‑container) traffic**  \nDocker’s bridge traffic is forwarded; you can also block that in `DOCKER-USER` by denying traffic where both source and destination are in the Docker bridge subnet(s). This is still done in the same chain. Docker’s docs emphasize that `DOCKER-USER` is the supported hook for filtering. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-iptables/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Strict mode: disable Docker’s iptables rules (high‑maintenance)\n\nDocker allows disabling its iptables management, but **their docs warn this is not appropriate for most users** and can break networking, NAT, and port publishing. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/?utm_source=openai))\n\nYou’d set:\n\n```\n{\n  \"iptables\": false\n}\n```\n\nand then rebuild **all** required NAT, forwarding, and filtering rules yourself. Docker warns that this is “extremely involved.” ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Why UFW “bypass” happens\n\nDocker publishes ports using NAT rules in the `nat` table before UFW’s `INPUT/OUTPUT` chains, so traffic never hits your UFW rules. Docker’s documentation explicitly explains this behavior and calls Docker and UFW incompatible by default. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\nIf you want a concrete policy, tell me:\n\n- Distro + version (Ubuntu? Debian?)  \n- `iptables` vs `nftables` backend (`update-alternatives --config iptables`)  \n- Whether you want to block all container-to-container traffic or allow per-network  \n- Example published ports you want open  \n\nI can give you exact `ufw`/`iptables` rules for your setup.","timestamp":18642}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"Docker_Networking","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770544938864,"end":1770544957506,"firstResponse":18642,"sessionCreation":0,"total":18642},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.73,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

Apps targeting earlier 4.x generally run on later 4.x; the reverse is not recommended. ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies))\n\n**Platform and architecture**\n- 4.8.1 adds **native Arm64 support**, enabling true Arm64 execution instead of x64 emulation on Arm devices. ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/whats-new/))\n- 4.8.1 targets newer Windows versions (Windows 11 and Windows 10 20H2+), whereas 4.8 supports Windows 7 SP1/8.1/10 and corresponding server platforms. ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/whats-new/))\n- 4.5.2 supports older Windows versions (Windows 7/8/8.1 and older server editions). ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies))\n\n**UI accessibility (major 4.8/4.8.1 focus)**\n- 4.8.1 adds **WCAG 2.1–compliant tooltips** and **Windows Forms accessibility improvements** (including UIA Text Pattern support and contrast fixes). ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/whats-new/))\n- 4.8 continues the accessibility focus and adds updates in WPF and related areas. ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/whats-new/))\n\n**Runtime, base-class, and framework features**\n- 4.8 changes cryptography behavior in FIPS mode (managed crypto classes redirect to system crypto instead of throwing), updates native zlib, and adds WCF service health endpoints. ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/whats-new/))\n- 4.5.2 added ASP.NET pipeline APIs (`AddOnSendingHeaders`, `QueueBackgroundWorkItem`, `HeadersWritten`), expanded WinForms high‑DPI resizing, workflow transaction APIs, and ETW tracing improvements.

([postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-createfunction.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Encourage omitting optional params via named notation (or by only sending the key from Supabase/PostgREST).

([postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-array.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Don’t mark the function `STRICT` if you want to allow `NULL`/omitted optional arrays; `STRICT` causes the function to return NULL without executing when any argument is NULL.

I’ll anchor this to current docs as of **February 8, 2026** and call out where behavior depends on model/provider support.\n\n**1) Multimodal input with `streamText` (Core API)**\n- `streamText` accepts `messages`, and **user messages can include an array of content parts** (e.g., `{ type: 'text' }`, `{ type: 'image' }`). This is the core, provider‑agnostic way to send images alongside text. ([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text?utm_source=openai))\n- The `image` part can be an **http(s) URL or base64 (including data URLs)**, depending on provider/model capabilities.

This conversion **handles multimodal content** and makes the messages compatible with `streamText`. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/convert-to-model-messages?utm_source=openai))\n- Example (Route Handler):\n```ts\nimport { convertToModelMessages, streamText } from 'ai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: someVisionModel,\n    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/convert-to-model-messages?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3) Provider/model constraints (important in 2026)**\n- **Vercel v0 provider**: supports text + image input but documents **base64‑encoded images** for multimodal input. If you’re using `@ai-sdk/vercel`, ensure your images are base64 (or confirm URL support per model). ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/v0/api?utm_source=openai))\n- **AI Gateway / OpenResponses**: image inputs are sent as `image_url` objects (URL **or** base64 data URI). This is provider‑specific, but useful if you’re using Gateway directly. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis/openresponses/image-input?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4) Image *output* (generation) with `streamText`**\n- Some **multimodal LLMs can return images** in their responses when using `streamText`, but this is model‑dependent and must be enabled via the model’s required configuration. Example: Gemini 3 Pro Image returns images in content parts. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n- OpenAI models can generate images through a **provider‑defined tool**; images stream back as tool‑result events.

([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5) Practical checklist (2026)**\n- Pick a vision‑capable model (e.g., GPT‑4.1/4o class, Gemini vision, Claude vision, or Vercel v0 vision). ([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text?utm_source=openai))\n- Use `messages` with content parts for image + text.

If you’re using `@ai-sdk/vercel`, ensure your images are base64 (or confirm URL support per model). ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/v0/api?utm_source=openai))\n- **AI Gateway / OpenResponses**: image inputs are sent as `image_url` objects (URL **or** base64 data URI). This is provider‑specific, but useful if you’re using Gateway directly. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis/openresponses/image-input?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4) Image *output* (generation) with `streamText`**\n- Some **multimodal LLMs can return images** in their responses when using `streamText`, but this is model‑dependent and must be enabled via the model’s required configuration. Example: Gemini 3 Pro Image returns images in content parts. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n- OpenAI models can generate images through a **provider‑defined tool**; images stream back as tool‑result events. This requires setting up the tool in `streamText`. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5) Practical checklist (2026)**\n- Pick a vision‑capable model (e.g., GPT‑4.1/4o class, Gemini vision, Claude vision, or Vercel v0 vision). ([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text?utm_source=openai))\n- Use `messages` with content parts for image + text. ([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text?utm_source=openai))\n- If you use UI SDK, pass through `convertToModelMessages`. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/convert-to-model-messages?utm_source=openai))\n- If you need image generation, choose a model that explicitly supports image outputs with `streamText`. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you tell me which provider/model you’re using (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Vercel v0, AI Gateway), I can give you a drop‑in example tailored to it.","timestamp":32462}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Vercel AI SDK multimodal","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770546017718,"end":1770546050180,"firstResponse":32462,"sessionCreation":0,"total":32462},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-614","input":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","output":"Here’s the current, Google‑documented guidance for getting embedded YouTube videos indexed, plus the most common fixes for “No video indexed” in Search Console. I’ll keep it focused on what’s actually required and what changed in recent years.\n\n**What changed (and why your embeds stopped indexing)**\n- Google now only shows **pages where the video is the main content** in Video mode; if the video is secondary to the text, Search Console will often show “No video indexed” with the reason **“Video is not the main content of the page.”** ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/12/video-is-the-main-content?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Must‑meet requirements for video indexing**\n- The **watch page must be indexed** and performing well enough in Search; video indexing is not automatic just because the page is indexed. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n- The video must be **visible on the page** (not hidden behind other elements or blocked by overlays/paywalls unless you use paywall structured data). ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n- The video must have a **valid, accessible thumbnail** at a stable URL. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Fixes that most often resolve YouTube embed indexing**\n1) **Make the video the primary content**\n   - Put the embed **above the fold** and make it the clear focal point.  \n   - Ensure the video is **large and prominent**. Google’s guidance for prominence issues includes minimum size/viewport recommendations (e.g., video visible on load and not too small). ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/video-indexing-specific-issues?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Reduce competing elements (large hero images, ads, or multiple videos) so Google can identify a single “main” video. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/12/video-is-the-main-content?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2) **Ensure visibility and size**\n   - The video should be **inside the initial viewport**, not below collapsible sections or tabs. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/video-indexing-specific-issues?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Avoid CSS that hides, overlays, or delays the embed after initial load. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3) **Provide clean video metadata**\n   - Add **VideoObject structured data** with a **unique** `name`, `description`, and `thumbnailUrl` per page. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/video?utm_source=openai))  \n   - If you supply metadata from multiple sources (structured data + sitemap), **keep thumbnail URLs consistent**. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/video?utm_source=openai))  \n\n4) **Verify with Search Console tools**\n   - Use **URL Inspection** to see if Google detected a video and why it wasn’t indexed. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/07/video-indexing-report?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Use the **Video indexing report** to validate fixes after you adjust the page. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/07/video-indexing-report?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Important nuance for YouTube embeds**\n- You can still get YouTube embeds indexed, but only if the page clearly presents the video as the main content.

I’ll keep it focused on what’s actually required and what changed in recent years.\n\n**What changed (and why your embeds stopped indexing)**\n- Google now only shows **pages where the video is the main content** in Video mode; if the video is secondary to the text, Search Console will often show “No video indexed” with the reason **“Video is not the main content of the page.”** ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/12/video-is-the-main-content?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Must‑meet requirements for video indexing**\n- The **watch page must be indexed** and performing well enough in Search; video indexing is not automatic just because the page is indexed. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n- The video must be **visible on the page** (not hidden behind other elements or blocked by overlays/paywalls unless you use paywall structured data). ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n- The video must have a **valid, accessible thumbnail** at a stable URL. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Fixes that most often resolve YouTube embed indexing**\n1) **Make the video the primary content**\n   - Put the embed **above the fold** and make it the clear focal point.  \n   - Ensure the video is **large and prominent**. Google’s guidance for prominence issues includes minimum size/viewport recommendations (e.g., video visible on load and not too small). ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/video-indexing-specific-issues?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Reduce competing elements (large hero images, ads, or multiple videos) so Google can identify a single “main” video. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/12/video-is-the-main-content?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2) **Ensure visibility and size**\n   - The video should be **inside the initial viewport**, not below collapsible sections or tabs. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/video-indexing-specific-issues?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Avoid CSS that hides, overlays, or delays the embed after initial load. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3) **Provide clean video metadata**\n   - Add **VideoObject structured data** with a **unique** `name`, `description`, and `thumbnailUrl` per page. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/video?utm_source=openai))  \n   - If you supply metadata from multiple sources (structured data + sitemap), **keep thumbnail URLs consistent**. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/video?utm_source=openai))  \n\n4) **Verify with Search Console tools**\n   - Use **URL Inspection** to see if Google detected a video and why it wasn’t indexed. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/07/video-indexing-report?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Use the **Video indexing report** to validate fixes after you adjust the page. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/07/video-indexing-report?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Important nuance for YouTube embeds**\n- You can still get YouTube embeds indexed, but only if the page clearly presents the video as the main content. If the page is a text‑heavy blog post with a small embed, Google may refuse to treat it as a video page. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/12/video-is-the-main-content?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- The exact Search Console issue message for a sample URL\n- Whether the video is above the fold\n- The embed size and layout (desktop + mobile)\n- Whether you already added VideoObject structured data\n\nI can give you a targeted fix list based on your layout and the exact error.","timestamp":20134}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"SEO_Indexing","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770546199841,"end":1770546219974,"firstResponse":20134,"sessionCreation":0,"total":20133},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

([clerk.com](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/verify-webhook?utm_source=openai))  \n- Route on `evt.type` and update your database: insert on create, update on update, and delete/soft‑delete on delete. (Event types confirmed by Clerk docs/blog.) ([clerk.com](https://clerk.com/blog/webhooks-getting-started?utm_source=openai))  \n- Harden the endpoint: allow only Svix webhook IPs if possible, keep it public (no auth), and make the handler idempotent. ([clerk.com](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks/overview?utm_source=openai))  \n- Ensure you’re on a patched `@clerk/*` version for `verifyWebhook` (security fix was released; older versions were vulnerable). ([clerk.com](https://clerk.com/changelog/2025-07-09-cve-2025-53548?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Minimal handler pattern (TypeScript, serverless‑style)**  \n```ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from \"@clerk/backend/webhooks\";\n\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(request);\n\n    switch (evt.type) {\n      case \"organization.created\":\n        // insert org in your DB\n        break;\n      case \"organization.updated\":\n        // update org fields in your DB\n        break;\n      case \"organization.deleted\":\n        // delete or soft-delete in your DB\n        break;\n      default:\n        // ignore other events\n        break;\n    }\n\n    return new Response(\"OK\", { status: 200 });\n  } catch (err) {\n    return new Response(\"Webhook verification failed\", { status: 400 });\n  }\n}\n```\nThis matches Clerk’s official webhook verification flow and keeps the endpoint public + verified. ([clerk.com](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/verify-webhook?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Implementation notes that prevent production issues**  \n- **Idempotency:** Use the webhook `id` as a de‑duplication key before mutating your DB (webhooks can be retried).  \n- **Soft deletes:** Many apps keep `deleted_at` or `is_deleted` instead of hard‑delete, to preserve auditability.  \n- **Selective sync:** Only persist the org fields you actually need; updates can include more data than you care about.  \n- **Secret management:** Store the signing secret in your env (e.g., `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`) and never hardcode it. ([clerk.com](https://clerk.com/docs/webhooks/sync-data?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Library version:** If you use `verifyWebhook`, ensure your Clerk package is >= the patched versions released after the 2025 security fix.

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"how to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Here’s the current, reliable playbook to fix (or avoid) PyTorch model‑loading deadlocks with multiprocessing. This is based on PyTorch’s official multiprocessing best‑practice docs (updated in 2024) and still applies in 2026. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nMost common root cause\n- A “poison fork” happens when you `fork` after CUDA/threads/locks are initialized; the child inherits a corrupted runtime state and hangs. PyTorch explicitly warns about this, and recommends `spawn` or `forkserver`. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nFix checklist (do these in order)\n1) Force a safe start method  \nUse `spawn` (most compatible) or `forkserver`.  \n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n```\nPyTorch docs explicitly require this for CUDA and to avoid fork‑related deadlocks. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Move *all* CUDA/model initialization inside the worker  \nDon’t import or touch CUDA before spawning. Initialize inside each process.  \n```python\ndef worker(rank, ...):\n    import torch\n    # init CUDA AFTER process start\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    model = MyModel().cuda()\n```\nThis avoids poison‑fork and lock inheritance issues. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.8/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n3) Guard your entry point  \nAlways use `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` so Windows/macOS and `spawn` don’t re‑execute module code. (This is required by Python multiprocessing and PyTorch’s spawn behavior.) ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n4) Avoid thread‑heavy queues  \nPyTorch notes that `multiprocessing.Queue` spins background threads that can deadlock after fork. If you pass objects between processes, prefer `SimpleQueue`. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) For DataLoader deadlocks, test `num_workers=0` first  \nIf the hang goes away, the issue is in the worker processes. Then:\n- Use `spawn`/`forkserver`.  \n- Ensure `worker_init_fn` is picklable (no lambdas) with `spawn`. ([pytorch-pfn-extras.readthedocs.io](https://pytorch-pfn-extras.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.2/reference/generated/pytorch_pfn_extras.dataloaders.dataloader.DataLoader.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n6) Don’t share GPU tensors through queues  \nPyTorch’s IPC for tensors has lifetime rules; if the sender exits or dies, receivers can hang. Keep the parent alive or avoid queueing GPU tensors. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nMinimal “safe” pattern\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\ndef worker(rank):\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    model = MyModel().cuda()\n    # load checkpoint here, not in parent\n    # run work...\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    mp.spawn(worker, nprocs=torch.cuda.device_count())\n```\n`spawn` is the PyTorch‑recommended default for safety, and `mp.spawn()` itself now always uses `spawn` internally for compatibility.

This is based on PyTorch’s official multiprocessing best‑practice docs (updated in 2024) and still applies in 2026. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nMost common root cause\n- A “poison fork” happens when you `fork` after CUDA/threads/locks are initialized; the child inherits a corrupted runtime state and hangs. PyTorch explicitly warns about this, and recommends `spawn` or `forkserver`. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nFix checklist (do these in order)\n1) Force a safe start method  \nUse `spawn` (most compatible) or `forkserver`.  \n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n```\nPyTorch docs explicitly require this for CUDA and to avoid fork‑related deadlocks. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Move *all* CUDA/model initialization inside the worker  \nDon’t import or touch CUDA before spawning. Initialize inside each process.  \n```python\ndef worker(rank, ...):\n    import torch\n    # init CUDA AFTER process start\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    model = MyModel().cuda()\n```\nThis avoids poison‑fork and lock inheritance issues. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.8/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n3) Guard your entry point  \nAlways use `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` so Windows/macOS and `spawn` don’t re‑execute module code. (This is required by Python multiprocessing and PyTorch’s spawn behavior.) ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n4) Avoid thread‑heavy queues  \nPyTorch notes that `multiprocessing.Queue` spins background threads that can deadlock after fork. If you pass objects between processes, prefer `SimpleQueue`. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) For DataLoader deadlocks, test `num_workers=0` first  \nIf the hang goes away, the issue is in the worker processes. Then:\n- Use `spawn`/`forkserver`.  \n- Ensure `worker_init_fn` is picklable (no lambdas) with `spawn`. ([pytorch-pfn-extras.readthedocs.io](https://pytorch-pfn-extras.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.2/reference/generated/pytorch_pfn_extras.dataloaders.dataloader.DataLoader.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n6) Don’t share GPU tensors through queues  \nPyTorch’s IPC for tensors has lifetime rules; if the sender exits or dies, receivers can hang. Keep the parent alive or avoid queueing GPU tensors. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nMinimal “safe” pattern\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\ndef worker(rank):\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    model = MyModel().cuda()\n    # load checkpoint here, not in parent\n    # run work...\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    mp.spawn(worker, nprocs=torch.cuda.device_count())\n```\n`spawn` is the PyTorch‑recommended default for safety, and `mp.spawn()` itself now always uses `spawn` internally for compatibility. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you still hang after these fixes\n- Remove all queues/events to isolate; there are known deadlock patterns when mixing queues/events with `mp.spawn`. ([github.com](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32322?utm_source=openai))\n- Print/log from each worker immediately after start; if it never prints, your initialization is hanging (often CUDA init or file I/O).\n- Try `forkserver` if `spawn` is too slow or memory‑heavy (but still safe vs `fork`).

{"id":"websearch-1041","input":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","output":"As of February 8, 2026, the most common Go version‑compatibility errors around `govulncheck` fall into a few repeatable patterns. Here’s what usually causes them and the quickest fixes.\n\n**Common causes**\n- **Go toolchain older than your module/workspace `go` line**: If `go.mod`/`go.work` requires a newer Go version than the toolchain that actually runs, the `go` command will refuse to proceed (or switch toolchains only if auto‑switching is allowed). ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Dependency requires a newer Go version**: If any dependency’s `go` line is higher than your main module or workspace, the `go` command can be forced to upgrade or will fail when toolchain switching is restricted. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Toolchain auto‑switching disabled**: Setting `GOTOOLCHAIN` to a fixed or “local only” value prevents upgrades, causing version‑mismatch failures when a higher Go version is required. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **govulncheck runs with a different Go than you expect**: For source scanning, govulncheck uses the Go version found on `PATH`; if that’s older than your module’s required version, it will fail or give misleading results. ([pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck?utm_source=openai))\n- **Installing govulncheck with an older Go**: Occasionally the `x/vuln` code (govulncheck’s module) or its deps use standard‑library APIs introduced in newer Go releases, which makes older Go versions fail at install/build time (e.g., “package slices is not in GOROOT”). ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/68034?utm_source=openai))\n- **CI action sets a different Go version than your `go.mod`**: In GitHub Actions, conflicting inputs (like `go-version` vs `go-version-file`) can silently choose a different version than your module expects. ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/70036?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Resolutions that work reliably in 2026**\n- **Align toolchain to the module’s `go` line**  \n  - Upgrade Go so the installed toolchain is **≥** the `go` line in `go.mod`/`go.work`. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n  - Or update the module’s `go`/`toolchain` lines with `go get` to match the toolchain you intend to use. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Allow automatic toolchain upgrades**  \n  - Use `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` (or `version+auto`) so the `go` command can switch to a newer toolchain when required.

It must describe concrete fixes such as aligning PATH/CI Go versions with `go.mod`, updating to a supported Go/govulncheck release, correcting invalid `go` directives (e.g., avoiding patch versions like `1.22.1`), or switching the active Go toolchain to match the project’s declared version.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"As of February 8, 2026, the most common Go version‑compatibility errors around `govulncheck` fall into a few repeatable patterns. Here’s what usually causes them and the quickest fixes.\n\n**Common causes**\n- **Go toolchain older than your module/workspace `go` line**: If `go.mod`/`go.work` requires a newer Go version than the toolchain that actually runs, the `go` command will refuse to proceed (or switch toolchains only if auto‑switching is allowed). ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Dependency requires a newer Go version**: If any dependency’s `go` line is higher than your main module or workspace, the `go` command can be forced to upgrade or will fail when toolchain switching is restricted. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Toolchain auto‑switching disabled**: Setting `GOTOOLCHAIN` to a fixed or “local only” value prevents upgrades, causing version‑mismatch failures when a higher Go version is required. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **govulncheck runs with a different Go than you expect**: For source scanning, govulncheck uses the Go version found on `PATH`; if that’s older than your module’s required version, it will fail or give misleading results. ([pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck?utm_source=openai))\n- **Installing govulncheck with an older Go**: Occasionally the `x/vuln` code (govulncheck’s module) or its deps use standard‑library APIs introduced in newer Go releases, which makes older Go versions fail at install/build time (e.g., “package slices is not in GOROOT”). ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/68034?utm_source=openai))\n- **CI action sets a different Go version than your `go.mod`**: In GitHub Actions, conflicting inputs (like `go-version` vs `go-version-file`) can silently choose a different version than your module expects. ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/70036?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Resolutions that work reliably in 2026**\n- **Align toolchain to the module’s `go` line**  \n  - Upgrade Go so the installed toolchain is **≥** the `go` line in `go.mod`/`go.work`. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n  - Or update the module’s `go`/`toolchain` lines with `go get` to match the toolchain you intend to use. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Allow automatic toolchain upgrades**  \n  - Use `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` (or `version+auto`) so the `go` command can switch to a newer toolchain when required. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Make sure govulncheck and Go are in sync**  \n  - Check `govulncheck -version` and `go version` to ensure they reflect the same or compatible Go toolchain; govulncheck uses the Go version on `PATH` for source scans.

Let the Dockerfile’s `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` run. This is a common cause. ([station.railway.com](https://station.railway.com/questions/the-executable-cd-could-not-be-found-2c441b11?utm_source=openai))  \n  2) In the Dockerfile, use `WORKDIR` instead of `cd`, e.g.:\n     ```dockerfile\n     WORKDIR /app\n     CMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n     ```\n- **If you must change directories in a Railway Start/Build Command**:  \n  Wrap it in a shell explicitly:\n  ```bash\n  /bin/sh -lc \"cd /app && npm start\"\n  ```\n  (This forces a shell to interpret `cd`.)\n\n- **If you’re not using a Dockerfile (Nixpacks)**:  \n  Use a proper start command that doesn’t include `cd`, or set the working directory in configuration (if supported).

{"id":"websearch-1828","input":"How to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?","output":"Short answer: **New API supports EPay‑style gateways (易支付)**, so YiPay works if it is EPay‑compatible. The official **one‑api** repo doesn’t document any built‑in payment/top‑up gateway, so you either need a fork that adds EPay support or migrate to new‑api for online充值. ([newapi.ai](https://www.newapi.ai/zh/docs/guide/console/settings/payment-settings?utm_source=openai))\n\n**New API (recommended path)**\n- In the admin console, go to **Payment Settings** and choose **EPay**; you must provide **API Address**, **Merchant ID (PID)**, and **Merchant Key (KEY)**. The system expects a signed callback and will auto‑credit on verification. ([newapi.ai](https://www.newapi.ai/zh/docs/guide/console/settings/payment-settings?utm_source=openai))\n- Configure “Recharge methods” in New API: `type` values like `alipay`/`wxpay` are passed through to the EPay gateway; `stripe` routes to Stripe. ([newapi.ai](https://www.newapi.ai/zh/docs/guide/console/settings/payment-settings?utm_source=openai))\n- Use YiPay’s **EPay‑style API base URL** as the “API Address.” Typical EPay/YiPay gateways expose endpoints like `/submit.php` or `/pay/apisubmit` with parameters such as `pid`, `type`, `out_trade_no`, `notify_url`, `return_url`, `name`, `money`, `sign`, `sign_type`. Confirm the exact endpoint and signing method in your YiPay docs. ([ypay.yvdian.cn](https://ypay.yvdian.cn/doc/api?utm_source=openai))\n\n**One‑API**\n- The **official one‑api README** does not mention any “Payment Settings” or EPay/易支付 integration, so stock one‑api may not support online recharge out‑of‑the‑box. ([github.com](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api?utm_source=openai))\n- If your one‑api build **does** show “支付设置/充值” in the UI (some forks do), the configuration is typically identical to New API’s EPay fields: **API Address + PID + KEY**.\n\n**Common pitfalls**\n- **Signing algorithm mismatch:** Some YiPay/易支付 providers now use **RSA (v2)** instead of **MD5 (v1)**.

The official **one‑api** repo doesn’t document any built‑in payment/top‑up gateway, so you either need a fork that adds EPay support or migrate to new‑api for online充值. ([newapi.ai](https://www.newapi.ai/zh/docs/guide/console/settings/payment-settings?utm_source=openai))\n\n**New API (recommended path)**\n- In the admin console, go to **Payment Settings** and choose **EPay**; you must provide **API Address**, **Merchant ID (PID)**, and **Merchant Key (KEY)**. The system expects a signed callback and will auto‑credit on verification. ([newapi.ai](https://www.newapi.ai/zh/docs/guide/console/settings/payment-settings?utm_source=openai))\n- Configure “Recharge methods” in New API: `type` values like `alipay`/`wxpay` are passed through to the EPay gateway; `stripe` routes to Stripe. ([newapi.ai](https://www.newapi.ai/zh/docs/guide/console/settings/payment-settings?utm_source=openai))\n- Use YiPay’s **EPay‑style API base URL** as the “API Address.” Typical EPay/YiPay gateways expose endpoints like `/submit.php` or `/pay/apisubmit` with parameters such as `pid`, `type`, `out_trade_no`, `notify_url`, `return_url`, `name`, `money`, `sign`, `sign_type`. Confirm the exact endpoint and signing method in your YiPay docs. ([ypay.yvdian.cn](https://ypay.yvdian.cn/doc/api?utm_source=openai))\n\n**One‑API**\n- The **official one‑api README** does not mention any “Payment Settings” or EPay/易支付 integration, so stock one‑api may not support online recharge out‑of‑the‑box. ([github.com](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api?utm_source=openai))\n- If your one‑api build **does** show “支付设置/充值” in the UI (some forks do), the configuration is typically identical to New API’s EPay fields: **API Address + PID + KEY**.\n\n**Common pitfalls**\n- **Signing algorithm mismatch:** Some YiPay/易支付 providers now use **RSA (v2)** instead of **MD5 (v1)**.
