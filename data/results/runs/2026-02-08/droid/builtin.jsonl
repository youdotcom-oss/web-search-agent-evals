Eliminate navigation and distractions that pull users away from conversion\n2. **Visual-First Approach** - Users skim content and seek quick clarity. Lead with compelling visuals and benefit-driven headlines\n3. **Mobile-First Optimization** - Most conversions now happen on smartphones; prioritize fast load times and touch-friendly interactions\n4. **Conversion-Centric Minimalism** - Clean layouts with reduced navigation, strategic whitespace, and prominent CTAs above the fold\n\n### Advanced 2026 Tactics\n- **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** - Optimize for AI-generated search results and voice assistants\n- **Hyper-Personalization** - Tailor content, social proof, and CTAs based on visitor segment/funnel stage using AI\n- **Real-Time Personalization** - Machine learning adapts content dynamically based on user behavior\n- **Product-Led Storytelling** - Show real product interfaces and workflows instead of abstract visuals\n\n### Form & CTA Best Practices\n- Reduce form fields (4 vs 11 fields = 120% conversion increase)\n- Use action-oriented CTA text (\"Trial for free\" vs \"Sign up\" = 104% lift)\n- Single primary CTA above the fold to reduce decision paralysis\n\n---\n\n## 🖼️ Responsive Gallery Design Patterns\n\n### CSS Grid Masonry Layouts\nThe dominant pattern in 2026 uses **CSS Grid Level 3** with native masonry support (now available in Firefox, expanding to other browsers):\n\n```css\n.gallery {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));\n  grid-template-rows: masonry; /* Native masonry */\n  gap: 1rem;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Techniques\n1. **Multi-Column Masonry** - Pinterest-style layouts with `break-inside: avoid` for cards\n2. **Auto-fit/Auto-fill** - `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))` for fluid responsive columns\n3. **Span Control** - Allow featured items to span multiple columns/rows\n4. **ResizeObserver** - JavaScript fallback for browsers without native masonry (66 lines for cross-browser support)\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n- **Mobile**: Single column, full-width images\n- **Tablet**: 2-column grid\n- **Desktop**: 3-4 column masonry with dense packing\n\n### Modern Enhancements\n- **Anchor-positioning** for image swap effects without JavaScript\n- **Container queries** for component-based responsiveness\n- **Lazy loading** with `loading=\"lazy\"` and intersection observers\n- **Aspect-ratio** property to prevent layout shifts\n\n---\n\n## 💰 Responsive Pricing Table Patterns\n\n### Best Design Practices\n1. **3-4 Tier Maximum** - Avoid choice overload; 3 plans is ideal\n2. **Clear Visual Hierarchy** - Plan names, prices, and differences visible without scrolling\n3. **Highlight Recommended Plan** - Use visual emphasis (larger size, border, badge) on best-value option\n4. **Scannable Feature Lists** - Align features across columns with checkmarks/X marks\n5. **Single CTA per Plan** - Consistent buttons like \"Get Started\" or \"Choose Plan\"\n\n### Responsive Layout Patterns\n\n**Three-Column Comparison** (Most common for SaaS):\n```css\n.pricing-grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));\n  gap: 2rem;\n}\n```\n\n**Monthly/Annual Toggle**:\n- Alpine.js or vanilla JS for seamless billing period switching\n- Show discount percentage for annual plans\n- Single table that updates dynamically\n\n**Mobile Adaptations**:\n- Stack cards vertically on mobile\n- Collapsible feature comparison (accordion)\n- Sticky CTA buttons at bottom of viewport\n- Horizontal scroll for comparison tables (with visual indicators)\n\n### Advanced Features for 2026\n- **AI-Powered Personalization** - Dynamic pricing display based on user behavior\n- **Real-Time Updates** - Live pricing that responds to promotions\n- **WCAG Accessibility** - Proper table semantics for screen readers\n- **Transparent Pricing** - 89% of SaaS buyers prefer upfront pricing (no \"Contact Us\" for pricing)\n\n### CSS Techniques\n```css\n/* Highlight best value */\n.plan--featured {\n  transform: scale(1.05);\n  border: 2px solid var(--accent);\n  box-shadow: 0 10px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);\n}\n\n/* Responsive with Container Queries */\n@container (min-width: 600px) {\n  .pricing-table { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);

You create a Cognitive Services Account and then deploy the model.\n\n**TypeScript Example:**\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// 1. Create a Resource Group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg\", {\n    resourceGroupName: \"my-ai-rg\",\n    location: \"eastus\",\n});\n\n// 2. Create a Cognitive Services Account (Azure OpenAI)\nconst cognitiveAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    accountName: \"my-openai-account\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",  // Use \"OpenAI\" for GPT models\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\",\n    },\n    properties: {\n        customSubDomainName: \"my-openai-endpoint\",\n        publicNetworkAccess: \"Enabled\",\n    },\n});\n\n// 3. Deploy a GPT Model\nconst gptDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    accountName: cognitiveAccount.name,\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-4-deployment\",\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-4\",        // Model name: gpt-4, gpt-4o, gpt-35-turbo, etc.\n            version: \"turbo-2024-04-09\",  // Check available versions in your region\n        },\n        versionUpgradeOption: \"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    },\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10,  // Tokens per minute (in thousands)\n    },\n});\n\n// Export the endpoint\nexport const endpoint = cognitiveAccount.properties.apply(p => p?.endpoint);\n```\n\n**Python Example:**\n\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport pulumi_azure_native as azure_native\n\n# 1. Create a Resource Group\nresource_group = azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg\",\n    resource_group_name=\"my-ai-rg\",\n    location=\"eastus\")\n\n# 2.

You create a Cognitive Services Account and then deploy the model.\n\n**TypeScript Example:**\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// 1. Create a Resource Group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg\", {\n    resourceGroupName: \"my-ai-rg\",\n    location: \"eastus\",\n});\n\n// 2. Create a Cognitive Services Account (Azure OpenAI)\nconst cognitiveAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    accountName: \"my-openai-account\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",  // Use \"OpenAI\" for GPT models\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\",\n    },\n    properties: {\n        customSubDomainName: \"my-openai-endpoint\",\n        publicNetworkAccess: \"Enabled\",\n    },\n});\n\n// 3. Deploy a GPT Model\nconst gptDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    accountName: cognitiveAccount.name,\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-4-deployment\",\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-4\",        // Model name: gpt-4, gpt-4o, gpt-35-turbo, etc.\n            version: \"turbo-2024-04-09\",  // Check available versions in your region\n        },\n        versionUpgradeOption: \"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    },\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10,  // Tokens per minute (in thousands)\n    },\n});\n\n// Export the endpoint\nexport const endpoint = cognitiveAccount.properties.apply(p => p?.endpoint);\n```\n\n**Python Example:**\n\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport pulumi_azure_native as azure_native\n\n# 1.

This means traffic to Docker containers bypasses UFW entirely, potentially exposing services you thought were protected.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions (from simplest to most comprehensive)\n\n### **Solution 1: Bind Ports to localhost Only (Simplest)**\n\nThe easiest fix is to bind Docker ports to `127.0.0.1` instead of all interfaces:\n\n```yaml\n# docker-compose.yml\nservices:\n  my-service:\n    ports:\n      - \"127.0.0.1:8080:80\"  # Only accessible from localhost\n```\n\nOr with `docker run`:\n```bash\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 myimage\n```\n\nThen use a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) on the host to expose services as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Modify UFW after.rules (Recommended)**\n\nAdd rules to `/etc/ufw/after.rules` to make UFW filter Docker traffic:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/ufw/after.rules\n```\n\nAdd these rules **at the end of the file** (before any COMMIT if present):\n\n```bash\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [ACCEPT]\n:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [ACCEPT]\n:DOCKER-USER - [ACCEPT]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 169.254.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 169.254.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] \"\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\nThen reload:\n```bash\nsudo ufw reload\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Use ufw-docker Tool (Most Comprehensive)**\n\nInstall the `ufw-docker` utility:\n\n```bash\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\nsudo ufw-docker install\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\nThen manage access with:\n```bash\n# Allow external access to container port\nsudo ufw-docker allow container_name 80/tcp\n\n# Allow from specific IP only\nsudo ufw-docker allow container_name 80/tcp 192.168.1.100\n\n# Delete a rule\nsudo ufw-docker delete allow container_name 80/tcp\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 4: Disable Docker's iptables Management**\n\nEdit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"iptables\": false\n}\n```\n\nThen restart Docker:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: This breaks container networking.

This means traffic to Docker containers bypasses UFW entirely, potentially exposing services you thought were protected.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions (from simplest to most comprehensive)\n\n### **Solution 1: Bind Ports to localhost Only (Simplest)**\n\nThe easiest fix is to bind Docker ports to `127.0.0.1` instead of all interfaces:\n\n```yaml\n# docker-compose.yml\nservices:\n  my-service:\n    ports:\n      - \"127.0.0.1:8080:80\"  # Only accessible from localhost\n```\n\nOr with `docker run`:\n```bash\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 myimage\n```\n\nThen use a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) on the host to expose services as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Modify UFW after.rules (Recommended)**\n\nAdd rules to `/etc/ufw/after.rules` to make UFW filter Docker traffic:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/ufw/after.rules\n```\n\nAdd these rules **at the end of the file** (before any COMMIT if present):\n\n```bash\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [ACCEPT]\n:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [ACCEPT]\n:DOCKER-USER - [ACCEPT]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 169.254.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 169.254.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] \"\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\nThen reload:\n```bash\nsudo ufw reload\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Use ufw-docker Tool (Most Comprehensive)**\n\nInstall the `ufw-docker` utility:\n\n```bash\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\nsudo ufw-docker install\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\nThen manage access with:\n```bash\n# Allow external access to container port\nsudo ufw-docker allow container_name 80/tcp\n\n# Allow from specific IP only\nsudo ufw-docker allow container_name 80/tcp 192.168.1.100\n\n# Delete a rule\nsudo ufw-docker delete allow container_name 80/tcp\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 4: Disable Docker's iptables Management**\n\nEdit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"iptables\": false\n}\n```\n\nThen restart Docker:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: This breaks container networking. You'll need to manually configure all network rules and NAT/masquerading.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Comparison\n\n| Solution | Complexity | Recommendation |\n|----------|------------|----------------|\n| Bind to localhost | Low | Best for single-host setups with reverse proxy |\n| Modify after.rules | Medium | Good balance of security and flexibility |\n| ufw-docker tool | Medium | Best for managing multiple containers |\n| Disable iptables | High | Only for advanced users who need full control |\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nFor most use cases in 2024, **binding ports to `127.0.0.1`** combined with a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy/Traefik) is the cleanest solution.

PostgreSQL Function Definition\n\nUse `DEFAULT NULL` or `DEFAULT '{}'` (empty array) for optional array parameters:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing(\n    base_price numeric,\n    pricing_overrides jsonb[] DEFAULT NULL  -- or DEFAULT '{}'\n)\nRETURNS numeric\nLANGUAGE plpgsql\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n    -- Handle null/empty array case\n    IF pricing_overrides IS NULL OR array_length(pricing_overrides, 1) IS NULL THEN\n        RETURN base_price;\n    END IF;\n    \n    -- Process overrides\n    -- ... pricing logic\nEND;\n$$;\n```\n\n## 2. Choose Between `NULL` vs Empty Array Default\n\n| Default | When to Use |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `DEFAULT NULL` | When \"no overrides\" has distinct meaning from \"empty list\" |\n| `DEFAULT '{}'` | When you want to avoid null checks and treat missing = empty |\n\nFor pricing overrides, **`DEFAULT NULL`** is typically preferred because it clearly signals \"use standard pricing\" vs \"explicitly no overrides.\"\n\n## 3. Client-Side Call (Supabase JS)\n\n```typescript\n// With overrides\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing', {\n  base_price: 99.99,\n  pricing_overrides: [\n    { type: 'discount', value: 10 },\n    { type: 'tax', value: 8.5 }\n  ]\n});\n\n// Without overrides - simply omit the parameter\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing', {\n  base_price: 99.99\n  // pricing_overrides omitted, defaults to NULL\n});\n```\n\n## 4. Type Safety with TypeScript\n\nDefine explicit types for your override structure:\n\n```typescript\ntype PricingOverride = {\n  type: 'discount' | 'tax' | 'surcharge';\n  value: number;\n  reason?: string;\n};\n\n// Use with RPC call\nconst overrides: PricingOverride[] | undefined = getOverrides();\nconst { data } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing', {\n  base_price: 99.99,\n  ...(overrides && { pricing_overrides: overrides })\n});\n```\n\n## 5. Robust NULL/Empty Handling in SQL\n\n```sql\n-- Inside your function, always check both conditions\nIF pricing_overrides IS NULL OR array_length(pricing_overrides, 1) IS NULL THEN\n    -- No overrides provided\n    RETURN base_price;\nEND IF;\n\n-- Alternative: COALESCE for safe iteration\nFOREACH override IN ARRAY COALESCE(pricing_overrides, '{}')\nLOOP\n    -- Process each override\nEND LOOP;\n```\n\n## 6. Use `jsonb[]` for Complex Override Structures\n\nFor pricing overrides with multiple fields, `jsonb[]` is more flexible than simple typed arrays:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_final_price(\n    product_id uuid,\n    quantity integer,\n    price_overrides jsonb[] DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS jsonb\nLANGUAGE plpgsql\nAS $$\nDECLARE\n    override jsonb;\n    final_price numeric;\nBEGIN\n    -- Get base price\n    SELECT price INTO final_price FROM products WHERE id = product_id;\n    \n    -- Apply overrides if provided\n    IF price_overrides IS NOT NULL THEN\n        FOREACH override IN ARRAY price_overrides\n        LOOP\n            CASE override->>'type'\n                WHEN 'percentage_discount' THEN\n                    final_price := final_price * (1 - (override->>'value')::numeric / 100);\n                WHEN 'fixed_discount' THEN\n                    final_price := final_price - (override->>'value')::numeric;\n                WHEN 'override' THEN\n                    final_price := (override->>'value')::numeric;\n            END CASE;\n        END LOOP;\n    END IF;\n    \n    RETURN jsonb_build_object(\n        'unit_price', final_price,\n        'total', final_price * quantity\n    );\nEND;\n$$;\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Use `DEFAULT NULL`** for optional array parameters when \"not provided\" has semantic meaning\n2. **Always check for both `NULL` and empty arrays** in your function logic\n3. **Use `jsonb[]`** for complex pricing override structures\n4. **Leverage TypeScript types** on the client side for type safety\n5. **Omit the parameter** in the RPC call rather than passing `null` explicitly (Supabase handles this correctly)\n6. **Test edge cases**: no overrides, empty array, single override, multiple overrides","hint":"A correct answer should explain how to define the underlying PostgreSQL function used by Supabase RPC so that the array parameter is truly optional (e.g., with a default of NULL or an empty array and server-side logic that distinguishes “no overrides” from “apply these overrides”), and how to pass/omit that array from the Supabase client SDK in a type-safe way (e.g., typed array/JSONB, named parameters) without breaking existing calls.[[1]] It should also mention handling edge cases like empty arrays vs missing parameters, ensuring backwards compatibility for existing clients, and validating the override data before applying pricing logic.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","timestamp":32032},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":32032},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012MWertPkDBaa69z3mVEPwf","status":"completed","timestamp":32032},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01DaJE4JEjtuXh2bSsgf1Vgu","status":"completed","timestamp":32032},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here are the **best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026**:\n\n## 1.

You can send images (and other files like PDFs) as part of your prompts to vision-capable models like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Basic Image Streaming in Node.js\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport fs from 'node:fs';\n\nasync function main() {\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5', // or 'openai/gpt-4o'\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: 'user',\n        content: [\n          { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },\n          { type: 'image', image: fs.readFileSync('./image.png') },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n\n  for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {\n    process.stdout.write(textPart);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Image Input Formats\n\nThe SDK accepts images in multiple formats:\n\n```typescript\n// Option 1: Buffer/Uint8Array (local files)\n{ type: 'image', image: fs.readFileSync('./image.png') }\n\n// Option 2: Base64 encoded string\n{ type: 'image', image: 'base64-encoded-string' }\n\n// Option 3: Base64 data URL\n{ type: 'image', image: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0...' }\n\n// Option 4: HTTP(S) URL\n{ type: 'image', image: 'https://example.com/image.png' }\n\n// Option 5: URL object\n{ type: 'image', image: new URL('https://example.com/image.png') }\n```\n\nYou can also specify the media type:\n```typescript\n{ \n  type: 'image', \n  image: imageBuffer,\n  mediaType: 'image/png'  // IANA media type\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Next.js App Router Implementation\n\n**Server Route (`app/api/chat/route.ts`):**\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText, convertToModelMessages, type UIMessage } from 'ai';\n\nexport const maxDuration = 30;\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: 'openai/gpt-4o',\n    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n**Client Component (`app/page.tsx`):**\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\nimport { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';\nimport { DefaultChatTransport } from 'ai';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const [input, setInput] = useState('');\n  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState('');\n  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({\n    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({ api: '/api/chat' }),\n  });\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    sendMessage({\n      role: 'user',\n      parts: [\n        // Add image if URL provided\n        ...(imageUrl.trim() \n          ?

File Upload with Data URLs\n\n```typescript\n// Helper to convert files to data URLs\nasync function convertFilesToDataURLs(files: FileList) {\n  return Promise.all(\n    Array.from(files).map(file =>\n      new Promise<{ type: 'file'; mediaType: string; url: string }>((resolve, reject) => {\n        const reader = new FileReader();\n        reader.onload = () => resolve({\n          type: 'file',\n          mediaType: file.type,\n          url: reader.result as string,\n        });\n        reader.onerror = reject;\n        reader.readAsDataURL(file);\n      })\n    )\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in form submit\nconst fileParts = files ? await convertFilesToDataURLs(files) : [];\nsendMessage({\n  role: 'user',\n  parts: [{ type: 'text', text: input }, ...fileParts],\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Message Content Structure\n\nThe SDK supports rich multimodal content through the `content` array:\n\n**User messages can include:**\n- `TextPart`: `{ type: 'text', text: string }`\n- `ImagePart`: `{ type: 'image', image: string | Uint8Array | Buffer | URL, mediaType?: string }`\n- `FilePart`: `{ type: 'file', data: string | Uint8Array | URL, mediaType: string }`\n\n---\n\n### 6.

{"id":"websearch-844","input":"What are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","output":"What are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?\nBased on the latest Android developer documentation (updated February 2026), here are the **2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key Guidelines\n\n### 1. **Edge-to-Edge is Now Mandatory**\n- Apps targeting **SDK 35+** on Android 15+ devices are **automatically displayed edge-to-edge**\n- The window spans the entire display, drawing behind system bars (status bar, navigation bar, caption bar)\n- Edge-to-edge is no longer optional—it's the default behavior\n\n### 2. **Enabling Edge-to-Edge**\n```kotlin\n// Automatic for SDK 35+ on Android 15+\n// For backward compatibility, call in onCreate():\nWindowCompat.enableEdgeToEdge(window)\n```\n\n### 3. **Handling Insets Types**\n\n**System Bars Insets** (most common):\n- Use for tappable views that shouldn't be obscured by system bars\n- Apply via `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars()`\n\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n    v.updateLayoutParams<MarginLayoutParams> {\n        leftMargin = insets.left\n        bottomMargin = insets.bottom\n        rightMargin = insets.right\n    }\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n**System Gesture Insets** (for gesture navigation):\n- Use `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures()` for areas where system gestures take priority\n- Contains: bottom inset for home gesture, left/right insets for back gestures\n- Essential for swipeable views, bottom sheets, carousels, and `ViewPager2`\n\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { view, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures())\n    view.updatePadding(insets.left, insets.top, insets.right, insets.bottom)\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Jetpack Compose (Recommended)**\n```kotlin\n// Basic approach\nBox(Modifier.safeDrawingPadding()) {\n    // app content\n}\n\n// More granular control\nModifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.safeDrawing)\nModifier.imePadding()  // For keyboard handling\n```\n\n### 5. **Navigation Bar Specifics**\n- **Gesture navigation**: Transparent by default\n- **3-button navigation**: Gets a translucent scrim by default\n- To disable the 3-button scrim: `Window.setNavigationBarContrastEnforced(false)`\n\n### 6. **Backward Compatible Inset Dispatching**\nFor Android 10 and earlier, use:\n```kotlin\nViewGroupCompat.installCompatInsetsDispatch(rootView)\n```\nThis ensures insets dispatch correctly to sibling views.\n\n### 7. **System Bar Protection (New in 2026)**\nFor translucent system bars, wrap layouts in `ProtectionLayout`:\n```kotlin\nfindViewById<ProtectionLayout>(R.id.list_protection)\n    .setProtections(\n        listOf(GradientProtection(WindowInsetsCompat.Side.TOP, backgroundColor))\n    )\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n1. **Top app bars**: Stretch to top edge, display behind status bar\n2. **Bottom navigation**: Stretch to bottom edge, display behind navigation bar\n3. **Scrolling content**: Set `clipToPadding=\"false\"` on RecyclerView/NestedScrollView\n4. **Display cutouts**: Combine `systemBars() or displayCutout()` for comprehensive inset handling\n5. **Material Components**: Most automatically handle insets (`BottomAppBar`, `BottomNavigationView`, etc.), but `AppBarLayout` requires `android:fitsSystemWindows=\"true\"`","hint":"A correct answer must mention the modern Android edge-to-edge requirements (Android 15+ / 2026-era) and explain handling WindowInsets for both system bar insets and system gesture insets, including using safe drawing/gesture areas (e.g., WindowInsets.safeGestures / safeContent in Compose) to keep tappable content and app gestures out of the navigation bar’s gesture regions.[[1, 2,

view.updatePadding(insets.left, insets.top, insets.right, insets.bottom)\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Jetpack Compose (Recommended)**\n```kotlin\n// Basic approach\nBox(Modifier.safeDrawingPadding()) {\n    // app content\n}\n\n// More granular control\nModifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.safeDrawing)\nModifier.imePadding()  // For keyboard handling\n```\n\n### 5. **Navigation Bar Specifics**\n- **Gesture navigation**: Transparent by default\n- **3-button navigation**: Gets a translucent scrim by default\n- To disable the 3-button scrim: `Window.setNavigationBarContrastEnforced(false)`\n\n### 6. **Backward Compatible Inset Dispatching**\nFor Android 10 and earlier, use:\n```kotlin\nViewGroupCompat.installCompatInsetsDispatch(rootView)\n```\nThis ensures insets dispatch correctly to sibling views.\n\n### 7. **System Bar Protection (New in 2026)**\nFor translucent system bars, wrap layouts in `ProtectionLayout`:\n```kotlin\nfindViewById<ProtectionLayout>(R.id.list_protection)\n    .setProtections(\n        listOf(GradientProtection(WindowInsetsCompat.Side.TOP, backgroundColor))\n    )\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n1. **Top app bars**: Stretch to top edge, display behind status bar\n2. **Bottom navigation**: Stretch to bottom edge, display behind navigation bar\n3. **Scrolling content**: Set `clipToPadding=\"false\"` on RecyclerView/NestedScrollView\n4. **Display cutouts**: Combine `systemBars() or displayCutout()` for comprehensive inset handling\n5. **Material Components**: Most automatically handle insets (`BottomAppBar`, `BottomNavigationView`, etc.), but `AppBarLayout` requires `android:fitsSystemWindows=\"true\"`","timestamp":37466}],"metadata":{"category":"Documentation","subcategory":"Android_UI","lang":"Android","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770547734763,"end":1770547772229,"firstResponse":37466,"sessionCreation":0,"total":37466},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic:

Here's a complete guide for setting up Guacamole with Docker and PostgreSQL:\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Apache Guacamole with Docker and PostgreSQL (2025)\n\n### Overview\n\nYou'll need three Docker containers:\n1. **guacamole/guacd** - The guacd daemon (handles VNC, RDP, SSH, telnet)\n2. **guacamole/guacamole** - The web application (Tomcat 9.x)\n3. **postgres** - PostgreSQL database for authentication and connection storage\n\n### Method 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)\n\nCreate a `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.8'\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres-data:\n  initdb:  # Shared volume for database initialization\n\nnetworks:\n  guacamole-net:\n    driver: bridge\n\nservices:\n  # PostgreSQL Database\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres:15\n    container_name: guacamole-postgres\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES_USER: guacamole_user\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_secure_password  # Change this!\n    volumes:\n      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n      - initdb:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro\n    networks:\n      - guacamole-net\n\n  # Guacd (Guacamole Daemon)\n  guacd:\n    image: guacamole/guacd\n    container_name: guacamole-guacd\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    networks:\n      - guacamole-net\n\n  # Guacamole Web Application\n  guacamole:\n    image: guacamole/guacamole\n    container_name: guacamole-web\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    depends_on:\n      - guacd\n      - postgres\n    environment:\n      GUACD_HOSTNAME: guacd\n      POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRESQL_USER: guacamole_user\n      POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD: your_secure_password  # Match above!\n    volumes:\n      - initdb:/opt/guacamole/extensions/guacamole-auth-jdbc/postgresql/schema:ro\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    networks:\n      - guacamole-net\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup\n\n**Step 1: Create the Docker network and start containers initially**\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\n**Step 2: Initialize the database schema**\n\nThe first time you run, you need to initialize the database. Use the built-in script:\n\n```bash\n# Generate and apply the initialization SQL\ndocker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql | \\\n    docker exec -i guacamole-postgres psql -U guacamole_user -d guacamole_db\n```\n\n**Step 3: Restart Guacamole to apply changes**\n```bash\ndocker compose restart guacamole\n```\n\n**Step 4: Access Guacamole**\n- Open: `http://your-server-ip:8080/guacamole/`\n- Default login: **guacadmin** / **guacadmin**\n- ⚠️ **Change this password immediately after first login!**\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Manual Docker Commands\n\n```bash\n# 1.

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"How to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","output":"How to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?\nLet me search for more specific information about HumanInterrupt types:\nNow I have comprehensive information. Let me provide you with a complete guide on using LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object.\n\n---\n\n# LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume in Python (2026)\n\n## Overview\n\nLangGraph provides a powerful human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanism using the `interrupt()` function and `Command` object. This allows you to pause graph execution, collect human input, and resume seamlessly.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. Basic `interrupt()` Function\n\nThe `interrupt()` function pauses graph execution and returns a value to the caller:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    approved: bool\n\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval - payload shows up in result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n    approved = interrupt(\"Do you approve this action?\")\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n\n# Build graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"approval\", approval_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"approval\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"approval\", END)\n\n# Compile with checkpointer (required for interrupts)\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Run until interrupt\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"thread-1\"}}\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": \"data\"}, config=config)\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])  # [Interrupt(value='Do you approve this action?')]\n\n# Resume with human response\nfinal = graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\nprint(final[\"approved\"])  # True\n```\n\n### 2. HumanInterrupt Types (Structured Interrupts)\n\nFor more sophisticated workflows, use the `HumanInterrupt` schema:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Literal, Optional, Union\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n\n# Define the schemas\nclass HumanInterruptConfig(TypedDict):\n    allow_ignore: bool\n    allow_respond: bool\n    allow_edit: bool\n    allow_accept: bool\n\nclass ActionRequest(TypedDict):\n    action: str\n    args: dict\n\nclass HumanInterrupt(TypedDict):\n    action_request: ActionRequest\n    config: HumanInterruptConfig\n    description: Optional[str]\n\nclass HumanResponse(TypedDict):\n    type: Literal['accept', 'ignore', 'response', 'edit']\n    args: Union[None, str, ActionRequest]\n```\n\n### 3. Using HumanInterrupt with Command\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Literal, Optional, Union\n\nclass HumanInterruptConfig(TypedDict):\n    allow_ignore: bool\n    allow_respond: bool\n    allow_edit: bool\n    allow_accept: bool\n\nclass ActionRequest(TypedDict):\n    action: str\n    args: dict\n\nclass HumanInterrupt(TypedDict):\n    action_request: ActionRequest\n    config: HumanInterruptConfig\n    description: Optional[str]\n\nclass HumanResponse(TypedDict):\n    type: Literal['accept', 'ignore', 'response', 'edit']\n    args: Union[None, str, ActionRequest]\n\nclass MyState(TypedDict):\n    messages: list\n    result: Optional[str]\n\ndef tool_approval_node(state: MyState):\n    # Create a structured interrupt request\n    request: HumanInterrupt = {\n        \"action_request\": {\n            \"action\": \"send_email\",\n            \"args\": {\n                \"to\": \"alice@example.com\",\n                \"subject\": \"Meeting Tomorrow\",\n                \"body\": \"Hi Alice, let's meet tomorrow at 3pm.\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"config\": {\n            \"allow_ignore\": True,\n            \"allow_respond\": True,\n            \"allow_edit\": True,\n            \"allow_accept\": True\n        },\n        \"description\": \"## Email Preview\\n\\nPlease review this email before sending.\"\n    }\n    \n    # Interrupt returns a list; extract first response\n    response: HumanResponse = interrupt(request)[0]\n    \n    if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n        # User accepted - proceed with original args\n        return {\"result\": f\"Email sent with original args: {response['args']}\"}\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n        # User edited the args\n        edited_args = response[\"args\"]\n        return {\"result\": f\"Email sent with edited args: {edited_args}\"}\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"response\":\n        # User provided a text response\n        return {\"result\": f\"User responded: {response['args']}\"}\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"ignore\":\n        # User ignored/cancelled\n        return {\"result\": \"Action cancelled by user\"}\n\n# Build and compile graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(MyState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"approval\", tool_approval_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"approval\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"approval\", END)\n\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Usage\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"email-workflow-1\"}}\n\n# Initial run - hits interrupt\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [], \"result\": None}, config=config)\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])  # Shows the HumanInterrupt request\n\n# Resume with different response types:\n\n# Option 1: Accept\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"accept\", \"args\": result[\"__interrupt__\"][0].value[\"action_request\"]}]),\n    config=config\n)\n\n# Option 2: Edit\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\n        \"type\": \"edit\",\n        \"args\": {\"action\": \"send_email\", \"args\": {\"to\": \"bob@example.com\", \"subject\": \"Updated Subject\", \"body\": \"New body\"}}\n    }]),\n    config=config\n)\n\n# Option 3: Respond with text\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"response\", \"args\": \"Please add a meeting link\"}]),\n    config=config\n)\n\n# Option 4: Ignore/Cancel\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"ignore\", \"args\": None}]),\n    config=config\n)\n```\n\n### 4. Routing with Command\n\nUse `Command` to control graph flow after an interrupt:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Literal\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Optional\n\nclass ApprovalState(TypedDict):\n    action_details: str\n    status: Optional[Literal[\"pending\", \"approved\", \"rejected\"]]\n\ndef approval_node(state: ApprovalState) -> Command[Literal[\"proceed\", \"cancel\"]]:\n    decision = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"Approve this action?\",\n        \"details\": state[\"action_details\"],\n    })\n    # Route based on decision\n    return Command(goto=\"proceed\" if decision else \"cancel\")\n\ndef proceed_node(state: ApprovalState):\n    return {\"status\": \"approved\"}\n\ndef cancel_node(state: ApprovalState):\n    return {\"status\": \"rejected\"}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(ApprovalState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"approval\", approval_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"proceed\", proceed_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"cancel\", cancel_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"approval\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"proceed\", END)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"cancel\", END)\n\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"approval-123\"}}\n\n# Run until interrupt\ninitial = graph.invoke(\n    {\"action_details\": \"Transfer $500\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n    config=config,\n)\n\n# Resume - True routes to \"proceed\", False routes to \"cancel\"\nfinal = graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\nprint(final[\"status\"])  # \"approved\"\n```\n\n### 5.

Let me provide you with a complete guide on using LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object.\n\n---\n\n# LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume in Python (2026)\n\n## Overview\n\nLangGraph provides a powerful human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanism using the `interrupt()` function and `Command` object. This allows you to pause graph execution, collect human input, and resume seamlessly.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. Basic `interrupt()` Function\n\nThe `interrupt()` function pauses graph execution and returns a value to the caller:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    approved: bool\n\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval - payload shows up in result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n    approved = interrupt(\"Do you approve this action?\")\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n\n# Build graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"approval\", approval_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"approval\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"approval\", END)\n\n# Compile with checkpointer (required for interrupts)\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Run until interrupt\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"thread-1\"}}\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": \"data\"}, config=config)\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])  # [Interrupt(value='Do you approve this action?')]\n\n# Resume with human response\nfinal = graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\nprint(final[\"approved\"])  # True\n```\n\n### 2. HumanInterrupt Types (Structured Interrupts)\n\nFor more sophisticated workflows, use the `HumanInterrupt` schema:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Literal, Optional, Union\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n\n# Define the schemas\nclass HumanInterruptConfig(TypedDict):\n    allow_ignore: bool\n    allow_respond: bool\n    allow_edit: bool\n    allow_accept: bool\n\nclass ActionRequest(TypedDict):\n    action: str\n    args: dict\n\nclass HumanInterrupt(TypedDict):\n    action_request: ActionRequest\n    config: HumanInterruptConfig\n    description: Optional[str]\n\nclass HumanResponse(TypedDict):\n    type: Literal['accept', 'ignore', 'response', 'edit']\n    args: Union[None, str, ActionRequest]\n```\n\n### 3. Using HumanInterrupt with Command\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Literal, Optional, Union\n\nclass HumanInterruptConfig(TypedDict):\n    allow_ignore: bool\n    allow_respond: bool\n    allow_edit: bool\n    allow_accept: bool\n\nclass ActionRequest(TypedDict):\n    action: str\n    args: dict\n\nclass HumanInterrupt(TypedDict):\n    action_request: ActionRequest\n    config: HumanInterruptConfig\n    description: Optional[str]\n\nclass HumanResponse(TypedDict):\n    type: Literal['accept', 'ignore', 'response', 'edit']\n    args: Union[None, str, ActionRequest]\n\nclass MyState(TypedDict):\n    messages: list\n    result: Optional[str]\n\ndef tool_approval_node(state: MyState):\n    # Create a structured interrupt request\n    request: HumanInterrupt = {\n        \"action_request\": {\n            \"action\": \"send_email\",\n            \"args\": {\n                \"to\": \"alice@example.com\",\n                \"subject\": \"Meeting Tomorrow\",\n                \"body\": \"Hi Alice, let's meet tomorrow at 3pm.\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"config\": {\n            \"allow_ignore\": True,\n            \"allow_respond\": True,\n            \"allow_edit\": True,\n            \"allow_accept\": True\n        },\n        \"description\": \"## Email Preview\\n\\nPlease review this email before sending.\"\n    }\n    \n    # Interrupt returns a list; extract first response\n    response: HumanResponse = interrupt(request)[0]\n    \n    if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n        # User accepted - proceed with original args\n        return {\"result\": f\"Email sent with original args: {response['args']}\"}\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n        # User edited the args\n        edited_args = response[\"args\"]\n        return {\"result\": f\"Email sent with edited args: {edited_args}\"}\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"response\":\n        # User provided a text response\n        return {\"result\": f\"User responded: {response['args']}\"}\n    elif response[\"type\"] == \"ignore\":\n        # User ignored/cancelled\n        return {\"result\": \"Action cancelled by user\"}\n\n# Build and compile graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(MyState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"approval\", tool_approval_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"approval\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"approval\", END)\n\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Usage\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"email-workflow-1\"}}\n\n# Initial run - hits interrupt\nresult = graph.invoke({\"messages\": [], \"result\": None}, config=config)\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])  # Shows the HumanInterrupt request\n\n# Resume with different response types:\n\n# Option 1: Accept\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"accept\", \"args\": result[\"__interrupt__\"][0].value[\"action_request\"]}]),\n    config=config\n)\n\n# Option 2: Edit\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\n        \"type\": \"edit\",\n        \"args\": {\"action\": \"send_email\", \"args\": {\"to\": \"bob@example.com\", \"subject\": \"Updated Subject\", \"body\": \"New body\"}}\n    }]),\n    config=config\n)\n\n# Option 3: Respond with text\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"response\", \"args\": \"Please add a meeting link\"}]),\n    config=config\n)\n\n# Option 4: Ignore/Cancel\nfinal = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"ignore\", \"args\": None}]),\n    config=config\n)\n```\n\n### 4. Routing with Command\n\nUse `Command` to control graph flow after an interrupt:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Literal\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Optional\n\nclass ApprovalState(TypedDict):\n    action_details: str\n    status: Optional[Literal[\"pending\", \"approved\", \"rejected\"]]\n\ndef approval_node(state: ApprovalState) -> Command[Literal[\"proceed\", \"cancel\"]]:\n    decision = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"Approve this action?\",\n        \"details\": state[\"action_details\"],\n    })\n    # Route based on decision\n    return Command(goto=\"proceed\" if decision else \"cancel\")\n\ndef proceed_node(state: ApprovalState):\n    return {\"status\": \"approved\"}\n\ndef cancel_node(state: ApprovalState):\n    return {\"status\": \"rejected\"}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(ApprovalState)\nbuilder.add_node(\"approval\", approval_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"proceed\", proceed_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"cancel\", cancel_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"approval\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"proceed\", END)\nbuilder.add_edge(\"cancel\", END)\n\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"approval-123\"}}\n\n# Run until interrupt\ninitial = graph.invoke(\n    {\"action_details\": \"Transfer $500\", \"status\": \"pending\"},\n    config=config,\n)\n\n# Resume - True routes to \"proceed\", False routes to \"cancel\"\nfinal = graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\nprint(final[\"status\"])  # \"approved\"\n```\n\n### 5. Validating Human Input with Loop\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass FormState(TypedDict):\n    age: int | None\n\ndef get_age_node(state: FormState):\n    prompt = \"What is your age?\"\n    \n    while True:\n        answer = interrupt(prompt)\n        \n        if isinstance(answer, int) and answer > 0:\n            return {\"age\": answer}\n        \n        prompt = f\"'{answer}' is not valid.

Use `spawn` Start Method (Most Important)\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n# Set at the very beginning of your script\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n```\n\nOr use the context manager:\n```python\nctx = mp.get_context('spawn')\np = ctx.Process(target=worker_fn, args=(...))\n```\n\n### 2. Load Models in Main Process Before Spawning\n\n```python\n# CORRECT: Load in main process, then share\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint.pt'))\n    model.share_memory()  # Make model shareable across processes\n    \n    mp.spawn(worker_fn, args=(model,), nprocs=num_gpus)\n\n# WRONG: Loading inside child process can deadlock\ndef worker_fn(rank):\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint.pt'))  # Can deadlock!\n```\n\n### 3.

Format: `YYYYMMDD HHMMSSNNN,Bid,Ask,Volume`\n\n2. **Known Issues**:\n   - **No warranty on accuracy** - HistData explicitly states data is provided \"as-is\" without reliability guarantees\n   - **Volume data is always 0** - Forex tick data doesn't include meaningful volume\n   - **Gaps can occur** during low trading periods and market closures\n   - **Single liquidity provider source** - Data comes from one feed, not aggregated across multiple providers\n\n3. **Gap Reporting**: Each downloaded file includes a status report (`.txt` file) showing:\n   - Maximum gap found (in milliseconds)\n   - Average tick intervals\n   - Any significant gaps (in seconds)\n\n### Comparison to Premium Sources (e.g., Dukascopy)\n- **Dukascopy** is generally considered more reliable for professional backtesting\n- HistData is **free** while premium sources charge fees\n- For scalping strategies requiring tick-level precision, premium sources may be preferable\n- For general strategy validation and longer timeframe analysis, HistData can be adequate\n\n## 2026 Data Availability\n\n**Currently available**: Only **January 2026** data is available for XAUUSD tick data (as of my research date of February 8, 2026).\n\n### Potential Gaps in 2026 Data\n- Since only one month (January 2026) is currently available, the dataset is inherently incomplete for the year\n- To check for **intra-month gaps**, you would need to:\n  1. Download the file: `HISTDATA_COM_ASCII_XAUUSD_T_202601.zip`\n  2. Review the status report: `HISTDATA_COM_ASCII_XAUUSD_T_202601.txt`\n  3. Analyze the tick timestamps for expected market hours coverage\n\n### Expected Gap Patterns\nNormal gaps typically occur during:\n- Weekend market closures (Friday 5 PM - Sunday 5 PM EST)\n- Holiday periods\n- Low liquidity Asian session hours\n- Around news events (briefly)\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Always download and review the status report** for each file to assess gap severity\n2. **Cross-validate critical findings** with another data source if using for production strategies\n3. **For 2026 data**, check back monthly as HistData updates data regularly (last noted update: February 1, 2026)\n4.

Web push is not supported on earlier versions\n2. **HTTPS** - Your site must be served over a secure connection\n3. **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Users must add your site to their Home Screen\n4. **Service Worker** - Required to handle push events\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"AppName\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important:** The `display` property must be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` for iOS web push to work.\n\nLink the manifest in your HTML:\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Generate VAPID Keys\n\nGenerate a VAPID keypair for push authentication:\n\n```bash\n# Using OpenSSL\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out private_key.pem\nopenssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 65 | base64 | tr '/+' '_-' | tr -d '='\n```\n\nOr use a library like `web-push` (Node.js):\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Service Worker (`sw.js`)\n\n```javascript\n// sw.js\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  const data = event.data ? event.data.json() : {};\n  \n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || 'You have a new notification',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: data.badge || '/icons/badge-72x72.png',\n    data: data.url || '/',\n    vibrate: [100, 50, 100],\n    actions: data.actions || []\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data.title || 'Notification', options)\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.matchAll({ type: 'window', includeUncontrolled: true })\n      .then(function(clientList) {\n        const url = event.notification.data;\n        \n        // If a window is already open, focus it\n        for (const client of clientList) {\n          if (client.url === url && 'focus' in client) {\n            return client.focus();\n          }\n        }\n        \n        // Otherwise, open a new window\n        if (clients.openWindow) {\n          return clients.openWindow(url);\n        }\n      })\n  );\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Register Service Worker and Request Permission\n\n**Critical for iOS:** Permission requests must be triggered by a user gesture (click/tap event).\n\n```javascript\n// app.js\nconst VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';\n\n// Check if push notifications are supported\nfunction isPushSupported() {\n  return 'serviceWorker' in navigator && \n         'PushManager' in window && \n         'Notification' in window;\n}\n\n// Check if running as installed PWA (required for iOS)\nfunction isInstalledPWA() {\n  return window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches ||\n         window.navigator.standalone === true;\n}\n\n// Register service worker\nasync function registerServiceWorker() {\n  try {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');\n    console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    return registration;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert VAPID key to Uint8Array\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 -

Send Push Notifications\n\nExample using Node.js with `web-push`:\n\n```javascript\n// server.js\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  process.env.VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY,\n  process.env.VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY\n);\n\nasync function sendPushNotification(subscription, payload) {\n  try {\n    await webpush.sendNotification(subscription, JSON.stringify(payload));\n    console.log('Push notification sent successfully');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error sending push notification:', error);\n    \n    // Handle expired subscriptions\n    if (error.statusCode === 410) {\n      // Remove subscription from database\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Example payload\nconst payload = {\n  title: 'New Message',\n  body: 'You have a new message!',\n  icon: '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n  url: '/messages'\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Guide Users to Add to Home Screen\n\nCreate an \"Add to Home Screen\" prompt for iOS users:\n\n```javascript\nfunction showAddToHomeScreenPrompt() {\n  const isIOS = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent);\n  const isInStandaloneMode = window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches \n                             || window.navigator.standalone;\n  \n  if (isIOS && !isInStandaloneMode) {\n    // Show custom banner with instructions\n    const banner = document.createElement('div');\n    banner.innerHTML = `\n      <div class=\"add-to-home-banner\">\n        <p>To enable notifications, add this app to your Home Screen:</p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>Tap the <strong>Share</strong> button (📤)</li>\n          <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>\"Add to Home Screen\"</strong></li>\n          <li>Tap <strong>\"Add\"</strong> to confirm</li>\n        </ol>\n        <button onclick=\"this.parentElement.remove()\">Got it</button>\n      </div>\n    `;\n    document.body.appendChild(banner);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key iOS Safari Limitations\n\n| Limitation | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| **Home Screen Required** | Push only works when PWA is installed on Home Screen |\n| **User Gesture Required** | Permission must be requested from click/tap event |\n| **No Background Sync** | Limited background capabilities compared to Android |\n| **No Badge API** | Cannot update app icon badges on iOS |\n| **Safari Only** | Third-party browsers on iOS don't support web push |\n\n---\n\n### Testing Checklist\n\n1. ✅ Site served over HTTPS\n2. ✅ Valid `manifest.json` with `display: \"standalone\"`\n3. ✅ Service worker registered successfully\n4. ✅ App added to Home Screen\n5. ✅ Permission requested via user gesture (button click)\n6. ✅ Push subscription sent to backend\n7. ✅ Notifications display when app is closed\n\nThis setup enables web push notifications on iOS Safari 16.4+ for PWAs installed on the user's Home Screen.","timestamp":42910}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Web_API","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770548610669,"end":1770548653579,"firstResponse":42910,"sessionCreation":0,"total":42910},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Let me compile a complete tutorial for you.\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Guide)\n\nThis guide covers setting up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo with **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Next.js**. The shadcn CLI now has native monorepo support, making setup much easier than before.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js** v18+ (v20+ recommended)\n- **Package Manager**: pnpm, npm, yarn, or bun (pnpm or bun recommended)\n- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript\n\n---\n\n## Option 1: Create a New Monorepo (Recommended for New Projects)\n\n### Step 1: Initialize the Monorepo\n\nRun the shadcn init command and select the monorepo option:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using yarn\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select **\"Next.js (Monorepo)\"** option.\n\nThis creates a complete monorepo structure with:\n- **Turborepo** as the build system\n- Two workspaces: `apps/web` and `packages/ui`\n- **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS v4** pre-configured\n- Properly configured `components.json` files\n\n### Step 2: Project Structure\n\nAfter initialization, your project structure will look like this:\n\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/                    # Next.js application\n│       ├── app/\n│       ├── components/\n│       ├── components.json     # App-specific config\n│       └── package.json\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/                     # Shared UI components\n│       ├── src/\n│       │   ├── components/\n│       │   ├── hooks/\n│       │   └── lib/\n│       ├── components.json     # UI package config\n│       └── package.json\n├── turbo.json\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml         # (if using pnpm)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Add shadcn/ui to an Existing Turborepo\n\n### Step 1: Navigate to Your App Directory\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web  # or your Next.js app directory\n```\n\n### Step 2: Initialize shadcn/ui\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nSelect **monorepo** when prompted and follow the configuration wizard.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the UI Package\n\nCreate or update `packages/ui/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate or update `apps/web/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"app/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Important**: For Tailwind CSS v4, leave the `tailwind.config` field empty (as shown above).\n\n### Step 4: Install Tailwind CSS v4 in UI Package\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\nCreate `packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n\n### Step 5: Configure TypeScript Paths\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@workspace/ui/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Adding Components\n\n### Add Components to the UI Package\n\nRun commands from your **app directory** (e.g., `apps/web`):\n\n```bash\n# Add a single component\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\n\n# Add multiple components\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input label\n\n# Add a complete block (e.g., login form)\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add login-01\n```\n\nThe CLI automatically:\n- Installs UI components (button, card, etc.) to `packages/ui/src/components`\n- Installs page components/blocks to `apps/web/components`\n- Sets up correct import paths\n\n---\n\n## Using Components in Your App\n\n### Import from @workspace/ui\n\n```tsx\n// In apps/web/app/page.tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\";\nimport { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>Welcome</CardTitle>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button>Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Import Hooks and Utilities\n\n```tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\";\nimport { useMediaQuery } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-media-query\";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Package Configuration Examples\n\n### packages/ui/package.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n    \"./styles/*\": \"./src/styles/*.css\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^4.0.0\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": \"^4.0.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.400.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### pnpm-workspace.yaml (root)\n\n```yaml\npackages:\n  - \"apps/*\"\n  - \"packages/*\"\n```\n\n### turbo.json (root)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://turbo.build/schema.json\",\n  \"tasks\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"],\n      \"outputs\": [\".next/**\", \"!.next/cache/**\", \"dist/**\"]\n    },\n    \"dev\": {\n      \"cache\": false,\n      \"persistent\": true\n    },\n    \"lint\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^lint\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| **components.json in each workspace** | Both `apps/web` and `packages/ui` need their own `components.json` |\n| **Matching styles** | Use the same `style`, `iconLibrary`, and `baseColor` in all `components.json` files |\n| **Tailwind v4 config** | Leave `tailwind.config` empty for Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| **Proper aliases** | Configure aliases to point to `@workspace/ui/*` paths |\n\n---\n\n## Running the Monorepo\n\n```bash\n# Development (runs all apps)\npnpm dev\n\n# Build all packages\npnpm build\n\n# Run specific app\npnpm --filter web dev\n\n# Add dependency to specific package\npnpm --filter @workspace/ui add some-package\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Components not styled correctly?\n- Ensure your app imports the global CSS: `import \"@workspace/ui/styles/globals.css\"`\n- Verify Tailwind is scanning the UI package in your app's CSS config\n\n### Import errors?\n- Check that `paths` in `tsconfig.json` match your aliases\n- Verify the package name matches (`@workspace/ui` or your custom name)\n\n### CLI installs to wrong location?\n- Run the `add` command from your **app directory**, not the root\n- Ensure `components.json` files have correct alias configurations\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo)\n- [Turborepo shadcn/ui

  ├── hooks/\n│       │   └── lib/\n│       ├── components.json     # UI package config\n│       └── package.json\n├── turbo.json\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml         # (if using pnpm)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Add shadcn/ui to an Existing Turborepo\n\n### Step 1: Navigate to Your App Directory\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web  # or your Next.js app directory\n```\n\n### Step 2: Initialize shadcn/ui\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nSelect **monorepo** when prompted and follow the configuration wizard.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the UI Package\n\nCreate or update `packages/ui/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate or update `apps/web/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"app/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Important**: For Tailwind CSS v4, leave the `tailwind.config` field empty (as shown above).\n\n### Step 4: Install Tailwind CSS v4 in UI Package\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\nCreate `packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n\n### Step 5: Configure TypeScript Paths\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@workspace/ui/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Adding Components\n\n### Add Components to the UI Package\n\nRun commands from your **app directory** (e.g., `apps/web`):\n\n```bash\n# Add a single component\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\n\n# Add multiple components\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input label\n\n# Add a complete block (e.g., login form)\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add login-01\n```\n\nThe CLI automatically:\n- Installs UI components (button, card, etc.) to `packages/ui/src/components`\n- Installs page components/blocks to `apps/web/components`\n- Sets up correct import paths\n\n---\n\n## Using Components in Your App\n\n### Import from @workspace/ui\n\n```tsx\n// In apps/web/app/page.tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\";\nimport { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>Welcome</CardTitle>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button>Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Import Hooks and Utilities\n\n```tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\";\nimport { useMediaQuery } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-media-query\";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Package Configuration Examples\n\n### packages/ui/package.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n    \"./styles/*\": \"./src/styles/*.css\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^4.0.0\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": \"^4.0.0\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.400.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### pnpm-workspace.yaml (root)\n\n```yaml\npackages:\n  - \"apps/*\"\n  - \"packages/*\"\n```\n\n### turbo.json (root)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://turbo.build/schema.json\",\n  \"tasks\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"],\n      \"outputs\": [\".next/**\", \"!.next/cache/**\", \"dist/**\"]\n    },\n    \"dev\": {\n      \"cache\": false,\n      \"persistent\": true\n    },\n    \"lint\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^lint\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| **components.json in each workspace** | Both `apps/web` and `packages/ui` need their own `components.json` |\n| **Matching styles** | Use the same `style`, `iconLibrary`, and `baseColor` in all `components.json` files |\n| **Tailwind v4 config** | Leave `tailwind.config` empty for Tailwind CSS v4 |\n| **Proper aliases** | Configure aliases to point to `@workspace/ui/*` paths |\n\n---\n\n## Running the Monorepo\n\n```bash\n# Development (runs all apps)\npnpm dev\n\n# Build all packages\npnpm build\n\n# Run specific app\npnpm --filter web dev\n\n# Add dependency to specific package\npnpm --filter @workspace/ui add some-package\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Components not styled correctly?\n- Ensure your app imports the global CSS: `import \"@workspace/ui/styles/globals.css\"`\n- Verify Tailwind is scanning the UI package in your app's CSS config\n\n### Import errors?\n- Check that `paths` in `tsconfig.json` match your aliases\n- Verify the package name matches (`@workspace/ui` or your custom name)\n\n### CLI installs to wrong location?\n- Run the `add` command from your **app directory**, not the root\n- Ensure `components.json` files have correct alias configurations\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo)\n- [Turborepo shadcn/ui

Key Points for Next.js Image + Swiper\n\n| Feature | Implementation |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Full Width** | Use `fill` prop on `<Image>` + parent with `position: relative` |\n| **Responsive** | Set `sizes=\"100vw\"` for full viewport width |\n| **Aspect Ratio** | Use CSS `aspect-ratio` or fixed height on container |\n| **Performance** | Add `priority` to first slide for faster LCP |\n| **Client Component** | Add `'use client'` directive (Swiper requires client-side JS) |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Custom Styling (Optional - Tailwind CSS)\n\n```css\n/* globals.css */\n.swiper-button-next,\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: white !important;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  background: white !important;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. Responsive Breakpoints (Optional)\n\n```tsx\n<Swiper\n  breakpoints={{\n    640: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    768: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    1024: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n  }}\n  // ... other props\n>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Common Issues & Solutions\n\n1. **Slider not showing**: Ensure CSS imports are in your layout file\n2. **Images not filling**: Use `fill` prop + `position: relative` on parent\n3. **Hydration errors**: Add `'use client'` directive to the component\n4. **Navigation arrows not visible**: Override default Swiper styles with your theme colors\n\nThis approach gives you a performant, SEO-friendly, and fully responsive image slider that leverages Next.js Image optimization while using Swiper's robust slider functionality.","hint":"A correct answer should describe using Swiper’s React integration with Next.js in a client component (`'use client'`), importing `Swiper`/`SwiperSlide` and Swiper CSS, and rendering slides that use the Next.js `Image` component (typically with `fill`/responsive layout and parent with relative positioning) to achieve a full-width, responsive slider; it should also mention configuring Swiper options (e.g., breakpoints or `slidesPerView`, navigation/pagination) so the slider adapts to different screen sizes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":28336},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":28336},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PTdxzEoVvEM8ivoYVWUjhn","status":"completed","timestamp":28336},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on how to build a **full-width responsive image slider using Next.js Image component and Swiper (2026)**:\n\n---\n\n## Full-Width Responsive Image Slider with Next.js + Swiper\n\n### 1.

Key options include:\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `vad_events` | **DEPRECATED** (as of v0.0.99) - Enable VAD events for speech detection.

Pipecat recommends using **Silero VAD** instead for voice activity detection.\n\n---\n\n## DeepgramFluxSTTService (Advanced/Recommended)\n\nThe newer `DeepgramFluxSTTService` provides advanced conversational AI capabilities with these VAD/utterance `InputParams`:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| `eager_eot_threshold` | `float` | Controls EagerEndOfTurn aggressiveness. Lower = faster response (more LLM calls), Higher = more conservative (fewer calls). Off by default. |\n| `eot_threshold` | `float` | End-of-turn confidence required to finish a turn (default: 0.7). Lower = turns end sooner, Higher = more complete utterances. |\n| `eot_timeout_ms` | `int` | Time in ms after speech to force turn end regardless of EOT confidence (default: 5000ms). |\n| `min_confidence` | `float` | Minimum confidence required to create a TranscriptionFrame. |\n| `keyterm` | `list` | Keywords to boost recognition accuracy. |\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nparams = DeepgramFluxSTTService.InputParams(\n    eager_eot_threshold=0.5,  # Enable eager end-of-turn\n    eot_threshold=0.8,        # Higher confidence for complete utterances\n    eot_timeout_ms=3000,      # 3 second timeout\n)\nstt = DeepgramFluxSTTService(api_key=\"...\", params=params)\n```\n\n**Summary:** For 2026, the recommended approach is to use `DeepgramFluxSTTService` with `InputParams` for turn detection, or use `DeepgramSTTService` with external **Silero VAD** since Deepgram's native `vad_events` is deprecated.","timestamp":37428}],"metadata":{"category":"Documentation","subcategory":"Pipecat","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770549509024,"end":1770549546452,"firstResponse":37428,"sessionCreation":0,"total":37428},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

This appeals to Gen Z and Gen Alpha users seeking authenticity and escaping the pressure of performative social media.\n\n3. **Celebrity Lockets Feature**: Launched in late 2025, this feature allows celebrities to connect directly with fans through their home screens, leveraging celebrity influence to expand their user base.\n\n4. **Gen Alpha Focus with \"Rollcall\"**: The Rollcall feature encourages weekly photo sharing using Apple's Live Activities on Lock Screens. Over 80% of Rollcall's early adopters are Gen Alpha, positioning Locket as this generation's primary social platform.\n\n5. **Privacy & Intimacy-First Messaging**: The strategy emphasizes emotional connection with a limited friend circle (up to 20 friends), appealing to users who want meaningful interactions over mass broadcasting.\n\nThe overall narrative is one of organic, authentic growth through word-of-mouth and strategic platform-native content rather than traditional advertising.","hint":"To earn full credit, an answer must explain that Locket (Locket Widget) is a photo-sharing widget app that grew via a deliberate TikTok- and influencer-driven marketing strategy, and describe the “story behind” that strategy—how content from many small creators/nano-influencers using similar video formats and trends on TikTok/short-form platforms was used to drive virality, App Store rankings, and sustained user growth, including at least one concrete element such as use of custom sounds, standardized video formats, or large-scale nano-influencer campaigns.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What is the story behind the Locket widget marketing strategy in 2026?","timestamp":20005},{"type":"message","content":"I'll search the web for information about Locket widget's marketing strategy in 2026.","timestamp":20005},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":20005},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AtKqqwER4qwkNUhxvpfQzX","status":"completed","timestamp":20005},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's the story behind Locket widget's marketing strategy in 2026:\n\n## Locket Widget Marketing Strategy in 2026\n\n**The Origin Story:**\nLocket was created by Matt Moss originally as a personal app for his girlfriend during a long-distance relationship in 2021.

Railway (and Docker) cannot execute `cd` directly as a start command.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. **Remove the Custom Start Command** (Most Common Fix)\nIf you have a start command like `cd /app && node server.js` in your Railway service settings:\n- Go to your Railway service **Settings**\n- Find the **Start Command** field\n- **Remove or clear** the start command entirely\n- Let Railway use the `CMD` from your Dockerfile instead\n\n### 2. **Use `WORKDIR` in Your Dockerfile**\nInstead of using `cd` to change directories, set the working directory in your Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Instead of trying to cd at runtime\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Your files will be relative to /app\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm install\n\n# This runs from /app automatically\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n```\n\n### 3. **If You Must Change Directories at Runtime**\nWrap the command in a shell:\n\n```dockerfile\nCMD [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"cd /app && node server.js\"]\n```\n\nOr in Railway's start command field:\n```\nsh -c \"cd /app && node server.js\"\n```\n\n### 4. **Check Your Base Image**\nEnsure you're using an appropriate base image that includes a shell. Minimal images like `scratch` or `distroless` may not have basic shell utilities.\n\n## Quick Checklist\n1. ✅ Remove any `cd` commands from Railway's Start Command setting\n2. ✅ Use `WORKDIR` directive in your Dockerfile\n3. ✅ Ensure your `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` doesn't start with `cd`\n4. ✅ If your Dockerfile has no `CMD`, add one or configure the start command properly in Railway","hint":"A correct answer must explain that the error occurs because Railway is trying to run `cd` as the container’s start executable (from the Start Command or Dockerfile `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`), and must state that the fix is to change that start command so the executable is a real binary (e.g., `node`, `python`, etc.) and any directory changes or shell logic are handled via a proper shell invocation (like `/bin/sh -c \"cd … && <command>\"`) or removed.[[1, 2, 3]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I fix the \"cd could not be found\" error when a Railway container fails to start in 2026?","timestamp":23711},{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about this Railway deployment error to provide you with the most accurate solution.","timestamp":23712},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":23712},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CQAvhFioxR1VVK7UiXrQjQ","status":"completed","timestamp":23712},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's how to fix the **\"cd could not be found\"** error when a Railway container fails to start:\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe error occurs because `cd` is a **shell built-in command**, not a standalone executable.

It fires when the checkbox value changes and provides access to `e.target.checked`.\n\n4. **Controlled vs Uncontrolled**: Use controlled components (with `checked` and `onChange`) for predictable state management. Avoid uncontrolled checkboxes unless you have a specific reason.\n\n5. **Accessibility**: Always associate labels with checkboxes. This ensures clicking the label toggles the checkbox and improves screen reader support.\n\n### Handling Multiple Checkboxes\n\n```jsx\nconst [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState({\n  option1: false,\n  option2: false,\n  option3: false,\n});\n\nconst handleChange = (e) => {\n  const { name, checked } = e.target;\n  setSelectedItems(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: checked }));\n};\n\n// Usage\n<label>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"option1\" checked={selectedItems.option1} onChange={handleChange} />\n  Option 1\n</label>\n```\n\n### When You Might Use onClick\n\nIf you need to handle clicks on a custom checkbox component or trigger additional logic:\n\n```jsx\nconst handleClick = (e) => {\n  // Prevent double-firing if label wraps input\n  e.stopPropagation();\n  // Custom logic here\n};\n\n<label onClick={handleClick}>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n  Custom checkbox\n</label>\n```\n\n**Summary**: In 2026, the standard approach remains using controlled components with `onChange`, proper label association via `htmlFor` or wrapping, and maintaining checkbox state with `useState`. Use `onClick` only for additional custom behavior, not for managing the checkbox state itself.","hint":"A strong answer should explain that in modern React you normally handle checkbox interaction with a controlled component using the `checked` prop and `onChange` (not `onClick`) on the `<input type=\"checkbox\">`, and use a `<label>` correctly associated via `htmlFor`/`id` (or wrapping the input) so clicks on the label toggle the checkbox while preserving keyboard and screen‑reader accessibility.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","timestamp":24224},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":24224},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HmtqcaGgsSS1Zad9iEFRs8","status":"completed","timestamp":24224},{"type":"message","content":"## React onClick Checkbox Label and Input Handling in 2026\n\nBased on current best practices, here's how to properly handle React onClick interactions for checkbox labels and inputs:\n\n### Best Practice: Use `onChange` with Controlled Components\n\nThe recommended approach in 2026 is to use **controlled components** with the `onChange` event (not `onClick`) for checkboxes:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction CheckboxExample() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)}\n      />\n      Subscribe to updates\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Use `htmlFor` instead of `for`**: In React/JSX, use `htmlFor` to associate labels with inputs:\n   ```jsx\n   <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"myCheckbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n   <label htmlFor=\"myCheckbox\">Click me</label>\n   ```\n\n2. **Wrap input inside label** (alternative approach): This automatically associates the label with the input without needing `htmlFor`:\n   ```jsx\n   <label>\n     <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n     Click me\n   </label>\n   ```\n\n3. **Prefer `onChange` over `onClick`**: For form inputs including checkboxes, `onChange` is the standard event handler.

The technique leverages the Windows `LoadLibraryEx` API with the `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` flag to load a \"decoy\" DLL without triggering its normal initialization routines.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works (Step-by-Step)\n\n#### **Phase 1: Target Process Setup**\n1. **Create or open a target process** - Attacker either spawns a new process (e.g., `notepad.exe`) or opens a handle to an existing one\n2. Optional: Apply PPID spoofing to make the process appear to have a legitimate parent\n\n#### **Phase 2: Load the Decoy DLL**\n3. **Force the target process to load a legitimate DLL** using `LoadLibraryEx` with the critical flag:\n   ```c\n   LoadLibraryEx(\"amsi.dll\", NULL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES);\n   ```\n   \n   **Why `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` is crucial:**\n   - Prevents the DLL's `DllMain` from being called\n   - Skips resolving the DLL's import table\n   - Avoids triggering `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`, `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH`, etc.\n   - Without this flag, writing shellcode to the entry point causes it to execute multiple times (on each thread attach/detach), crashing the process\n\n#### **Phase 3: Locate Injection Point**\n4. **Find the DLL's entry point address** by parsing the PE headers:\n   ```c\n   PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER mzHeader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)hTargetDLL;\n   PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS peHeader = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((char*)hTargetDLL + mzHeader->e_lfanew);\n   void* entryPoint = (void*)((char*)hTargetDLL + peHeader->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);\n   ```\n\n5. **Alternative injection locations:**\n   - DLL entry point (`AddressOfEntryPoint`)\n   - Exported function addresses (e.g., `DllCanUnloadNow`)\n   - `.text` section of the DLL\n\n#### **Phase 4: Write Malicious Code**\n6. **Modify memory permissions** to allow writing:\n   ```c\n   VirtualProtect(entryPoint, shellcode_size, PAGE_READWRITE, &oldProtect);\n   ```\n\n7. **Overwrite the DLL code** with shellcode:\n   ```c\n   memcpy(entryPoint, shellcode, shellcode_size);\n   // Or for remote process:\n   WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, entryPoint, shellcode, shellcode_size, NULL);\n   ```\n\n8. **Restore original permissions**:\n   ```c\n   VirtualProtect(entryPoint, shellcode_size, oldProtect, &oldProtect);\n   ```\n\n#### **Phase 5: Execute**\n9. **Trigger execution** using various methods:\n   - `CreateThread` / `CreateRemoteThread`\n   - `QueueUserAPC`\n   - Thread hijacking\n\n---\n\n### The LoadLibraryEx Shim Trick (for Remote Injection)\n\nWhen injecting into a **remote process**, you can't simply pass the `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` flag because `CreateRemoteThread` only accepts one parameter. The solution is a small \"shim\" shellcode:\n\n**x64 Shim (22 bytes):**\n```asm\nmov rax, <LoadLibraryExA_address>  ; Address patched at runtime\nmov r8, 1                          ; DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES\nxor rdx, rdx                       ; hReservedNull = 0\njmp rax                            ; Jump to LoadLibraryExA\n```\n\n**x86 Shim (18 bytes):**\n```asm\nmov eax, <LoadLibraryExA_address>\npush 1                             ; DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES  \npush 0                             ; hReservedNull\npush [esp+12]                      ; lpFileName (passed from CreateRemoteThread)\ncall eax\nret 12\n```\n\n---\n\n### Why This Technique is Effective for Evasion\n\n| Advantage | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Legitimate memory backing** | Shellcode executes from a signed Microsoft DLL's memory region |\n| **Clean call stack** | Execution appears to originate from a trusted module |\n| **File system appears clean** | The DLL on disk is unmodified; malicious code exists only in memory |\n| **Bypasses some EDR hooks** | Many EDRs focus on suspicious memory allocations, not stomped legitimate modules |\n| **ETW evasion** | Reduces telemetry compared to classic `VirtualAllocEx` + `WriteProcessMemory` patterns |\n\n---\n\n### 2024 Improvements & Advanced Variants\n\n1. **Sleep Obfuscation with Module Restoration**\n   - Backup the original DLL content before stomping\n   - During \"sleep\" periods, restore the original code\n   - Before execution, re-stomp with shellcode\n   - This minimizes the detection window\n\n2. **Phantom DLL Hollowing** (CyberArk technique)\n   - Uses `NtCreateSection` to create a file-backed memory section\n   - Maps the section as a phantom/ghost image\n   - Even harder to detect because the memory appears legitimately backed\n\n3. **Transacted Hollowing**\n   - Combines with Process Doppelgänging/Ghosting\n   - Uses NTFS transactions to create ephemeral file states\n\n4. **Modern C2 Frameworks (e.g., Brute Ratel v1.5)**\n   - Overwrites only the `.text` section\n   - Uses `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` to prevent entry point crashes\n   - Results in null entry point (a detection indicator)\n\n---\n\n### Detection Indicators\n\n| Indicator | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Memory discrepancy | In-memory DLL content differs from on-disk version |\n| Null entry point | DLL loaded with `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` shows null entry point in PEB |\n| Unusual DLL loads | Process loads DLLs it wouldn't normally use (e.g., notepad loading `amsi.dll`) |\n| Private memory in image region | Modified sections appear as private memory, not image-backed |\n| Missing PEB entry | Some variants unlink the module from PEB loader lists |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nLoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing works by:\n1. Loading a legitimate DLL with `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` (preventing initialization)\n2. Overwriting the DLL's code (entry point or exported functions) with malicious shellcode\n3. Executing the shellcode from within the legitimate DLL's memory space\n\nThis creates a powerful evasion technique where malicious code runs under the guise of a trusted, signed Microsoft DLL, making forensic analysis and real-time detection significantly more challenging.","hint":"A good answer must explain that this is a decoy DLL / DLL hollowing or module-stomping style injection that uses LoadLibraryEx to load a benign DLL into a remote or current process, then overwrites or “hollows out” the loaded image’s code (e.g., at its entry point) in memory with malicious payload, and finally transfers execution to that payload to evade detection.

{"id":"websearch-1595","input":"What causes ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x when executing raw SQL and how to fix it with text() wrapper in 2026?","output":"What causes ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x when executing raw SQL and how to fix it with text() wrapper in 2026?\n## ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x: Cause and Fix\n\n### What Causes the Error\n\nIn **SQLAlchemy 2.x**, the `ObjectNotExecutableError` occurs when you try to execute a raw SQL string directly using the `execute()` method. This is a **breaking change from SQLAlchemy 1.x**, where passing plain strings was allowed.\n\n**The problem**: SQLAlchemy 2.x no longer accepts raw SQL strings as executable objects. The error message looks like:\n\n```\nsqlalchemy.exc.ObjectNotExecutableError: Not an executable object: 'SELECT * FROM users'\n```\n\n### Why This Changed\n\nSQLAlchemy 2.0 enforces stricter typing and explicit SQL construction. Raw strings are ambiguous - they could be table names, column names, or SQL statements. The `text()` wrapper explicitly marks a string as an executable SQL statement.\n\n### The Fix: Use `text()` Wrapper\n\n**Before (SQLAlchemy 1.x style - causes error in 2.x):**\n```python\n# This will raise ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x\nconnection.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\nsession.execute(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table\")\n```\n\n**After (SQLAlchemy 2.x compatible):**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\n# Wrap raw SQL in text()\nconnection.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\"))\nsession.execute(text(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table\"))\n```\n\n### Common Scenarios and Fixes\n\n**1. Basic SELECT queries:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(text(\"SELECT id, name FROM users LIMIT 10\"))\n    for row in result:\n        print(row)\n```\n\n**2. With parameters (use bound parameters for safety):**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(\n        text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id\"),\n        {\"user_id\": 42}\n    )\n```\n\n**3.

This is a **breaking change from SQLAlchemy 1.x**, where passing plain strings was allowed.\n\n**The problem**: SQLAlchemy 2.x no longer accepts raw SQL strings as executable objects. The error message looks like:\n\n```\nsqlalchemy.exc.ObjectNotExecutableError: Not an executable object: 'SELECT * FROM users'\n```\n\n### Why This Changed\n\nSQLAlchemy 2.0 enforces stricter typing and explicit SQL construction. Raw strings are ambiguous - they could be table names, column names, or SQL statements. The `text()` wrapper explicitly marks a string as an executable SQL statement.\n\n### The Fix: Use `text()` Wrapper\n\n**Before (SQLAlchemy 1.x style - causes error in 2.x):**\n```python\n# This will raise ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x\nconnection.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\nsession.execute(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table\")\n```\n\n**After (SQLAlchemy 2.x compatible):**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\n# Wrap raw SQL in text()\nconnection.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\"))\nsession.execute(text(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table\"))\n```\n\n### Common Scenarios and Fixes\n\n**1. Basic SELECT queries:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(text(\"SELECT id, name FROM users LIMIT 10\"))\n    for row in result:\n        print(row)\n```\n\n**2. With parameters (use bound parameters for safety):**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(\n        text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id\"),\n        {\"user_id\": 42}\n    )\n```\n\n**3. Async engine:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nasync with async_engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = await conn.execute(text(\"SELECT id, name FROM item LIMIT 50\"))\n```\n\n**4. With pandas `read_sql`:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# SQLAlchemy 2.x compatible\ndf = pd.read_sql(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\"), connection)\n```\n\n**5. DDL statements:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    conn.execute(text(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS alembic_version\"))\n    conn.commit()\n```\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Always import `text`**: `from sqlalchemy import text` or `from sqlalchemy.sql import text`\n2. **Wrap all raw SQL strings**: Every string passed to `execute()` must be wrapped in `text()`\n3. **Use bound parameters**: For security (SQL injection prevention), use `:param_name` syntax with a dictionary\n4. **Don't forget `commit()`**: In SQLAlchemy 2.x, autocommit is disabled by default for connections","timestamp":24513}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"SQLAlchemy","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770550198410,"end":1770550222923,"firstResponse":24513,"sessionCreation":0,"total":24513},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

This typically happens in **non-interactive environments** (CI/CD pipelines, piped input, non-TTY terminals).\n\n### Common Solutions:\n\n#### 1. **Check for TTY Before Using Raw Mode**\nIn your Ink application, detect if stdin is a TTY before enabling raw mode:\n\n```javascript\nimport { render } from 'ink';\n\n// Check if running in interactive terminal\nif (process.stdin.isTTY) {\n  render(<App />);\n} else {\n  // Handle non-interactive mode differently\n  render(<App />, { stdin: undefined });\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. **Use Ink's Built-in CI Detection**\nInk automatically detects CI environments.

Dependencies\n\nAdd to your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.56\", features = [\"relay\", \"tcp\", \"noise\", \"yamux\"] }\n```\n\n### 2. Setup the Relay Client\n\nThe relay client consists of two main components:\n- **`relay::client::Behaviour`** - The NetworkBehaviour that handles the relay protocol\n- **`relay::client::Transport`** - The transport layer for relayed connections\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay, identity, PeerId, Multiaddr, Swarm,\n    core::transport::OrTransport,\n    tcp, noise, yamux,\n    swarm::NetworkBehaviour,\n};\n\n// Generate a keypair and peer ID\nlet local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();\nlet local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());\n\n// Create the relay client transport and behaviour\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n```\n\n### 3. Combine with a Base Transport\n\nThe relay transport must be combined with an actual transport (like TCP) using `OrTransport`:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::core::transport::MemoryTransport;\n\nlet actual_transport = MemoryTransport::default();\n// Or for TCP:\n// let actual_transport = tcp::tokio::Transport::default();\n\nlet transport = OrTransport::new(relay_transport, actual_transport);\n```\n\n### 4. Dialing Through a Relay\n\nTo dial a destination peer through a relay, construct a **circuit relay address** with the `/p2p-circuit` protocol:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::core::multiaddr::Protocol;\n\nlet relay_id: PeerId = /* relay peer ID */;\nlet destination_id: PeerId = /* destination peer ID */;\n\n// Build the relay address\nlet dst_addr_via_relay = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Memory(40))           // Relay's transport address\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_id))        // Relay peer ID\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)           // Signal to use relay\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_id)); // Destination peer ID\n\n// Dial through the relay\ntransport.dial(dst_addr_via_relay, DialOpts {\n    port_use: PortUse::Reuse,\n    role: Endpoint::Dialer,\n}).unwrap();\n```\n\n### 5. Listening for Incoming Relayed Connections\n\nTo receive connections through a relay:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_addr = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Memory(40))      // Relay address\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_id))   // Relay peer ID  \n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit);     // Signal to listen via relay\n\ntransport.listen_on(ListenerId::next(), relay_addr).unwrap();\n```\n\n### 6. Complete Example with Swarm\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay, identity, PeerId, Multiaddr, Swarm, SwarmBuilder,\n    swarm::NetworkBehaviour,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct MyBehaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    // ... other behaviours\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();\n    let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());\n\n    let mut swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_existing_identity(local_key)\n        .with_tokio()\n        .with_tcp(\n            tcp::Config::default(),\n            noise::Config::new,\n            yamux::Config::default,\n        )\n        .unwrap()\n        .with_relay_client(noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)\n        .unwrap()\n        .with_behaviour(|key, relay_behaviour| MyBehaviour {\n            relay_client: relay_behaviour,\n        })\n        .unwrap()\n        .build();\n\n    // Dial through relay\n    let relay_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse().unwrap();\n    let dest_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse().unwrap();\n    \n    let relayed_addr: Multiaddr = format!(\n        \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/{}/p2p-circuit/p2p/{}\",\n        relay_peer_id, dest_peer_id\n    ).parse().unwrap();\n\n    swarm.dial(relayed_addr).unwrap();\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Address Format**: The relay address format is: `<relay-addr>/p2p/<relay-peer-id>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<destination-peer-id>`\n\n2. **The relay client behaviour** handles the circuit relay v2 protocol negotiation automatically\n\n3. **Use `OrTransport`** to combine relay transport with your base transport (TCP, QUIC, etc.)\n\n4. **For NAT traversal**, consider also using `libp2p-dcutr` (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay) which can upgrade relayed connections to direct connections via hole punching","hint":"A correct answer must describe how to use the current (latest) Rust libp2p relay client components—specifically the `libp2p::relay::client` behaviour and its associated client transport/connection types—to dial a remote peer via a relay, including constructing a `Swarm` with the relay client behaviour, wrapping the base `Transport` with the relay client transport, and dialing a peer using a relayed multiaddr (e.g., including the relay and `/p2p-circuit` segments) rather than a direct address.

Combine with a Base Transport\n\nThe relay transport must be combined with an actual transport (like TCP) using `OrTransport`:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::core::transport::MemoryTransport;\n\nlet actual_transport = MemoryTransport::default();\n// Or for TCP:\n// let actual_transport = tcp::tokio::Transport::default();\n\nlet transport = OrTransport::new(relay_transport, actual_transport);\n```\n\n### 4. Dialing Through a Relay\n\nTo dial a destination peer through a relay, construct a **circuit relay address** with the `/p2p-circuit` protocol:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::core::multiaddr::Protocol;\n\nlet relay_id: PeerId = /* relay peer ID */;\nlet destination_id: PeerId = /* destination peer ID */;\n\n// Build the relay address\nlet dst_addr_via_relay = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Memory(40))           // Relay's transport address\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_id))        // Relay peer ID\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)           // Signal to use relay\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_id)); // Destination peer ID\n\n// Dial through the relay\ntransport.dial(dst_addr_via_relay, DialOpts {\n    port_use: PortUse::Reuse,\n    role: Endpoint::Dialer,\n}).unwrap();\n```\n\n### 5. Listening for Incoming Relayed Connections\n\nTo receive connections through a relay:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_addr = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Memory(40))      // Relay address\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_id))   // Relay peer ID  \n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit);     // Signal to listen via relay\n\ntransport.listen_on(ListenerId::next(), relay_addr).unwrap();\n```\n\n### 6. Complete Example with Swarm\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay, identity, PeerId, Multiaddr, Swarm, SwarmBuilder,\n    swarm::NetworkBehaviour,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct MyBehaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    // ... other behaviours\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();\n    let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());\n\n    let mut swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_existing_identity(local_key)\n        .with_tokio()\n        .with_tcp(\n            tcp::Config::default(),\n            noise::Config::new,\n            yamux::Config::default,\n        )\n        .unwrap()\n        .with_relay_client(noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)\n        .unwrap()\n        .with_behaviour(|key, relay_behaviour| MyBehaviour {\n            relay_client: relay_behaviour,\n        })\n        .unwrap()\n        .build();\n\n    // Dial through relay\n    let relay_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse().unwrap();\n    let dest_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse().unwrap();\n    \n    let relayed_addr: Multiaddr = format!(\n        \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/{}/p2p-circuit/p2p/{}\",\n        relay_peer_id, dest_peer_id\n    ).parse().unwrap();\n\n    swarm.dial(relayed_addr).unwrap();\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Address Format**: The relay address format is: `<relay-addr>/p2p/<relay-peer-id>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<destination-peer-id>`\n\n2. **The relay client behaviour** handles the circuit relay v2 protocol negotiation automatically\n\n3. **Use `OrTransport`** to combine relay transport with your base transport (TCP, QUIC, etc.)\n\n4. **For NAT traversal**, consider also using `libp2p-dcutr` (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay) which can upgrade relayed connections to direct connections via hole punching","timestamp":41088}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Libp2p_Rust","lang":"Rust","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770550941191,"end":1770550982279,"firstResponse":41088,"sessionCreation":0,"total":41088},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Let me provide you with a detailed guide on managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in production for 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Managing Terraform Security Scanning Baseline Exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in Production (2026)\n\n### Important Note: tfsec Migration to Trivy\n\nAs of 2025-2026, **tfsec has been officially merged into Trivy** by Aqua Security. While tfsec remains available, all new development focuses on Trivy. You should consider migrating to Trivy for long-term support. A migration guide is available at: https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/blob/master/tfsec-to-trivy-migration-guide.md\n\n---\n\n## 1. Checkov Baseline Management\n\n### Creating a Baseline File\n\nCheckov provides a robust baseline feature for managing known issues:\n\n```bash\n# Create a baseline file capturing existing findings\ncheckov -d /path/to/terraform --create-baseline\n\n# This creates a .checkov.baseline file in the scanned directory\n```\n\n### Using the Baseline in Subsequent Scans\n\n```bash\n# Run scan using the baseline (only new issues flagged)\ncheckov -d /path/to/terraform --baseline /path/to/.checkov.baseline\n```\n\n### Inline Suppression (Per-Resource Exceptions)\n\nAdd comments directly in Terraform files:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Access logging not required for this use case\n  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_145:Encryption handled at application level\n  bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\nFor multiple resources:\n```hcl\n# checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Approved exception - JIRA-1234\n# checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_6:Legacy bucket, scheduled for deprecation Q2 2026\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"legacy_bucket\" {\n  bucket = \"legacy-data\"\n}\n```\n\n### CLI-Level Skip/Check Options\n\n```bash\n# Skip specific checks globally\ncheckov -d . --skip-check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_145\n\n# Run only specific checks\ncheckov -d . --check CKV_AWS_21,CKV_AWS_19\n\n# Skip entire frameworks\ncheckov -d . --skip-framework dockerfile\n\n# Use external config file\ncheckov -d . --config-file /path/to/.checkov.yaml\n```\n\n### Checkov Configuration File (.checkov.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n# .checkov.yaml\nsoft-fail: false\ncompact: true\nskip-check:\n  - CKV_AWS_18    # S3 access logging - handled externally\n  - CKV_AWS_145   # S3 KMS encryption - using AES256\n  - CKV2_AWS_6    # S3 public access - approved public buckets\ncheck:\n  - CKV_AWS_21    # Ensure versioning is enabled\n  - CKV_AWS_19    # Ensure encryption is enabled\nframework:\n  - terraform\n  - terraform_plan\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. tfsec/Trivy Baseline Management\n\n### Inline Ignores in Terraform\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"example\" {\n  #tfsec:ignore:aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr\n  type        = \"ingress\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n}\n\n# With expiration date (auto-expires on date)\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  #tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging:exp:2026-06-30\n  bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n}\n\n# With workspace scoping\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  #tfsec:ignore:aws-ec2-enforce-http-token-imds:ws:production\n  instance_type = \"t3.micro\"\n}\n```\n\n### Multiple Rules in One Comment\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  #tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging:exp:2026-12-31 tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-versioning\n  bucket = \"temporary-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration File (.tfsec.yaml or tfsec.yml)\n\n```yaml\n# .tfsec.yaml\nseverity_overrides:\n  aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging: LOW\n  aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr: ERROR\n\nexclude:\n  - aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging\n  - aws-s3-specify-public-access-block\n\nminimum_severity: MEDIUM\n\ninclude:\n  - aws-s3-enable-versioning\n  - aws-s3-encryption-customer-key\n```\n\n### Trivy Configuration (for migration)\n\n```yaml\n# trivy.yaml\nseverity:\n  - HIGH\n  - CRITICAL\n\nmisconfiguration:\n  scanners:\n    - terraform\n  \n  # Skip specific checks\n  skip-files:\n    - \"**/legacy/**\"\n  \n  # Terraform-specific settings  \n  terraform:\n    exclude-downloaded-modules: false\n```\n\nRun Trivy with config:\n```bash\ntrivy config --config trivy.yaml /path/to/terraform\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Production Best Practices for 2026\n\n### A. Centralized Exception Management\n\nCreate a dedicated exceptions file:\n\n```yaml\n# security-exceptions.yaml\nexceptions:\n  - id: CKV_AWS_18\n    reason: \"S3 access logging handled by centralized logging solution\"\n    approved_by: \"security-team@company.com\"\n    approved_date: \"2026-01-15\"\n    expiry_date: \"2026-07-15\"\n    jira_ticket: \"SEC-1234\"\n    \n  - id: aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging\n    reason: \"Same as above - tfsec equivalent\"\n    approved_by: \"security-team@company.com\"\n    approved_date: \"2026-01-15\"\n    expiry_date: \"2026-07-15\"\n```\n\n### B. CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions Example)\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/terraform-security.yml\nname: Terraform Security Scan\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - '**.tf'\n      - '**.tfvars'\n\njobs:\n  checkov:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      \n      - name: Run Checkov\n        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@v12\n        with:\n          directory: ./terraform\n          baseline: .checkov.baseline\n          config_file: .checkov.yaml\n          soft_fail: false\n          output_format: sarif\n          \n  trivy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      \n      - name: Run Trivy\n        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master\n        with:\n          scan-type: 'config'\n          scan-ref: './terraform'\n          trivy-config: trivy.yaml\n          severity: 'HIGH,CRITICAL'\n          exit-code: '1'\n```\n\n### C. Exception Governance Workflow\n\n1. **Document all exceptions** with:\n   - Business justification\n   - Compensating controls\n   - Approval from security team\n   - Expiration date\n   - Ticket/tracking reference\n\n2. **Use expiration dates** on inline ignores:\n   ```hcl\n   #tfsec:ignore:aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr:exp:2026-06-30\n   #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Approved until 2026-06-30 - SEC-1234\n   ```\n\n3. **Regular baseline reviews** (quarterly recommended):\n   ```bash\n   # Regenerate baseline and diff\n   checkov -d . --create-baseline --output-file .checkov.baseline.new\n   diff .checkov.baseline .checkov.baseline.new\n   ```\n\n4. **Soft-fail in development, hard-fail in production**:\n   ```yaml\n   # Development\n   checkov -d . --soft-fail\n   \n   # Production CI\n   checkov -d . --hard-fail-on HIGH,CRITICAL\n   ```\n\n### D. Combining Both Tools\n\nRun both tools for comprehensive coverage:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# security-scan.sh\n\nset -e\n\necho \"Running Checkov...\"\ncheckov -d ./terraform \\\n  --baseline .checkov.baseline \\\n  --config-file .checkov.yaml \\\n  --output cli \\\n  --output junitxml > checkov-results.xml\n\necho \"Running Trivy (formerly tfsec)...\"\ntrivy config ./terraform \\\n  --config trivy.yaml \\\n  --severity HIGH,CRITICAL \\\n  --format sarif \\\n  --output trivy-results.sarif\n\necho \"Security scan complete\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Feature | Checkov | tfsec/Trivy |\n|---------|---------|-------------|\n| Baseline file | `--create-baseline` / `--baseline` | Not native (use config) |\n| Inline skip | `# checkov:skip=ID:reason` | `#tfsec:ignore:rule` |\n| Expiration | Manual tracking | `#tfsec:ignore:rule:exp:YYYY-MM-DD` |\n| Config file | `.checkov.yaml` | `.tfsec.yaml` / `trivy.yaml` |\n| Workspace scope | N/A | `#tfsec:ignore:rule:ws:workspace` |\n| CLI skip | `--skip-check ID1,ID2` | `--exclude rule1,rule2` |\n\n**Key recommendations for 2026:**\n1. Migrate from tfsec to Trivy for future-proofing\n2. Use Checkov's baseline feature for managing legacy exceptions\n3. Always include expiration dates and tracking references\n4. Implement quarterly exception reviews\n5. Integrate both tools in CI/CD for comprehensive coverage","hint":"A correct answer must describe concrete practices for managing and documenting baseline/exception handling for Terraform security scans specifically with tfsec and Checkov (e.g., how to mark/track justified suppressions, set expiry/review, and keep the baseline under change control), and explain how these are integrated into a production CI/CD workflow (e.g., enforcement on PRs vs. main, policy-as-code, approvals) to minimize long‑lived risk by 2026.[[1, 2, 3]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","timestamp":64022},{"type":"message","content":"I'll research the current best practices for managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026.","timestamp":64022},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":64022},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GhJCboa7p9QiP5Ykfg73SC","status":"completed","timestamp":64022},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GyTgFwFsvEUTCtFAqJcWce","status":"completed","timestamp":64022},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01J4FqnN3VJDtAz9eCaW1dBX","status":"completed","timestamp":64022},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about baseline files and exception management best practices.","timestamp":64022},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SersRA8ibfj2FD3oR9b63j","status":"completed","timestamp":64022},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NgPcJMdd9UwJA3t6AbVP5T","status":"completed","timestamp":64022},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have comprehensive information.

Combining Both Tools\n\nRun both tools for comprehensive coverage:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# security-scan.sh\n\nset -e\n\necho \"Running Checkov...\"\ncheckov -d ./terraform \\\n  --baseline .checkov.baseline \\\n  --config-file .checkov.yaml \\\n  --output cli \\\n  --output junitxml > checkov-results.xml\n\necho \"Running Trivy (formerly tfsec)...\"\ntrivy config ./terraform \\\n  --config trivy.yaml \\\n  --severity HIGH,CRITICAL \\\n  --format sarif \\\n  --output trivy-results.sarif\n\necho \"Security scan complete\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Feature | Checkov | tfsec/Trivy |\n|---------|---------|-------------|\n| Baseline file | `--create-baseline` / `--baseline` | Not native (use config) |\n| Inline skip | `# checkov:skip=ID:reason` | `#tfsec:ignore:rule` |\n| Expiration | Manual tracking | `#tfsec:ignore:rule:exp:YYYY-MM-DD` |\n| Config file | `.checkov.yaml` | `.tfsec.yaml` / `trivy.yaml` |\n| Workspace scope | N/A | `#tfsec:ignore:rule:ws:workspace` |\n| CLI skip | `--skip-check ID1,ID2` | `--exclude rule1,rule2` |\n\n**Key recommendations for 2026:**\n1. Migrate from tfsec to Trivy for future-proofing\n2. Use Checkov's baseline feature for managing legacy exceptions\n3. Always include expiration dates and tracking references\n4. Implement quarterly exception reviews\n5.
