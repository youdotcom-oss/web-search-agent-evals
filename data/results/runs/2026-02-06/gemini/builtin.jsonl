{"id":"websearch-49","input":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","output":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026\nDeploying a GPT model to Azure\n AI Foundry (which will be known as Microsoft Foundry from January 1, 2026) using Pulumi\n is a robust way to manage your AI infrastructure as code. Here’s a guide on how you can do this in 2\n026.\n\n### Conceptual Overview\n\nThe process involves writing a Pulumi program in a language like TypeScript or Python to define the\n necessary Azure resources. Pulumi then provisions and configures these resources in your Azure subscription.\n\nThe key resources you'll be\n working with are:\n\n1.  **Resource Group:** A logical container for your Azure resources.\n2.  **Azure\n OpenAI Service:** The Azure service that hosts the GPT models.\n3.  **Model Deployment:** The specific GPT model you\n want to deploy (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-5).\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n\n#### 1. Prerequisites\n\n*   An active **Azure subscription**.\n*   The **Pulumi CLI** installed\n.\n*   The **Azure CLI** installed and configured with your credentials (`az login`).\n*   **Node\n.js and npm** (for the TypeScript example).\n\n#### 2. Set Up Your Pulumi Project\n\nFirst\n, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Pulumi project for Azure using TypeScript:\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir azure\n-gpt-deployment && cd azure-gpt-deployment\npulumi new azure-typescript\n\n```\n\n\nFollow the prompts to set\n up the project.\n\n#### 3. Write the Pulumi Program\n\nNext, you'll write the code to\n define your infrastructure. The following TypeScript example demonstrates how to deploy a GPT model. Note that the specific model names and versions\n available in 2026 may be different.\n\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\n\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// Create an Azure Resource Group\nconst resourceGroup =\n new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg-ai-foundry\");\n\n// Create an Azure OpenAI Account\n\nconst openAiAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    \nresourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",\n    sku: {\n        name:\n \"S0\", // Choose a SKU that fits your needs\n    },\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n});\n\n\n// Deploy a GPT Model\nconst modelDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-model\n-deployment\", {\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    accountName: openAiAccount.name\n,\n    deploymentName: \"my-gpt-model\", // A name for your deployment\n    properties: {\n        model\n: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-4\", // The model you want to deploy\n\n            version: \"1106-preview\", // The model version\n        },\n    },\n    sku: {\n\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10, // Define the processing capacity\n    },\n});\n\n//\n Export the endpoint of the OpenAI account\nexport const endpoint = openAiAccount.properties.endpoint;\n\n```\n\n\n#### \n4. Deploy the Infrastructure\n\nTo deploy your GPT model, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n\n```bash\npulumi up\n\n\n```\n\n\nPulumi will show you a preview of the resources to be created. If everything looks correct, confirm the deployment\n to proceed.\n\n### Important Considerations for 2026\n\n*   **Platform Name:** Remember that \"Azure AI Foundry\"\n will be \"Microsoft Foundry\". This may be reflected in the Azure portal and documentation.\n*   **Model Catalog:** In\n 2026, you will have access to a wider range of models, including the GPT-5 series and potentially models\n from other providers. You can specify these in the `name` property of the `model` object in your Pulumi code.\n\n*   **Pulumi Provider:** Always ensure you are using the latest version of the `@pulumi/azure-native` package\n to have access to the latest features and resources available in Azure.\n*   **API Versions:** Be mindful of the API\n versions for the Azure resources you are deploying. These may be updated over time.\n\nBy following this approach, you can\n programmatically manage your GPT model deployments on Microsoft Foundry, making it easier to integrate them into your applications and to maintain your\n infrastructure over time.","hint":"A good answer must outline the end-to-end process of deploying a GPT(-x) Azure OpenAI model into Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi, including: configuring Azure credentials, defining/publishing the Foundry (or Azure OpenAI) resource and model deployment (e.g., GPT-4/5 variant, region, SKU/throughput, endpoint), and wiring Pulumi IaC code (in a supported language) that provisions these resources and exposes the deployment endpoint or connection details for application use in 2026-era Azure AI Foundry.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","timestamp":290352},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":290352},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770375839837-27bef7de46d02","status":"completed","timestamp":290352},{"type":"message","content":"Deploying a GPT model to Azure","timestamp":290352},{"type":"message","content":" AI Foundry (which will be known as Microsoft Foundry from January 1, 2026) using Pulumi","timestamp":290352},{"type":"message","content":" is a robust way to manage your AI infrastructure as code.

{"id":"websearch-2","input":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","output":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?\nBased on the latest trends\n and expert insights for 2026, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and\n pricing tables.\n\n### **Galleries**\n\n#### **Landing Page Strategies for Galleries**\n\n*   **Embrace Im\nmersive Minimalism:** In 2026, the trend is towards calm, clean, and neutral designs that allow the\n artwork to be the main focus. Utilize minimalist color palettes (white, cream, charcoal) and consider \"anti-grid\"\n layouts with organic shapes to create a more natural and sophisticated digital experience.\n*   **Tell a Story:** Go beyond just\n displaying images. Weave a narrative about the artist, the collection, or the gallery's mission to create an emotional connection with visitors\n.\n*   **High-Quality Visuals are Key:** Use high-resolution images and videos of the artwork and\n gallery space. Incorporate interactive elements like virtual gallery tours or 3D models to offer a more immersive experience.\n*   **\nClear Call-to-Action (CTA):** Every landing page should have a single, clear goal, whether it's\n to RSVP to an exhibition, inquire about a piece, or sign up for a newsletter. The CTA should be prominent and use\n action-oriented language.\n*   **Build Trust with Social Proof:** Include testimonials from collectors, press mentions, or\n awards to build credibility and trust with potential visitors and buyers.\n\n#### **Responsive Design Patterns for Galleries**\n\n*   **\nFluid Grid Layouts:** Utilize CSS Grid and Flexbox to create fluid and flexible layouts that adapt to any screen size. This\n ensures that your gallery looks great on everything from a large desktop monitor to a small smartphone.\n*   **Optimized Images\n:** Use responsive images with the `<picture>` element and `srcset` attribute to deliver the appropriately sized image for each user\n's device. This improves loading times and provides a better user experience. Implement lazy loading to defer the loading of off\n-screen images.\n*   **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** With the prevalence of mobile devices, ensure that your gallery is easy\n to navigate with touch gestures. Implement swiping for image carousels and ensure that buttons and other interactive elements are large\n enough to be easily tapped.\n*   **\"Fluid Design\" for Emerging Devices:** Look beyond traditional breakpoints and adopt\n a \"fluid design\" mindset. This means creating layouts that can adapt to a wide range of screen shapes and sizes, including\n those of foldable phones and other emerging devices.\n*   **Maintain Visual Hierarchy:** Ensure that the visual hierarchy of your page\n remains effective on all screen sizes. This may mean adjusting font sizes, spacing, and the layout of elements to ensure that the most\n important information is always front and center.\n\n### **Pricing Tables**\n\n#### **Landing Page Strategies for Pricing Tables**\n\n\n*   **Clarity and Transparency:** Be upfront and clear about your pricing. Avoid hidden fees and use simple, easy-to\n-understand language to describe your plans and features.\n*   **Visual Hierarchy to Guide Choice:** Use visual cues like color\n, size, or a \"Most Popular\" badge to highlight a specific plan and guide users towards the best option for them.\n\n*   **Interactive Elements:** Incorporate interactive elements like a toggle for monthly vs. annual pricing or a slider for usage\n-based plans. This allows users to see the direct impact of their choices on the price.\n*   **Strong,\n Clear CTAs:** Each plan should have a clear and compelling CTA. Use action-oriented language like \"Get Started\" or \"\nSign Up Now.\"\n*   **Social Proof and Trust Signals:** Include testimonials, case studies, or logos of well-\nknown customers to build trust and credibility.\n\n#### **Responsive Design Patterns for Pricing Tables**\n\n*   **Vertical St\nacking on Mobile:** On smaller screens, pricing tables should stack vertically to be easily readable and comparable. Avoid horizontal scrolling, which\n can be frustrating for users.\n*   **Accordions for Feature Lists:** To save space on mobile devices, use accordions\n to display the full list of features for each plan. This allows users to easily compare the features that are most important to\n them without being overwhelmed.\n*   **Sticky CTAs:** On long pricing pages, consider making the CTAs \"\nsticky\" so that they remain visible as the user scrolls. This makes it easy for them to take action at any point\n.\n*   **Guided Choice with Selectors:** For complex pricing structures, consider adding a simple needs selector or a\n short questionnaire to help users find the right plan for them.\n*   **Design for Emerging Devices:** As with galleries\n, it's important to consider how your pricing tables will look on a variety of devices, including foldable phones. This may require\n creating more flexible and adaptive layouts.","hint":"A correct answer must describe current (2026) high-converting landing page principles (clear value proposition and CTA, scannable layouts, social proof, mobile-first performance and responsiveness) and apply them specifically to galleries and pricing tables by mentioning modern responsive patterns (e.g., card- or grid-based galleries, carousels, masonry or modular layouts; stacked, accordion, or comparison-table pricing that reflows on small screens), along with UX details like visual hierarchy, clarity, and accessibility considerations for different devices.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","timestamp":306826},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":306826},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770375832463-932724b7de418","status":"completed","timestamp":306826},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770375832466-681cdd6364a288","status":"completed","timestamp":306826},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770375832466-a89bfaa740fde8","status":"completed","timestamp":306826},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770375832467-d0cb3c2098f718","status":"completed","timestamp":306826},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest trends","timestamp":306827},{"type":"message","content":" and expert insights for 2026, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and","timestamp":306827},{"type":"message","content":" pricing tables.\n\n### **Galleries**\n\n#### **Landing Page Strategies for Galleries**\n\n*   **Embrace Im","timestamp":306827},{"type":"message","content":"mersive Minimalism:** In 2026, the trend is towards calm, clean, and neutral designs that allow the","timestamp":306827},{"type":"message","content":" artwork to be the main focus.

This script automatically manages UFW rules for you, allowing you to use standard `ufw` commands to\n manage Docker container ports.\n\nHere's how to set it up:\n\n1.  **Download the script:**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com\n/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\n    \n```\n\n2.  **\nMake the script executable:**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\n\n    \n```\n\n3.  **Install the UFW rules:**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo ufw-docker install\n\n    \n```\n\n4.  **Reload UFW and Docker:**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo ufw reload\n\n    sudo systemctl restart docker\n    \n```\n\n\nAfter installation, you can expose a container's port and manage\n it with `ufw` as you normally would:\n\n\n```bash\n# Expose a port when running a container\ndocker\n run -p 8080:80 nginx\n\n# Allow traffic to that port using ufw\nsudo u\nfw allow 8080\n\n```\n\n\n### Alternative Solution: Manual UFW Configuration\n\nIf you prefer not to use a\n third-party script, you can manually configure UFW to manage Docker's traffic.

{"id":"websearch-557","input":"What are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","output":"What are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?\nFor handling optional array parameters in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026, the best practice is to use a\n `JSONB` parameter in your PostgreSQL function. This approach offers the most flexibility for handling complex or evolving pricing override structures\n. For simpler cases, using a `DEFAULT` value for an array parameter is also a viable option.\n\nHere’\ns a breakdown of the best practices:\n\n### 1. Use `JSONB` for Maximum Flexibility (Recommended)\n\nThis\n method is ideal for complex scenarios where you might have multiple override conditions or structured data within the array.\n\n**PostgreSQL Function\n Example:**\n\nCreate a function that accepts a `JSONB` object. This object can contain an array of pricing overrides.\n\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_final_price(\n  product_id_in uuid,\n  over\nrides JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::JSONB\n)\nRETURNS NUMERIC\nLANGUAGE plpgsql\nAS $$\nDECLARE\n\n  base_price NUMERIC;\n  final_price NUMERIC;\n  override_rule JSONB;\n  \noverride_price NUMERIC;\nBEGIN\n  -- Get the base price of the product\n  SELECT price INTO base_price FROM\n products WHERE id = product_id_in;\n  final_price := base_price;\n\n  -- Loop\n through the overrides array if it exists\n  IF jsonb_typeof(overrides) = 'array' AND jsonb_array\n_length(overrides) > 0 THEN\n    FOR override_rule IN SELECT * FROM jsonb_array_elements\n(overrides)\n    LOOP\n      -- Example override logic: apply if product_id matches\n      IF override_\nrule->>'product_id' = product_id_in::text THEN\n        override_price := (override_rule->\n>'price')::NUMERIC;\n        IF override_price IS NOT NULL AND override_price < final_price THEN\n\n          final_price := override_price;\n        END IF;\n      END IF;\n    END LOOP\n;\n  END IF;\n\n  RETURN final_price;\nEND;\n$$;\n\n```\n\n\n**Client\n-Side Call (JavaScript):**\n\nYou can then call this RPC from your application, passing the array of overrides.\n\n\n\n```javascript\n// With pricing overrides\nconst withOverrides = await supabase.rpc('get_final_price', {\n  \nproduct_id_in: 'your-product-id',\n  overrides: [\n    { product_id: '\nyour-product-id', price: 99.99 },\n    { user_group: 'wholesale\n', price: 89.99 } // Example of more complex rule\n  ]\n});\n\n// Without pricing\n overrides\nconst withoutOverrides = await supabase.rpc('get_final_price', {\n  product_id_in:\n 'your-product-id'\n  // 'overrides' parameter is omitted and will use the default value\n});\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Use `DEFAULT` for Simpler Scenarios\n\nIf your pricing overrides are a simple array of values\n (e.g., a list of discount codes), you can use a `DEFAULT` value.\n\n**PostgreSQL Function Example\n:**\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_price_with_discounts(\n  product_id_\nin uuid,\n  discount_codes TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::TEXT[]\n)\nRETURNS NUMERIC\nLANGUAGE\n plpgsql\nAS $$\nDECLARE\n  base_price NUMERIC;\n  final_price NUMERIC;\n  \ndiscount_value NUMERIC;\nBEGIN\n  SELECT price INTO base_price FROM products WHERE id = product_id\n_in;\n  final_price := base_price;\n\n  -- Apply discounts if any codes are provided\n\n  IF array_length(discount_codes, 1) > 0 THEN\n    SELECT COALESCE(SUM\n(value), 0)\n    INTO discount_value\n    FROM discounts\n    WHERE code = ANY(discount_\ncodes);\n\n    final_price := final_price - discount_value;\n  END IF;\n\n  RETURN\n CASE WHEN final_price > 0 THEN final_price ELSE 0 END;\nEND;\n$$;\n\n```\n\n\n**Client-Side Call (JavaScript):**\n\n\n```javascript\n// With discount codes\nconst withDiscounts = await supabase.\nrpc('get_price_with_discounts', {\n  product_id_in: 'your-product\n-id',\n  discount_codes: ['SUMMER20', 'NEWUSER']\n});\n\n// Without discount codes\n\nconst withoutDiscounts = await supabase.rpc('get_price_with_discounts', {\n  product_\nid_in: 'your-product-id'\n});\n\n```\n\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n*   **\nExtensibility:** The `JSONB` approach is more extensible. If you need to add more complex override rules in the future (\ne.g., based on user roles, quantity), you can easily add new keys to the JSON objects without changing the function\n signature.\n*   **Type Safety:** When using `JSONB`, you are responsible for validating the structure and types of\n the data within your PostgreSQL function.\n*   **Performance:** For very large arrays of overrides, you should be mindful of the\n performance of your function. Ensure you have appropriate indexes on the tables you are querying.","hint":"A correct answer should explain how to define the underlying PostgreSQL function used by Supabase RPC so that the array parameter is truly optional (e.g., with a default of NULL or an empty array and server-side logic that distinguishes “no overrides” from “apply these overrides”), and how to pass/omit that array from the Supabase client SDK in a type-safe way (e.g., typed array/JSONB, named parameters) without breaking existing calls.[[1]] It should also mention handling edge cases like empty arrays vs missing parameters, ensuring backwards compatibility for existing clients, and validating the override data before applying pricing logic.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","timestamp":59694},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":59694},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770376707237-9e81bab7b69c5","status":"completed","timestamp":59694},{"type":"message","content":"For handling optional array parameters in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026, the best practice is to use a","timestamp":59694},{"type":"message","content":" `JSONB` parameter in your PostgreSQL function.

Here's\n a guide on how you can achieve this, based on the latest functionalities available.\n\n### 1. Project Setup and Prerequisites\n\n\nFirst, ensure your development environment is ready:\n\n*   **Node.js 18+**\n*   **\nA package manager** like `pnpm` or `npm`\n*   **Vercel AI Gateway API Key**:\n You can get this from your Vercel account.\n\nNext, set up your Next.js application:\n\n\n```bash\n\npnpm create next-app@latest my-multimodal-app\ncd my-multimodal-app\np\nnpm install ai @ai-sdk/react\n\n```\n\n\nCreate a `.env.local` file in your project's root and\n add your Vercel AI Gateway API key:\n\n\n```\nVercel_AI_Gateway_API_Key=\nyour_api_key_here\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Create the API Route Handler\n\nYou'll need\n an API route to handle the multimodal input. Create a file at `app/api/chat/route.ts`:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText, convertToCoreMessages } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/\nopenai';\n\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  \nconst { messages } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = await streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt\n-4o'), // Or any other multimodal model provider\n    messages: convertToCoreMessages(messages),\n  \n});\n\n  return result.toAIStreamResponse();\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Build the Frontend\n\nNow, let\n's create a chat interface that accepts both text and images. You can modify your `app/page.tsx` file:\n\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { useChat } from 'ai/react';\nimport { useState } from '\nreact';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const [imageFile, setImageFile] = useState<File | null>(\nnull);\n  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, append } = useChat({\n    api: '/\napi/chat',\n  });\n\n  const handleFileChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)\n => {\n    if (event.target.files?.[0]) {\n      setImageFile(event.target\n.files[0]);\n    }\n  };\n\n  const handleMultimodalSubmit = (e: React.Form\nEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    if (imageFile) {\n      const\n reader = new FileReader();\n      reader.onloadend = () => {\n        const base64Image = reader.result as\n string;\n        append({\n          role: 'user',\n          content: [\n            { type: 'text',\n text: input },\n            { type: 'image', image: base64Image },\n          ],\n        \n});\n      };\n      reader.readAsDataURL(imageFile);\n    } else {\n      handleSubmit(e\n);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        {messages.map(\nm => (\n          <div key={m.id}>\n            <strong>{m.role === 'user' ?\n 'User: ' : 'AI: '}</strong>\n            {/* ... render message content, including images ... */}\n          </div>\n\n        ))}\n      </div>\n\n      <form onSubmit={handleMultimodalSubmit}>\n        <input\n          value={input}\n\n          placeholder=\"What's on your mind?\"\n          onChange={handleInputChange}\n        />\n        <input\n\n          type=\"file\"\n          accept=\"image/*\"\n          onChange={handleFileChange}\n        />\n\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\nThis guide provides a foundational implementation for multimodal content with the Vercel AI SDK.

Here are the steps to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing\n on your blog posts in Google Search Console for 2024.\n\n### 1. Implement Video Structured Data\n (Schema Markup)\nGoogle relies on structured data to understand and index video content. The most important schema for videos is `Video\nObject`.\n\n*   **Add `VideoObject` Schema:** Add `VideoObject` schema markup to the page where the\n video is embedded. This helps Google understand the video's metadata, including its title, description, thumbnail URL, and\n duration.\n*   **Validate Your Schema:** Use Google's [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com\n/test/rich-results) to ensure your `VideoObject` structured data is correctly implemented.\n\n### 2\n. Create and Submit a Video Sitemap\nA video sitemap is the most reliable way to tell Google about all the videos on your\n site, making it easier for them to be discovered and indexed.\n\n*   **Generate a Video Sitemap:** Create a separate\n video sitemap or add video sitemap tags to your existing sitemap.\n*   **Submit to Google Search Console:** Submit\n your video sitemap to Google Search Console under the \"Sitemaps\" section.\n\n### 3. On-Page Optimization\n\nThe page where the video is embedded needs to be optimized for both users and search engines.\n\n*   **Video Prominence:** The\n video should be a main focus of the page, not hidden or considered supplementary content. Place the video in a prominent position\n, ideally \"above the fold\" (visible without scrolling).\n*   **Page Indexing:** Ensure the page hosting\n the video is indexed by Google. You can use the URL Inspection Tool in Google Search Console to check its status.\n*   \n**Check `robots.txt` and Meta Tags:** Make sure the page is not disallowed for crawling in your `robots.\ntxt` file and doesn't have a `noindex` meta tag.\n\n### 4. Monitor in Google Search Console\n\nAfter you've implemented the changes, you need to monitor your site in Google Search Console to see the impact.\n\n*   **\nURL Inspection Tool:** Use the URL Inspection Tool to request re-indexing of the page after making changes.\n*   \n**Video Pages Report:** Check the \"Video pages\" report in Google Search Console for any errors and address them.\n\nBy following\n these steps, you can significantly improve the chances of your embedded YouTube videos being properly indexed in Google Search.","hint":"A good answer must explain common reasons embedded YouTube videos aren’t indexed on blog posts (e.g., not considered a “video watch page,” video outside viewport/not prominent, JavaScript/lazy-load or faulty embed preventing detection) and outline concrete 2024-specific fixes aligned with Google’s video indexing guidelines, such as making the page a proper watch page, ensuring a standard iframe/embed visible on initial load on all devices, adding VideoObject structured data and/or video sitemaps, and using Search Console’s Video Indexing and URL Inspection reports to diagnose and verify indexing.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","timestamp":50611},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":50611},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770376762944-03833932045d1","status":"completed","timestamp":50611},{"type":"message","content":"Of course, I can help you with that.

{"id":"websearch-738","input":"How to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026","output":"How to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026\nUsing\n KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026 involves leveraging libraries that use\n KSP under the hood to automate the creation of type-safe accessors for your localized resources. Instead of using KSP directly,\n you'll typically integrate a dedicated i18n library into your project.\n\nHere are some of the most popular and effective\n libraries for this purpose:\n\n### 1. MokoResources\n**moko-resources** is a popular choice\n for multiplatform projects. It simplifies the management of resources, including strings, plurals, images, fonts, and colors\n.\n\n**Key Features:**\n*   **Unified Resource Management:** Define your strings in a single `strings.xml` file\n within the `commonMain` source set.\n*   **Type-Safe Accessors:** The library generates a `StringResource\n` object with properties for each of your strings, providing compile-time safety.\n*   **Platform Integration:** It seamlessly\n integrates with the native Android and iOS resource systems.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1.  Add the `moko-\nresources` Gradle plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`.\n2.  Create your `strings.xml\n` (and other resource files) in `commonMain/resources/MR`.\n3.  The plugin will automatically generate the\n necessary code to access these resources from your common Kotlin code.\n\n### 2. i18n4k\n**\ni18n4k** is a lightweight and powerful library specifically designed for i18n in Kotlin Multiplatform.\n\n\n**Key Features:**\n*   **Simple Setup:** Uses Java `.properties` files for translations.\n*   **Code Generation:**\n Generates a `LocalizedStrings` class with functions for each string, supporting arguments and plurals.\n*   **Cross-\nPlatform:** Supports JVM, JavaScript, and Native targets.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1.  Apply the `i1\n8n4k` Gradle plugin.\n2.  Create `.properties` files for each language (e.g., `strings\n_en.properties`, `strings_de.properties`) in your `commonMain/resources/i18n\n`.\n3.  The plugin generates code that allows you to access your strings in a type-safe manner.\n\n###\n 3. kotlinx-gettext\nFor those who prefer the Gettext workflow, **kotlinx-gettext** is an\n excellent option.\n\n**Key Features:**\n*   **Gettext Integration:** Works directly with `.po` and `.mo\n` files.\n*   **String Extraction:** Includes a Gradle plugin that can extract strings from your source code into a\n `.pot` file.\n*   **Pluralization Support:** Provides robust support for pluralization rules.\n\n**Workflow\n:**\n1.  Add the `kotlinx-gettext` plugin to your build script.\n2.  The\n plugin will extract strings marked for translation from your code.\n3.  Translate the strings in the generated `.po` files\n.\n4.  The library allows you to load the appropriate translations at runtime.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn 202\n6, the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem is mature, and you don't need to write your own KSP processors for i18\nn.

{"id":"websearch-842","input":"What are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","output":"What are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?\nBy 2026, the most effective prompt engineering techniques for\n bounding box detection in medical imaging with Vertex AI, especially using advanced multimodal models, will focus on providing clear, context-rich,\n and structured information to the AI. Here are the best practices:\n\n### 1. Be Explicit and Highly Specific with\n Instructions\n- **Clearly Define the Task**: State that the objective is \"bounding box detection\" for specific pathologies or anatomical structures\n.\n- **Specify Target Objects**: Enumerate the exact objects to be detected (e.g., \"detect all instances\n of lung nodules,\" \"identify and bound liver lesions\").\n- **Detail Output Format**: Specify the precise output format for\n the bounding boxes. Using a structured format like JSON is highly recommended.\n  - *Example*: `[{\"label\n\": \"lung_nodule\", \"box\": [x1, y1, x2, y2]}, {\"label\": \"\nlung_nodule\", \"box\": [x1, y1, x2, y2]}]`\n\n\n### 2. Provide Comprehensive Clinical Context\n- **Patient Information**: Include relevant, anonymized patient data such as age, gender\n, medical history, and symptoms to aid in detection.\n- **Imaging Modality and Plane**: Clearly state the imaging\n modality (e.g., CT, MRI, X-ray) and the specific plane or view (e.g., axial,\n sagittal, coronal).\n- **Clinical Question/Purpose**: Frame the detection task within a clinical question to give the model a deeper\n understanding of the diagnostic goal.\n  - *Example*: \"Given a 65-year-old male patient's axial\n CT scan of the abdomen, identify and provide bounding boxes for any suspected pancreatic masses, considering a history of unexplained weight loss.\"\n\n\n### 3. Leverage Few-Shot Prompting with Examples\n- **Demonstrate Desired Output**: Provide examples of medical\n images paired with their correct bounding box annotations in the specified format. This is particularly effective for less common pathologies or when a\n specific output format is required.\n- **Include Negative Examples**: Show examples where no bounding boxes should be detected to improve\n the model's ability to discriminate.\n\n### 4. Utilize Multimodal Inputs and Visual Prompts\n- **\nCombine Text and Image**: Use Vertex AI's multimodal capabilities to provide both the medical image and a detailed text prompt.\n-\n **Incorporate Visual Markers**: To guide the model's attention to a specific area within an image, use visual prompts\n like circles, arrows, or even preliminary bounding boxes drawn directly onto the image. This is especially helpful for small or subtle\n abnormalities.\n  - *Example*: \"Examine the provided X-ray image.

Embrace Edge-to-Edge Design\nModern Android applications should be designed to display\n content edge-to-edge, utilizing the entire screen. This means the app should draw behind the system bars (status and\n navigation bars).\n\n*   **Implementation**: Use `WindowCompat.enableEdgeToEdge(window)` to enable edge-to\n-edge display. This is the recommended approach for both Compose and Views and is backward-compatible.\n\n### 2.\n Handle System Window Insets\nSystem window insets are the areas of the screen that are partially or fully obscured by system UI components\n. It is crucial to handle these insets to prevent UI elements from being hidden.\n\n*   **`WindowInsets\nCompat`**: Use this AndroidX API to query and react to different types of insets in a way that is consistent across\n various Android versions.\n*   **Apply Padding**: While the app's background should extend to the edges of the screen, critical\n UI elements such as buttons and text should be padded to avoid overlapping with system bars or gesture areas.\n*   **Specific\n Insets to Consider**:\n    *   **Navigation Bar Insets**: Account for the height of the gesture navigation bar at the bottom\n of the screen to ensure that interactive elements are reachable.\n    *   **Status Bar Insets**: Add padding to the top\n of the screen to avoid content overlapping with the status bar and display cutouts (notches).\n    *   **\nDisplay Cutout Insets**: Use `WindowInsets.getDisplayCutout()` to get information about screen cutouts and adjust\n your UI accordingly.\n    *   **Input Method Editor (IME) Insets**: Ensure that your UI adapts when\n the on-screen keyboard is visible to prevent input fields from being hidden.\n\n### 3. Respect Gesture Navigation Areas\nAndroid\n's gesture navigation relies on swipes from the edges of the screen. Your app should not interfere with these system-level gestures.\n\n\n*   **Back Gesture**: Swiping from the left or right edge of the screen triggers the \"back\" action. Avoid placing custom\n swipeable elements in these areas.\n*   **Home and Recent Apps Gestures**: Swiping up from the bottom of the screen\n is used for the \"home\" and \"recent apps\" gestures.\n*   **Gesture Sensitivity**: Be aware that\n users can adjust the sensitivity of the back gesture in the system settings.\n\n### 4. Provide Clear Feedback and Alternatives\n\n*   **Feedback**: Use visual and haptic feedback to confirm that a gesture has been recognized.\n*   \n**Accessibility**: Consider providing alternative ways to perform critical actions, such as on-screen buttons, to improve accessibility.\n\n###\n 5. Ensure Backward Compatibility\nFor devices running Android 10 (API level 29) and earlier, consuming\n insets with `WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED` might prevent insets from being dispatched to sibling views.

The role of human managers is also evolving, shifting towards strategic oversight and enabling AI-\ndriven workflows.\n\n### Key Trends in AI Agent Coordination:\n\n*   **Rise of Multi-Agent Systems:** \n2025 is seeing a significant shift from single-agent applications to multi-agent systems that can collaborate, adapt, and execute\n complex, high-impact challenges. These systems are designed to tackle tasks requiring multiple business disciplines, such as building sales or marketing campaigns.\n Multi-agent AI systems are proving more efficient and scalable, with reported average productivity gains of 35% and significant\n reductions in manual decision-making tasks. They excel at decomposing complex tasks into manageable components, with different agents specializing in information\n retrieval, data analysis, recommendation generation, and output validation, all working in parallel.\n*   **Advanced Orchestration\n and Protocols:** The coordination of these multi-agent systems is becoming increasingly sophisticated. \"Orchestrator uber-models\"\n are emerging to manage overall project workflows, coordinating multiple AI agents and machine learning models. This involves meta-agent coordination,\n overseeing task delegation across specialized agents. The development of robust AI agent protocols is crucial for seamless communication and collaboration between agents, even across\n different machines and security boundaries.\n*   **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** This\n trend introduces reasoning layers and multi-agent orchestration to enhance contextual understanding and response accuracy in how AI agents handle real-time data\n. Agentic RAG allows AI systems to reason over dynamic data sources, making it ideal for fields like legal tech, financial analysis\n, and real-time decision-making.\n*   **Specialization of AI Agents:** AI agents are becoming increasingly specialized,\n taking on initiative-based roles in areas like project coordination, customer support, and strategic decision-making. This specialization allows\n for greater precision and effectiveness within their designated functions.\n\n### Trends in Hierarchical Team Management (Human-AI Collaboration):\n\n\n*   **Human-AI Coexistence and Augmentation:** A principal trend in 2025 is the engineering of systems where\n human agents and AI coexist and collaborate. AI agents are designed to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them, handling analytical or\n repetitive processes and freeing humans for creative and strategic thinking.

There\n's a growing need for managers to possess digital fluency, understanding AI-enabled workflows and leading teams through digital change.\n*   \n**\"Agent-in-Chief\" and Human Control:** With AI agents taking on more autonomous roles, there's a recognized\n need for \"chief-of-staff agents\" or human oversight to manage complex networks of AI systems and ensure human control. This\n emphasizes the importance of maintaining human accountability and decision-making, especially in high-stakes scenarios.\n*   **Focus on AI Governance\n and Ethical Considerations:** As AI agents gain more autonomy, ensuring secure data handling, transparency, and accountability becomes critical. Organizations\n are prioritizing robust AI governance frameworks to monitor performance, ensure compliance, and manage risks like accidental data leakage or deletion.\n*   \n**Upskilling and Reskilling:** Companies are investing in upskilling employees to work effectively alongside AI, recognizing that successful\n AI integration requires a workforce capable of leveraging these new tools.\n\nIn essence, 2025 is a pivotal year where\n AI agents are moving beyond isolated tasks to form coordinated, intelligent teams.

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"How to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","output":"How to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?\nLangGraph enables powerful human-in-the-loop workflows\n by allowing you to interrupt and resume graph execution. This is particularly useful for tasks that require human supervision, validation, or input\n during a multi-step process. Here’s how to use LangGraph's human interrupt and resume features with `Human\nInterrupt` and the `Command` object in Python.\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n1.  **`interrupt()` Function**:\n To pause a graph's execution at a specific point, you call the `interrupt()` function from within one of your graph'\ns nodes. This function can optionally take a JSON-serializable value that will be passed to the caller when the graph\n is interrupted.\n\n2.  **Checkpointer**: To enable interruption, your graph must be configured with a checkpointer. The\n checkpointer is responsible for saving the state of the graph when it's interrupted, so it can be resumed later from\n the same point.\n\n3.  **`thread_id`**: When running a graph that you intend to interrupt\n and resume, you need to provide a unique `thread_id` in the configuration. This ID allows the checkpointer to correctly\n load the saved state for a specific execution thread.\n\n4.  **`Command(resume=value)`**: To\n resume a paused graph, you re-invoke it with the same `thread_id` and pass a `Command\n` object to the `resume` parameter. The value passed to `Command(resume=...)` will be returned by the `interrupt\n()` call in your node, allowing the graph to continue execution.\n\n### Python Example\n\nHere is a practical example of how to\n implement human interrupt and resume in a LangGraph workflow:\n\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import Graph\nfrom langgraph.\ncheckpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\nfrom langgraph.interrupt import interrupt, HumanInterrupt\nfrom langgraph.graph\n.message import add_messages\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage\n\n# 1. Define the\n graph state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n\n# 2.\n Define the graph nodes\ndef agent_node(state: State):\n    print(\"Agent node execution started.\")\n    # This\n is where your agent would do some work.\n    # For this example, we'll just add a message.\n\n    state['messages'] += [AIMessage(content=\"I need human input.\")]\n\n    # Interrupt the graph to\n get human input\n    try:\n        interrupt()\n    except HumanInterrupt as e:\n        # The graph\n will be interrupted here and wait for resume\n        print(f\"Graph interrupted. Waiting for human input.\")\n        # When\n resumed, the value from Command(resume=...) will be returned\n        # and we can add it to the state\n.\n        state['messages'] += [HumanMessage(content=e.resume_value)]\n        print(\"Graph\n resumed with human input.\")\n\n    return {\"messages\": state[\"messages\"]}\n\ndef final_node(state: State):\n\n    print(\"Final node execution started.\")\n    print(\"Final state:\", state)\n    return {\"messages\": state[\"\nmessages\"]}\n\n# 3. Build the graph\nbuilder = Graph()\nbuilder.add_node(\"agent\",\n agent_node)\nbuilder.add_node(\"final\", final_node)\nbuilder.set_entry_point\n(\"agent\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"agent\", \"final\")\nmemory = SqliteSaver.from_conn\n_string(\":memory:\")\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n\n# 4. Run the graph\n and handle the interruption\nthread_id = \"my-thread-1\"\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_\nid\": thread_id}}\n\nprint(\"Starting graph execution...\")\nfor chunk in graph.stream(\n    {\"messages\":\n [HumanMessage(content=\"Start the process.\")]},\n    config=config\n):\n    print(chunk)\n\nprint(\"\\\nnGraph is interrupted. Provide input to resume.\")\nhuman_input = \"Here is my input to continue.\"\n\n\n# 5. Resume the graph\nprint(f\"\\nResuming graph with input: '{human_input}'\n\")\nfor chunk in graph.stream(\n    None,  # Pass None as input when resuming\n    config={\"\nconfigurable\": {\"thread_id\": thread_id, \"resume\": Command(resume=human_input)}}\n):\n    print\n(chunk)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1.  **State Definition**: We define a simple state\n for our graph that contains a list of messages.\n\n2.  **`agent_node`**: This node simulates\n an agent that requires human input.\n    *   It first adds a message to the state and then calls `interrupt\n()`.\n    *   The `interrupt()` call is wrapped in a `try...except HumanInterrupt` block. When\n the graph is interrupted, it will raise a `HumanInterrupt` exception.\n    *   When the graph is resumed\n, the value passed to `Command(resume=...)` will be available in the `resume_value` attribute of the exception object\n. We then add this value as a `HumanMessage` to our state.\n\n3.  **Graph Building**: We build\n a simple graph with the `agent_node` as the entry point, which then proceeds to the `final_node`. A\n `SqliteSaver` is used as the checkpointer.\n\n4.  **Initial Graph Execution**:\n    *   We\n define a unique `thread_id` for this execution.\n    *   We run the graph using `graph.stream()`.\n The graph will execute the `agent_node`, print the initial messages, and then interrupt.\n\n5.  **\nResuming the Graph**:\n    *   After the graph is interrupted, we get some human input.\n    *   \nWe then call `graph.stream()` again with the same `thread_id`.\n    *   This time, we pass\n a `Command(resume=human_input)` to the `resume` key in the configuration. This tells LangGraph to resume the\n specified thread with the provided input.\n    *   The `agent_node` will then continue its execution from the\n point of interruption, using the human input to update the state.\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n*   **Node Restart**: When a graph\n is resumed, the node where the interruption occurred is re-run from the beginning. This is important to keep in mind,\n as any code before the `interrupt()` call in that node will be executed again.\n*   **Human-in-the-\nLoop (HITL) Patterns**: This interruption mechanism is the foundation for building sophisticated HITL workflows, such as:\n    *   \n**Tool Use Validation**: Have a human approve, edit, or reject tool calls before they are executed.\n    *\n   **LLM Output Review**: Allow a human to review and correct the output of a language model before it is used\n in the next step of a process.\n    *   **Providing Additional Context**: Let a human provide missing information or clarification\n in a multi-turn conversation.","hint":"A good answer must explain that in LangGraph Python you trigger a human pause inside a node with `interrupt()` (or corresponding HumanInterrupt types), which requires a checkpointer, and then resume by re‑invoking the graph with a `Command` object whose `resume` field supplies the human’s response back into the node (possibly using the same `thread_id`/config so the saved state is restored).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","timestamp":39199},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":39199},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770376925915-8d93201b782238","status":"completed","timestamp":39199},{"type":"message","content":"LangGraph enables powerful human-in-the-loop workflows","timestamp":39199},{"type":"message","content":" by allowing you to interrupt and resume graph execution.

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"how to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"how to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026\nPyTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock\n when using multiprocessing due to the way Python handles the creation of new processes. The most common cause of this issue is the\n use of the `fork` start method for multiprocessing, which is the default on Linux and macOS.\n\nTo fix this, you should\n explicitly set the multiprocessing start method to `spawn` or `forkserver`.

Create `docker-compose.yml`\n\n\nCreate a file named `docker-compose.yml` in the `guacamole-setup` directory and paste the following\n content into it. Remember to replace `your-secure-password` with a strong password.\n\n\n```yaml\nversion\n: '3.8'\n\nservices:\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres:16-alpine\n    container\n_name: guacamole-postgres\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES\n_USER: guacamole_user\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-secure-password\n      PGDATA: /\nvar/lib/postgresql/data/guacamole\n    volumes:\n      - ./data:/var/lib/\npostgresql/data/guacamole\n      - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d\n    restart\n: unless-stopped\n\n  guacd:\n    image: guacamole/guacd:latest\n    container_name: guacamole-\nguacd\n    restart: unless-stopped\n\n  guacamole:\n    image: guacamole/guacamole:latest\n    container\n_name: guacamole-app\n    environment:\n      GUACD_HOSTNAME: guacd\n      POSTGRES_HOSTNAME\n: postgres\n      POSTGRES_DATABASE: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES_USER: guacamole_user\n\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-secure-password\n    ports:\n      - \"808\n0:8080\"\n    depends_on:\n      - guacd\n      - postgres\n    restart\n: unless-stopped\n\n```\n\n\n### 3.

The key principles are:\n\n*   **Lowercase:** Package names should always\n be in lowercase.\n*   **Single Word:** Use a single, concise word for a package name whenever possible (\ne.g., `json`, `http`, `crypto`).\n*   **No Underscores or Mixed-\nCase:** Do not use underscores (`_`) or mixed-case (e.g., `myPackage` or \n`my_package`). If a package name needs to be composed of multiple words, they should be concatenated (e.g.,\n `tabwriter`).\n*   **Concise and Descriptive:** The name should be short and give a clear indication of what the package\n provides.\n*   **Match Directory Name:** The package name must be the same as the name of the directory that contains the\n package's `.go` files.\n*   **Avoid Common Variable Names:** Do not use package names that are likely to\n conflict with commonly used local variable names (e.g., `buf`, `ctx`).\n*   **`main\n` Package:** For executable commands, the package name must be `main`.\n\n### File Naming and Package Naming\n\n\nNo, a file does not need to have the same name as its package. Here's the distinction:\n\n*   \n**Package Declaration:** A package is defined by the `package` declaration at the top of a `.go` file. All `.\ngo` files within the same directory must have the same package declaration.\n*   **File Naming:** The names\n of the `.go` files themselves are not required to match the package name. It is common practice to give files descriptive\n names that indicate their content. For example, a package named `net/http` might contain files like `client.go`,\n `server.go`, and `transport.go`.

{"id":"websearch-1029","input":"How do I test chrome extension permission warning updates locally by packing the extension in 2026?","output":"How do I test chrome extension permission warning updates locally by packing the extension in 2026?\nTesting\n Chrome extension permission warning updates locally involves a multi-step process of packing your extension, installing\n it, updating the permissions in your manifest, and then repacking and reinstalling it. Here's how you can do this\n in 2026, based on the current and established methods for Chrome extension development:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare\n Your Extension for Packing\n\n1.  **Finalize Your Code:** Ensure that the version of your extension you want to initially\n pack is complete.\n2.  **Update `manifest.json`:**  Before you pack your extension for the first time,\n make sure your `manifest.json` file is configured with the initial set of permissions you want to test. For example:\n\n\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"name\": \"My Awesome Extension\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0\",\n\n      \"manifest_version\": 3,\n      \"permissions\": [\n        \"storage\",\n        \"\nactiveTab\"\n      ]\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 2: Pack Your Extension for the First Time\n\n\n1.  **Open the Extensions Page:** In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`.\n2.  **Enable Developer\n Mode:**  If it's not already enabled, toggle on \"Developer mode\" in the top-right corner.\n\n3.  **Pack Extension:** Click the \"Pack extension\" button.\n4.  **Select Extension Root Directory:** In the\n dialog box that appears, for the \"Extension root directory\" field, browse and select the folder that contains your extension's files\n (including the `manifest.json`).\n5.  **Private Key File (First Time):** Leave the \"Private key file\n\" field blank the first time you pack the extension.\n6.  **Click \"Pack extension\":**  When you do\n this, Chrome will create two files in the directory *above* your extension's root directory:\n    *   `your-\nextension-name.crx`: This is your packed extension file.\n    *   `your-extension-name.pem\n`: This is your private key. **It is crucial to save this file**, as you'll need it to pack\n any future updates to your extension.\n\n### Step 3: Test the Initial Installation and Permission Warnings\n\n1.  \n**Install the Packed Extension:** Drag and drop the newly created `.crx` file onto the `chrome://extensions` page.\n\n2.  **Observe the Permission Warning:** You will now see the initial permission warning, just as a new user would. This\n is your baseline for the permission warnings.\n\n### Step 4: Update Permissions and Repack the Extension\n\n1.\n  **Update `manifest.json`:** Now, modify your `manifest.json` file to include the new permissions that\n you want to test. For example, let's add the `\"tabs\"` permission.  You also **must increment\n the version number**.\n\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"name\": \"My Awesome Extension\",\n      \"\nversion\": \"1.1\",\n      \"manifest_version\": 3,\n      \"permissions\": [\n\n        \"storage\",\n        \"activeTab\",\n        \"tabs\" \n      ]\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Repack the Extension:**\n    *   Go back to `chrome://extensions` and click \"Pack\n extension\" again.\n    *   Select your extension's root directory as before.\n    *   This time, for\n the \"Private key file\" field, browse and select the `.pem` file that was generated when you packed the extension\n the first time.\n    *   Click \"Pack extension\".  This will create a new `.crx` file\n for version 1.1.\n\n### Step 5: Test the Update and the New Permission Warning\n\n1.  **\nInstall the Updated Extension:** Drag and drop the new `.crx` file (the one for version 1.1) onto the\n `chrome://extensions` page.\n2.  **Observe the New Permission Warning:** Chrome will now show a new permission warning\n, asking the user to accept the new permissions. The extension will be disabled until the user accepts the new permissions.\n\nThis\n process allows you to accurately simulate how users will experience permission changes when you publish updates to your extension on the Chrome Web Store\n.\n\n**Important Note for 2026 and Beyond:** While this is the established method for testing permission warnings\n, the world of web development is always evolving. It's a good practice to consult the official Chrome extension documentation for\n any changes to this process.","hint":"A good answer must explain that permission warnings only appear for packed (not unpacked) extensions and describe the correct 2026-compatible workflow: building a new version with changed permissions, using chrome://extensions “Pack extension” to generate a .crx, then installing/updating that .crx locally (or using Google’s extension update testing tooling) to trigger and view the permission-change warning dialog.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I test chrome extension permission warning updates locally by packing the extension in 2026?","timestamp":41062},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":41062},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770376995254-3b270eee3b3fb8","status":"completed","timestamp":41062},{"type":"message","content":"Testing","timestamp":41062},{"type":"message","content":" Chrome extension permission warning updates locally involves a multi-step process of packing your extension, installing","timestamp":41062},{"type":"message","content":" it, updating the permissions in your manifest, and then repacking and reinstalling it.

{"id":"websearch-1041","input":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","output":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?\n`govulncheck` is a tool from the Go team that analyzes your codebase to find\n known vulnerabilities. Go version compatibility errors are common and can prevent the tool from working correctly, or lead to inaccurate results. Here are the\n common causes and how to resolve them, with considerations for 2026.\n\n### Common Causes of Go Version Compatibility\n Errors\n\n1.  **Mismatched Go Versions:** The most frequent issue is a discrepancy between the Go version specified in your project\n's `go.mod` file and the version of the Go toolchain installed on your system (the one found in your\n `PATH`). `govulncheck` uses the installed toolchain, which can lead to incorrect analysis if it doesn\n't match the project's intended version.\n\n2.  **Outdated `go.mod` `go\n` Directive:** The `go` directive in your `go.mod` file may specify an older or improperly formatted Go version.\n As of early 2026, it is expected that the format will remain `1.x`.\n\n3.  \n**Binaries Built with Older Go Versions:** `govulncheck` has limited analysis capabilities for binaries built with Go versions prior\n to 1.18. It can only detect vulnerabilities in the standard library for these older binaries, potentially missing issues\n in third-party modules.\n\n4.  **Vulnerable Dependencies:** While not a direct Go version compatibility error,\n `govulncheck` will report vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. These are often resolved by updating the dependencies,\n which can be related to the Go version.\n\n### How to Resolve These Issues in 2026\n\n1\n.  **Synchronize Your Go Versions:**\n    *   **Update `go.mod`:** Open the `go.mod\n` file in your project and make sure the `go` directive points to a modern and valid Go version (e.g.,\n `go 1.26`).\n    *   **Verify Your Go Installation:** Run `go version` in your\n terminal to check the installed Go version. If it doesn't align with your `go.mod` file, it\n's best to update your Go installation to the latest stable release.\n    *   **Use `go mod tidy\n`:** After any changes to your `go.mod` file, run `go mod tidy`. This command cleans up and\n synchronizes your project's dependencies.\n\n2.  **Upgrade Vulnerable Modules:**\n    *   When `govuln\ncheck` reports a vulnerability, it usually provides the name of the affected module and the version that contains the fix.\n    \n*   You can upgrade to the latest patch version of a module by running `go get -u=patch <module_\nname>`.\n    *   Alternatively, you can upgrade to a specific version with `go get <module_name>\n@<version>`.\n    *   After upgrading, run `govulncheck ./...` again to confirm that the issue\n is resolved.\n\n3.  **Stay Current and Automate:**\n    *   **Keep Go Updated:** Regularly\n update your Go toolchain to the latest stable version to get the latest security patches and improvements.\n    *   **Integrate\n into CI/CD:** The best practice in 2026 is to integrate `govulncheck` into your\n Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. This will automatically scan your code for vulnerabilities on every build, catching issues early in the development process.","hint":"A good answer must note that govulncheck’s compatibility issues typically stem from mismatches between (a) the Go toolchain version in PATH and the version required by the module/tool (including `go`/`toolchain` directives in `go.mod` and CI settings) and (b) the Go version used to build or run govulncheck, causing errors like “package requires newer Go version” or use of an unavailable toolchain. It must describe concrete fixes such as aligning PATH/CI Go versions with `go.mod`, updating to a supported Go/govulncheck release, correcting invalid `go` directives (e.g., avoiding patch versions like `1.22.1`), or switching the active Go toolchain to match the project’s declared version.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","timestamp":34211},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":34211},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770376999761-6a92ae0f98f0b","status":"completed","timestamp":34211},{"type":"message","content":"`govulncheck` is a tool from the Go team that analyzes your codebase to find","timestamp":34211},{"type":"message","content":" known vulnerabilities.

Here's how to achieve it with a clean\n, efficient approach using pure CSS.\n\nThe core of this technique involves three main CSS properties:\n\n1.  `background\n-image`: We use a `radial-gradient` to create the desired color effect.\n2.  `background-\nclip: text`: This crucial property clips the background, so it only appears where the text is.\n3.  \n`color: transparent`: We make the text color itself transparent to reveal the clipped gradient background behind it.\n\nThe hover effect is\n created by transitioning the `background-size` and `background-position` of the gradient, giving it a dynamic,\n expanding overlay appearance.\n\n### Complete HTML and CSS Example\n\nHere is a full code example you can use directly in your project.\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"\nUTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=\n1.0\">\n    <title>CSS Background-Clip Text Hover Effect</title>\n    <style>\n\n        /* Basic page styling for contrast */\n        body {\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content\n: center;\n            align-items: center;\n            min-height: 100vh;\n\n            margin: 0;\n            background-color: #111827; /* Dark background */\n\n            font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto,\n Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n        }\n\n\n        .gradient-text {\n            font-size: 6rem;\n            font-weight: 800;\n\n            cursor: pointer;\n            position: relative; /* Needed for positioning pseudo-elements if you add them */\n\n            \n            /* 1.

This guide will walk you through the basics\n of using GitHub Desktop without any programming knowledge.\n\n### **1. Installation and Setup**\n\n*   **Create a\n GitHub Account:** If you don't already have one, sign up for a free account on [github.com](https\n://github.com).\n*   **Download GitHub Desktop:** Visit the official GitHub Desktop website and download the application for\n your operating system.\n*   **Sign in to GitHub Desktop:**\n    1.  Open the GitHub Desktop application.\n\n    2.  Go to **File** > **Options** (on Windows) or **GitHub Desktop** > **Preferences**\n (on macOS).\n    3.  In the **Accounts** section, click **Sign In** and follow the prompts\n to authorize your GitHub account.\n\n### **2. Creating Your First Project (Repository)**\n\nIn GitHub, a project\n is called a **repository** (or **repo**). It's a folder that contains all the files for your project\n, along with the history of changes.\n\n*   **Create a New Repository:**\n    1.  In GitHub Desktop, go\n to **File** > **New Repository**.\n    2.  Give your repository a name (e.g.,\n \"My-Novel\" or \"Website-Designs\").\n    3.  Choose a local path on your computer where you want\n to save the project.\n    4.  It's a good practice to check the box to **Initialize this\n repository with a README**. A README file is a place to write a description of your project.\n    5.  Click **\nCreate Repository**.\n\n### **3. Making and Saving Changes (Commits)**\n\nA **commit** is a snapshot\n of your project at a specific point in time. It's like saving a version of your work that you can always go\n back to.\n\n*   **Make Changes:**\n    1.  Open the project folder on your computer.\n    2.\n  Create, edit, or delete files as you normally would.\n*   **Commit Your Changes:**\n    1.  Open\n GitHub Desktop. You'll see a list of the files you've changed on the left.\n    2.\n  At the bottom of the window, write a short summary of the changes you made in the **Summary** field. This\n will be your **commit message**.\n    3.  Click the **Commit to main** button.\n\n### **4\n. Sharing Your Project Online (Publishing)**\n\nTo back up your project and share it with others, you need to **publish**\n your local repository to your GitHub account.\n\n*   **Publish Your Repository:**\n    1.  After you'\nve made your first commit, a **Publish repository** button will appear in the main window. Click it.\n    \n2.  You can choose to keep the repository private or make it public.\n    3.  Click **Publish Repository\n**.\n\n### **5. Keeping Your Project in Sync (Pushing and Pulling)**\n\n*   **Pushing\n Changes:** When you make new commits on your local computer, you need to **push** them to your online repository to\n keep it up to date. Click the **Push origin** button in GitHub Desktop to upload your changes.\n*   **Pull\ning Changes:** If you're collaborating with others, you'll need to **pull** their changes to your local\n computer. Click the **Pull origin** button to download the latest version of the project.\n\n### **6. Working on\n Different Versions (Branches)**\n\nA **branch** is a separate version of your project where you can experiment without affecting the main\n version. The main version is usually called the **main** branch.\n\n*   **Create a New Branch:**\n    1.\n  In GitHub Desktop, click the **Current Branch** dropdown and select **New Branch**.\n    2.  Give\n your new branch a name (e.g., \"Chapter-2-Draft\" or \"New-Homepage-Design\").\n\n*   **Switching Branches:** You can switch between branches by clicking the **Current Branch** dropdown and selecting the branch\n you want to work on.\n*   **Merging Branches:** When you're happy with the changes you've\n made in a branch, you can **merge** them into your main branch to combine the two versions.\n    1.  \nSwitch to the `main` branch.\n    2.

Here's a comprehensive guide to implementing it.\n\n### Key Requirement: Add to Home Screen\n\nFor\n web push notifications to work on iOS, the user must first add your web app to their Home Screen. This action saves\n the web app as a PWA on their device, enabling features like push notifications.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n Guide\n\nHere are the steps to enable web push notifications for your web app on Safari for iOS:\n\n#### 1. Create\n a Web App Manifest File\n\nThe web app manifest is a JSON file that tells the browser about your PWA and how\n it should behave when installed on the user's device. Create a file named `manifest.json` in the root directory\n of your project with the following content:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your Web App Name\",\n\n  \"short_name\": \"Your App\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \n\"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \n\"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    \n},\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \n\"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    \n}\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholder values with your app's information and provide\n the corresponding icon files.\n\n#### 2. Link the Manifest File in Your HTML\n\nIn the `<head>` section of\n your main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`), add a link to your `manifest.json\n` file:\n\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n\n#### 3\n. Create a Service Worker\n\nA service worker is a script that runs in the background, separate from your web page.\n It's essential for receiving and handling push notifications. Create a file named `service-worker.js` in your\n root directory with the following code:\n\n\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  const data\n = event.data.json();\n  const options = {\n    body: data.body,\n    icon: '/\nicon-192x192.png',\n    badge: '/badge-72x72.png'\n\n  };\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data.title, options)\n  );\n\n});\n\n```\n\n\nThis code listens for a `push` event and displays a notification with the title and body received from\n your server.\n\n#### 4. Register the Service Worker\n\nIn your main JavaScript file, add the following code to register\n the service worker when the page loads:\n\n\n```javascript\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator\n.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')\n    .then(function(registration) {\n      console.\nlog('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);\n    })\n    .catch(function(error) {\n\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n\n```\n\n\n#### 5\n. Requesting Notification Permission\n\nOn iOS, you can only request notification permission after a user interaction, such as a button click. Add\n a button to your HTML:\n\n\n```html\n<button id=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe to Notifications</button>\n\n```\n\n\nThen, in your JavaScript, add an event listener to this button to handle the subscription process:\n\n\n```javascript\n\nconst subscribeButton = document.getElementById('subscribe-button');\n\nsubscribeButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {\n\n  try {\n    const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n    if (permission === 'granted') {\n      \nconsole.log('Notification permission granted.');\n      const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n      const\n subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n        userVisibleOnly: true,\n        applicationServerKey: url\nBase64ToUint8Array('YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY')\n      });\n      \n\n      // Send the subscription object to your server\n      await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n    } else {\n      console\n.log('Notification permission denied.');\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('\nFailed to subscribe to push notifications:', error);\n  }\n});\n\n// Helper function to convert VAPID key\n\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat\n((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (\nbase64String + padding)\n    .replace(/\\-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/\n');\n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8\nArray(rawData.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++\ni) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return\n outputArray;\n}\n\nasync function sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription) {\n  // Implement this function to send the\n subscription object to your server\n  // Example:\n  // await fetch('/api/subscribe', {\n  //   method:\n 'POST',\n  //   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n  //   body:\n JSON.stringify(subscription)\n  // });\n}\n\n```\n\n\nReplace `'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC\n_KEY'` with the public key from your server's VAPID key pair.\n\n### Server-Side Requirements\n\n\nTo send push notifications, you need a server that can:\n\n1.  **Generate VAPID keys:** These keys are\n used to identify your server to the push service.\n2.  **Store user subscriptions:** When a user subscribes\n, you need to save their subscription object in a database.\n3.  **Send push messages:** Your server will\n use the stored subscriptions to send notifications to the correct users via the push service.\n\nThere are many libraries available for different\n backend languages (e.g., `web-push` for Node.js) that can help you with this.\n\n### Regarding\n the \"2025 Documentation\"\n\nThe information provided here is based on the current implementation of the Push API in Safari\n on iOS 16.4 and later. While the core concepts are stable, there are always ongoing developments in web\n standards.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, there are discussions about a new \"Declarative Web Push\" API that\n could simplify the process, but this is not yet implemented. For now, the steps outlined above are the correct way to implement web push\n notifications for Safari on iOS.","hint":"A correct answer must explain that web push on iOS/iPadOS only works for Safari-installed Home Screen web apps (PWAs) on iOS 16.4+ and must outline the core technical setup: HTTPS PWA with web app manifest and service worker, using the standard Push API/Notification API flow (register service worker, request permission on a user gesture inside the Home Screen app, obtain push subscription, and send via Apple’s Web Push/APNs endpoints) in line with Apple’s 2025/modern documentation.【page2websearch1 page6websearch1 page7websearch1 page9websearch1 page12websearch1 page16websearch1 page18websearch1","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":81482},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":81482},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377014091-dec46a48d53cf","status":"completed","timestamp":81482},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377036212-a47f9dba058a3","status":"completed","timestamp":81482},{"type":"message","content":"Setting up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari for iOS 16.4 and later requires a","timestamp":81482},{"type":"message","content":" specific approach that centers around the \"Add to Home Screen\" feature, which turns your web app into a Progressive Web App (","timestamp":81482},{"type":"message","content":"PWA).

Here's a\n recommended setup:\n\n*   **Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)?** Yes\n*   **Which style would\n you like to use?** Default\n*   **Which color would you like to use as base color?** Slate\n\n*   **Where is your global CSS file?** `apps/web/app/globals.css`\n\n*   **Would you like to use CSS variables for colors?** Yes\n*   **Where is your tailwind.config.\njs located?** `apps/web/tailwind.config.js`\n*   **Configure the import alias for\n components?** `@/components`\n*   **Configure the import alias for utils?** `@/lib/utils`\n\n*   **Are you using React Server Components?** Yes\n*   **Write configuration to components.json.** Yes\n\n\n### Step 3: Create a shared UI package\n\nCreate a new package in your `packages` directory called `ui`.\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/ui\n```\n\n\n### Step 4: Configure the shared UI package\n\n1.  Create\n a `package.json` file in `packages/ui` with the following content:\n\n    \n```json\n    \n{\n      \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n      \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n\n      \"private\": true,\n      \"exports\": {\n        \"./button\": \"./src/button.tsx\",\n        \"./\ncard\": \"./src/card.tsx\",\n        \"./code\": \"./src/code.tsx\"\n      },\n\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"lint\": \"eslint . --max-warnings 0\",\n        \"generate\n:component\": \"turbo gen react-component\"\n      },\n      \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"@repo/eslint\n-config\": \"*\",\n        \"@repo/typescript-config\": \"*\",\n        \"@turbo/gen\": \"^\n1.12.4\",\n        \"@types/node\": \"^20.11.24\",\n        \"@\ntypes/eslint\": \"^8.56.5\",\n        \"@types/react\": \"^18.2\n.61\",\n        \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18.2.19\",\n        \"\neslint\": \"^8.57.0\",\n        \"react\": \"^18.2.0\",\n        \n\"typescript\": \"^5.3.3\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  Create\n a `tsconfig.json` file in `packages/ui`:\n\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"extends\n\": \"@repo/typescript-config/react-library.json\",\n      \"include\": [\"src\"],\n      \"\nexclude\": [\"node_modules\", \"dist\"]\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 5: Add components\n to the shared UI package\n\nNow you can start adding shadcn UI components to your shared UI package. For example, to add\n a button component, run the following command from the root of your monorepo:\n\n\n```bash\nnpx shad\ncn-ui@latest add button --path=packages/ui/src\n\n```\n\n\n### Step 6: Use\n the shared components in your app\n\nNow you can import and use the components from your shared UI package in your web application\n.\n\nFor example, in your `apps/web/app/page.tsx` file, you can import the button\n component like this:\n\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/button\";\n\nexport default function Page\n() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </main\n>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully set up shadcn UI in a\n Turborepo monorepo and create a shared UI library for all your applications.","hint":"A correct answer must explain how to initialize and configure shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo, including using the shadcn CLI with monorepo support, creating or using a shared `ui` (or similar) package, wiring Tailwind CSS/config so the shared components work across apps, and importing/using those components from individual app workspaces.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":32533},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":32533},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377125729-ff7f50334c2908","status":"completed","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":" shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo in 2026.\n\n### Step 1: Create","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":" a new Turborepo\n\nIf you don't have an existing Turborepo, create a new one using the following command:","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"\n\n","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"```bash\nbunx create-turbo@latest\n```","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"\n\n### Step 2: Initialize shadcn UI\n\n","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"Navigate to the root of your monorepo and run the following command to initialize shadcn UI:\n\n","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"```bash\nn","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"px shadcn-ui@latest init\n","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"```","timestamp":32533},{"type":"message","content":"\n\nYou will be prompted to answer a few questions.

{"id":"websearch-1470","input":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","output":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026\nTo handle React `onClick` interactions for checkbox labels and inputs in\n 2026, follow these best practices for accessibility and state management:\n\n### 1. Correctly Associate Labels and\n Inputs\n\nLink the `<label>` to the `<input>` using the `htmlFor` attribute on the label, which corresponds to the\n `id` of the input. This is the cornerstone of accessible checkboxes, as it allows screen readers to announce the label when the\n input is focused and lets users toggle the checkbox by clicking the label.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```jsx\n<label htmlFor=\"my\nCheckbox\">Click me</label>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"myCheckbox\" />\n\n```\n\n\n### \n2. Use `onChange` for State Management\n\nThe `onChange` event handler should be attached to the `<input>` element,\n not the `<label>`. This event will fire when the checkbox's state changes, regardless of whether the user clicks\n the checkbox directly or the associated label.\n\n### 3. Implement Controlled Components\n\nFor robust state management, use React'\ns `useState` hook to control the `checked` state of the checkbox. This makes your component a \"controlled component,\" where the\n component's state is the single source of truth.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from '\nreact';\n\nfunction MyCheckbox() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  \nconst handleChange = (event) => {\n    setIsChecked(event.target.checked);\n  };\n\n  \nreturn (\n    <div>\n      <label htmlFor=\"terms\">Accept Terms and Conditions</label>\n      <input\n\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        id=\"terms\"\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={handleChange}\n\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Group Related Checkboxes Semantically\n\nWhen\n you have a group of related checkboxes, wrap them in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`. This improves the\n semantic structure of your form and makes it more accessible.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```jsx\n<fieldset>\n  <\nlegend>Select your interests</legend>\n  <div>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"coding\" name=\"\ninterests\" value=\"coding\" />\n    <label htmlFor=\"coding\">Coding</label>\n  </div>\n  \n<div>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"music\" name=\"interests\" value=\"music\" />\n    \n<label htmlFor=\"music\">Music</label>\n  </div>\n</fieldset>\n\n```\n\n\nBy following these guidelines\n, you'll create accessible, robust, and maintainable checkbox interactions in your React applications.","hint":"A strong answer should explain that in modern React you normally handle checkbox interaction with a controlled component using the `checked` prop and `onChange` (not `onClick`) on the `<input type=\"checkbox\">`, and use a `<label>` correctly associated via `htmlFor`/`id` (or wrapping the input) so clicks on the label toggle the checkbox while preserving keyboard and screen‑reader accessibility.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","timestamp":28407},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":28407},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377167522-63ec96eacb4ca8","status":"completed","timestamp":28407},{"type":"message","content":"To handle React `onClick` interactions for checkbox labels and inputs in","timestamp":28407},{"type":"message","content":" 2026, follow these best practices for accessibility and state management:\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1408","input":"How can I use SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models in 2025?","output":"How can I use SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models in 2025?\nBy \n2025, using SAE (Sparse Autoencoder) feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models will involve a combination\n of established techniques and emerging best practices. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this, based on the current trajectory\n of research:\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms:\n\n*   **Mechanistic Interpretability**:\n This is the study of a model's internal workings to understand *how* it performs a task. Instead of just looking\n at inputs and outputs, you analyze the model's components (neurons, attention heads, etc.) to reverse-engineer its\n algorithms.\n*   **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**: SAEs are a type of neural network used to discover\n and extract a large number of fine-grained, interpretable features (often called \"monosemantic features\") from the activations\n of a larger model. They help to address the problem of \"superposition,\" where a single neuron in a large model might\n be involved in representing multiple unrelated concepts.\n*   **Feature Steering**: This is the process of causally intervening in a\n model's processing by activating or suppressing specific features identified by a tool like an SAE. The goal is to \"steer\" the\n model's output in a desired direction.\n\n### How to Use SAE Feature Steering in Multilingual Models in 202\n5\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to use SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models:\n\n\n1.  **Train Sparse Autoencoders on a Multilingual Model**:\n    *   Select a multilingual large language model (LL\nM) you want to interpret.\n    *   Train SAEs on the internal activations (e.g., from the residual\n stream or MLP layers) of this model. The goal is to extract a set of sparse, interpretable features. Each\n feature should ideally correspond to a single, understandable concept (monosemanticity).\n\n2.  **Identify and\n Characterize Language-Specific Features**:\n    *   Once you have your SAEs, you need to identify which features\n are related to language. You can do this by running text in different languages through the model and observing which SAE features activate\n.\n    *   For example, you might find features that consistently fire for French text, or more granularly, features that\n correspond to grammatical structures specific to a certain language.\n\n3.  **Develop Steering Vectors**:\n    *   A\n steering vector is a direction in the model's activation space that, when added to the model's activations, pushes\n the model's behavior in a certain direction.\n    *   To create a steering vector for a specific language,\n you would take the features you identified in the previous step and combine them.\n    *   By 202\n5, more advanced techniques like **SAE-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS)** are being developed. These methods create\n more precise steering vectors that target specific SAE features while minimizing unintended side effects on the model's overall performance and coherence.\n\n\n4.  **Perform Causal Interventions (Steering)**:\n    *   With your steering vector, you\n can now intervene in the model's processing. As the model is generating text, you can add your steering vector to its\n activations at a specific layer.\n    *   For example, you could provide the model with a prompt in English and apply\n a \"French\" steering vector to guide the model to produce a French translation, while preserving the original meaning of the prompt.\n\n\n5.  **Analyze the Results**:\n    *   The final step is to analyze the effect of your intervention. Did\n the model's output change as expected? Were there any unexpected side effects?\n    *   This analysis is crucial for understanding the\n causal role of the features you've identified and for building a more complete mechanistic understanding of the model's multilingual capabilities.\n\n###\n Important Considerations and Future Trends for 2025\n\n*   **Feature Selection is Critical**: Research shows that not\n all features learned by SAEs are equally useful for steering. It's important to distinguish between \"input features\" (\nwhich capture patterns in the input) and \"output features\" (which have a clear effect on the model's output).\n You will need to filter for features with high \"output scores\" to achieve effective steering.\n*   **Feature Consistency**: A\n known challenge is that SAEs can learn inconsistent features across different training runs.

Install Swiper\n\nFirst, you need to install the\n Swiper library. Open your terminal and run the following command:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n```\n\n\n### \n2. Create the Slider Component\n\nNext, create a new component for your slider. Create a file named `Slider.tsx` inside\n a `components` directory in your `src` folder.\n\n\n```typescript\n// src/components/Slider.tsx\n'\nuse client';\n\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper\n/react';\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination\n';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay } from 'swiper/modules';\n\nconst Slider = () => {\n\n  const images = [\n    '/images/slide1.jpg',\n    '/images/slide2.jpg',\n\n    '/images/slide3.jpg',\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w\n-full\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n        spaceBetween={50}\n\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{ delay: 30\n00, disableOnInteraction: false }}\n        loop={true}\n        className=\"mySwiper\"\n\n      >\n        {images.map((src, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n\n            <div className=\"w-full h-96 relative\">\n              <Image\n                src={src}\n                alt\n={`Slide ${index + 1}`}\n                layout=\"fill\"\n                objectFit=\"cover\"\n              />\n            </div>\n\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n\nexport default Slider;\n\n```\n\n\n**Note:** Make sure to replace the image paths in the `images` array\n with the actual paths to your images located in the `public` directory.\n\n### 3. Add Slider to Your\n Page\n\nNow, you can use the `Slider` component in any of your pages. For example, to add it to\n your homepage, open `src/app/page.tsx` and import the `Slider` component.\n\n\n```typescript\n// src\n/app/page.tsx\nimport Slider from '../components/Slider';\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  \nreturn (\n    <main className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-2\n4\">\n      <h1 className=\"text-4xl font-bold mb-8\">My Awesome Slider</h1>\n      <\nSlider />\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Add CSS Styles\n\nTo\n ensure the slider is styled correctly and is full-width, you'll need to add some CSS. Open your `src/app\n/globals.css` file and add the following styles:\n\n\n```css\n.swiper-button-next,\n\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: #ffffff !important;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-\nbullet-active {\n  background-color: #ffffff !important;\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThese styles will make\n the navigation arrows and active pagination bullet white, which will provide better visibility on dark images.\n\n### 5. Run\n Your Application\n\nNow you can run your application to see the slider in action:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n\nOpen\n your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see a full-width responsive image slider.\n\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n*   **`'use client';`**: This directive is necessary because Swiper uses React hooks\n, which are only available in client components.\n*   **`import 'swiper/css';`**: This line\n imports the basic styles for Swiper.\n*   **`modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}`**: This\n enables the Navigation, Pagination, and Autoplay modules for the slider.\n*   **`spaceBetween={50}\n`**: This adds a 50px space between each slide.\n*   **`slidesPerView={1}`**: This shows\n one slide at a time.\n*   **`navigation`**: This enables the next and previous buttons.\n*   **\n`pagination={{ clickable: true }}`**: This enables clickable pagination bullets.\n*   **`autoplay={{ delay: 3\n000, disableOnInteraction: false }}`**: This enables autoplay with a 3-second delay and keeps\n it running even after user interaction.\n*   **`loop={true}`**: This enables continuous looping of the slides.\n\n*   **`next/image` with `layout=\"fill\"` and `objectFit=\"cover\"`**: This makes\n the image fill the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio, which is crucial for a responsive full-width slider.\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a beautiful and responsive image slider for your Next.js application.","hint":"A correct answer should describe using Swiper’s React integration with Next.js in a client component (`'use client'`), importing `Swiper`/`SwiperSlide` and Swiper CSS, and rendering slides that use the Next.js `Image` component (typically with `fill`/responsive layout and parent with relative positioning) to achieve a full-width, responsive slider; it should also mention configuring Swiper options (e.g., breakpoints or `slidesPerView`, navigation/pagination) so the slider adapts to different screen sizes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":53063},{"type":"tool_call","name":"run_shell_command","status":"pending","timestamp":53063},{"type":"tool_call","name":"run_shell_command-1770377146801-c46967497294f","status":"completed","timestamp":53063},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":53063},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377153182-80eb845dc1f19","status":"completed","timestamp":53063},{"type":"message","content":"To build a full-width responsive image slider in your Next.js application using the `next/image` component","timestamp":53063},{"type":"message","content":" and Swiper, follow these steps:\n\n### 1.

It is a sophisticated method that combines several techniques to execute malicious code within\n the context of a legitimate process, making it difficult for security software to identify.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how\n the technique works:\n\n**1. Decoy DLL Selection:**\n\nThe attacker first selects a legitimate DLL that is likely\n to be loaded by the target process. This could be a common Windows DLL or a DLL used by the target application. The\n goal is to choose a DLL that will not arouse suspicion when it is loaded.\n\n**2. Decoy DLL Loading\n:**\n\nThe attacker uses the `LoadLibraryEx` API function to load the decoy DLL into the address space of the target\n process. This is a standard Windows function, so it is unlikely to be flagged as malicious by security software.\n\n**3\n. Memory Hollowing:**\n\nOnce the decoy DLL is loaded, the attacker \"hollows out\" its memory space\n. This is done by unmapping the original code of the DLL and replacing it with the malicious payload. The attacker can\n use a variety of techniques to achieve this, such as `VirtualAllocEx` and `WriteProcessMemory`.\n\n**4.\n Execution:**\n\nFinally, the attacker executes the malicious payload. This can be done by creating a new thread in the target process that\n points to the entry point of the malicious code or by hijacking an existing thread.\n\n**Why this technique is effective:**\n\n\n*   **Stealthy:** By using a legitimate DLL as a decoy, the attacker can evade detection by security\n software that is looking for suspicious DLLs being loaded into processes.\n*   **Bypasses whitelisting:** Application\n whitelisting solutions can be bypassed because the decoy DLL is a legitimate and signed file.\n*   **Difficult to analyze\n:** The malicious code is only present in memory, making it difficult for forensic analysts to recover and analyze.\n\n**Evolution\n in 2024:**\n\nIn 2024, attackers are continuing to evolve this technique to bypass\n the latest security measures. Some of the new developments include:\n\n*   **Module Stomping:** This is a variation\n of memory hollowing where the attacker overwrites the memory of a loaded module without unmapping it first. This makes it even\n more difficult to detect.\n*   **Process Doppelgänging:** In this technique, the attacker creates a process from\n a legitimate executable but replaces the code with a malicious payload before it is executed.\n*   **Ghostwriting:** This\n is a technique where the attacker writes malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process without calling any suspicious API functions.\n\n**\nConclusion:**\n\nLoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection is a powerful and versatile technique that is likely to remain a popular\n choice for malware authors in the years to come.

Here's a general guide\n on how you can do it:\n\n### 1. **Install a Plugin**\n\nYou'll need a Figma\n plugin that can handle JSON data. Some of the most popular and effective options available in 2026 are:\n\n\n- **JSON to Figma**: As its name suggests, this plugin is specifically designed to convert JSON data into Figma nodes. It\n's a great choice for direct, no-fuss conversions.\n\n- **Content Reel**: A powerful plugin from Microsoft that\n allows you to populate your designs with realistic content. It supports JSON, so you can easily import your data and map it to your layers\n.\n\n- **Builder.io**: If you're using a headless CMS, this plugin is perfect for pulling content\n, including JSON, directly into your Figma designs.\n\n### 2. **Prepare Your JSON File**\n\nBefore you can\n import your designs, you'll need to structure your data in a JSON file. The exact format will depend on the\n plugin you're using, but it will typically involve a hierarchical structure that mirrors the layers you want to create in Figma.\n\n\nFor example, a simple JSON file might look something like this:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Frame\n\",\n  \"type\": \"FRAME\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"\nMy Rectangle\",\n      \"type\": \"RECTANGLE\",\n      \"fills\": [\n        {\n          \"type\":\n \"SOLID\",\n          \"color\": {\n            \"r\": 1,\n            \"g\": 0\n,\n            \"b\": 0,\n            \"a\": 1\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"My Text\",\n      \"type\": \"TEXT\",\n\n      \"characters\": \"Hello, world!\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. **Use\n the Plugin to Import Your Designs**\n\nOnce you have your JSON file ready, you can use your chosen plugin to import\n it into Figma. The exact steps will vary depending on the plugin, but you'll typically need to:\n\n1. **Open\n the plugin** in Figma.\n2. **Select your JSON file** or paste the JSON data directly into the plugin\n.\n3. **Map the JSON data** to Figma layers and properties.\n4. **Run the plugin** to generate the\n nodes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure and import your\n designs in 2026. This is a great way to automate your design workflow and ensure consistency between your designs and\n your data.","hint":"Reward answers that explain using (or building) a Figma plugin that parses a JSON structure and programmatically creates Figma nodes (frames/components/other SceneNodes) matching that hierarchy via the Figma Plugin API (e.g., `figma.createFrame`, `figma.createComponent`, setting properties/children from JSON), and that mention how this enables importing or reconstructing designs from JSON data rather than manually drawing them.[[1, 2, 3]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","timestamp":50437},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":50437},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377266967-a4d6980b504b2","status":"completed","timestamp":50437},{"type":"message","content":"In 2026","timestamp":50437},{"type":"message","content":", you can use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs.

The package\n you're likely looking for is not `vite-plugin-vue-cron`, but rather a Vue component library for\n cron expressions that is compatible with Vue 3 and Element Plus.\n\nBased on the latest information for 202\n6, the recommended package is `@vue-js-cron/element-plus`. It's a component that integrates\n seamlessly with Element Plus. An alternative is `vue3-cron-plus`.\n\nHere is a guide on how to use\n `@vue-js-cron/element-plus`:\n\n### Step 1: Create a Vue 3 Project with Vite\n\n\nIf you don't have an existing project, create a new one:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm create vue@latest\n```\n\n\n\nFollow the CLI prompts to set up your new Vue 3 project.\n\n### Step 2: Install and Set Up Element Plus\n\n\n1.  Install Element Plus and the required icons library:\n\n    \n```bash\n    npm install element-plus @element-plus\n/icons-vue\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  Import and register Element Plus in your `src/main.js` file\n:\n\n    \n```javascript\n    import { createApp } from 'vue';\n    import ElementPlus from 'element-plus';\n\n    import 'element-plus/dist/index.css';\n    import * as ElementPlusIconsVue from '@\nelement-plus/icons-vue';\n    import App from './App.vue';\n\n    const app = createApp\n(App);\n\n    app.use(ElementPlus);\n    for (const [key, component] of Object\n.entries(ElementPlusIconsVue)) {\n      app.component(key, component);\n    }\n    app.mount\n('#app');\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 3: Install `@vue-js-cron/element-plus`\n\n1\n.  Install the cron editor package:\n\n    \n```bash\n    npm install @vue-js-cron/element\n-plus\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  Import the component's CSS in `src/main.js`:\n\n    \n```javascript\n    import '@vue-js-cron/element-plus/dist/element-plus.css';\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 4: Use the Cron Editor in Your Application\n\nYou can now use the `<CronElementPlus\n />` component in any of your Vue components. Here is a simple example for `src/App.vue`:\n\n\n```vue\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\nimport { CronElementPlus } from\n '@vue-js-cron/element-plus';\n\nconst cronExpression = ref('* * * * *');\n\nconst\n handleCronChange = (newCron) => {\n  cronExpression.value = newCron;\n};\n</\nscript>\n\n<template>\n  <div style=\"padding: 20px;\">\n    <el-\ncard>\n      <template #header>\n        <h1>Vue 3 Cron Editor</h1>\n      </template>\n      <\ncron-element-plus\n        v-model=\"cronExpression\"\n        @change=\"handleCronChange\"\n      \n></cron-element-plus>\n      <p style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">\n        <strong>Current Cron\n Expression:</strong> {{ cronExpression }}\n      </p>\n    </el-card>\n  </div>\n</\ntemplate>\n\n```\n\n\n### Alternative: Using `vue3-cron-plus`\n\nIf you prefer another option, \n`vue3-cron-plus` is also a great choice.\n\n1.  **Install the package:**\n    \n```bash\n    npm install vue3-cron-plus\n    ```\n\n\n2.  **Register it globally in `src\n/main.js`:**\n    \n```javascript\n    import vue3CronPlus from 'vue3-cron-plus';\n\n    import 'vue3-cron-plus/dist/index.css';\n\n    app.use(vue3Cron\nPlus);\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Use it in your components:**\n    \n```vue\n    <vue\n3CronPlus @change=\"changeCron\" />\n    \n```","hint":"Answer must (1) identify `vite-plugin-vue-cron` as a Vite plugin that integrates a Vue cron expression UI (likely from `@vue-js-cron/element-plus`) into a Vue 3 project, and (2) describe, at least roughly, how to configure it in `vite.config.(ts|js)` alongside `@vitejs/plugin-vue` and Element Plus (e.g., adding the plugin to `plugins`, and importing/using the Element Plus cron component in Vue components).

{"id":"websearch-1804","input":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","output":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024\nTo set up\n a custom color palette for a mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS in 2024, you'll primarily\n work within your `tailwind.config.js` file. Here’s a breakdown of the process and best practices:\n\n\n### 1. Define Your Custom Colors\n\nThe best practice is to extend the default color palette with your own custom colors. This\n gives you access to your brand colors while still being able to use Tailwind's built-in colors if needed.\n\n\n**In your `tailwind.config.js` file:**\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        'primary': '#007BFF',\n        'secondary':\n '#6C757D',\n        'success': '#28A745',\n        'danger': '#\nDC3545',\n        'warning': '#FFC107',\n        'info': '#\n17A2B8',\n        'light': '#F8F9FA',\n        'dark': '#3\n43A40',\n        // You can also add shades\n        'primary-dark': '#0056\nb3',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Tips\n for defining colors:**\n*   **Use semantic names:** `primary`, `secondary`, `accent` are more descriptive of\n a color's purpose than names like `bright-blue`. This makes your design system more maintainable.\n*   **Online\n Tools:** You can use a color palette generator tool like `uicolors.app` to help you create a palette and export\n it in the correct format for your `tailwind.config.js`.\n\n### 2. Apply Colors with a Mobile-\nFirst Approach\n\nTailwind is built on the principle of mobile-first design. This means that styles applied without a responsive\n prefix (e.g., `bg-primary`) apply to all screen sizes, from the smallest up.\n\nTo\n apply different styles on larger screens, you use responsive prefixes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl\n:`, and `2xl:`.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you have a `div` that\n you want to have a primary background on mobile and a secondary background on medium screens and larger.\n\n\n```html\n<div class=\"\nbg-primary p-4 md:bg-secondary\">\n  <p class=\"text-white\">This background\n is primary on mobile, and secondary on larger screens.</p>\n</div>\n\n```\n\n\n**How it works:**\n\n*   `bg-primary`: This class applies to all screen sizes, setting the initial background color for mobile devices.\n\n*   `md:bg-secondary`: This class will only apply at the `md` breakpoint (typically 768\npx) and above, overriding the `bg-primary` style.\n\n### 3. Practical Example: Responsive Button\n\n\nHere is a button that uses your custom colors and changes its appearance on larger screens.\n\n\n```html\n<button\n class=\"bg-success text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\n               hover:bg-green\n-600\n               md:bg-info md:hover:bg-blue-600\">\n\n  Click me\n</button>\n\n```\n\n*   **On mobile screens:** The button has a `success` background and will\n darken on hover.\n*   **On medium screens and larger (`md:`):** The button's background changes\n to your custom `info` color.\n\nBy following this approach, you can create a design system with a consistent,\n branded color palette that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.","hint":"A correct answer should explain how to define/extend a custom color palette in Tailwind’s configuration for 2024-era Tailwind (e.g., using `theme.extend.colors` or the v4 `@theme` directive) and then demonstrate using those custom colors via utility classes in a mobile‑first, responsive context (e.g., breakpoint-prefixed classes like `sm:bg-primary-500`, `md:text-brand-700` that build from a base mobile style).","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","timestamp":43132},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":43132},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377333263-124b4f8eca2ca8","status":"completed","timestamp":43132},{"type":"message","content":"To set up","timestamp":43132},{"type":"message","content":" a custom color palette for a mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS in 2024, you'll primarily","timestamp":43132},{"type":"message","content":" work within your `tailwind.config.js` file.

As of February 2026, official support for Laravel 12 has not been added to the package.\n\n\nHere are a few ways you can address this for use with a future Laravel 12 project:\n\n### 1. Wait for\n an Official Update\n\nThe most straightforward approach is to wait for the package maintainer to add support for Laravel 12. You\n can monitor the package's repository on GitHub for new releases that include this support.\n\n### 2. Use a Community\n Fork (if available)\n\nIt is possible that another developer has created a fork of the package and updated it for Laravel 12\n. You can search on GitHub for forks of `shetabit/visitor` that have recent updates.\n\n### \n3. Fork the Package Yourself\n\nIf you need to use the package with Laravel 12 before it's officially supported,\n you can create your own fork and update the version constraints in the `composer.json` file.\n\nHere are the general\n steps:\n\n1.  **Fork the repository:** Go to the `shetabit/visitor` GitHub repository and\n create a fork.\n2.  **Clone your fork:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine.\n\n3.  **Modify `composer.json`:** Open the `composer.json` file and in the `require\n` section, update the `illuminate/support` constraint to include version 12. It might look something like this\n:\n\n    \n```json\n    \"require\": {\n        \"php\": \"^7.3|^8.0\",\n\n        \"illuminate/support\": \"^8.0|^9.0|^10.0|^11.0\n|^12.0\"\n    },\n    \n```\n\n4.  **Push the changes:** Commit and push the\n changes to your forked repository on GitHub.\n5.  **Update your project's `composer.json\n`:** In your Laravel project's `composer.json`, you need to point to your forked repository. You can do this by\n adding a `repositories` section and updating the `require` section:\n\n    \n```json\n    \"repositories\": [\n\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/\nYOUR_USERNAME/visitor\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/\nvisitor\": \"dev-master\"\n    },\n    \n```\n\n    Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/visitor` with the path\n to your forked repository.\n6.  **Run composer update:** Run `composer update` in your project to install\n your modified version of the package.\n\n### 4. Look for Alternatives\n\nIf the package is not updated in a timely manner\n, or if you prefer not to maintain a fork, you can search for alternative Laravel packages that provide similar visitor tracking functionality and\n are compatible with Laravel 12. You can search for packages on Packagist or through community forums.","hint":"A good answer should explain that `shetabit/visitor` depends on `illuminate/support` and that Laravel already provides `illuminate/support` via `laravel/framework`, so you must adjust or remove any direct `illuminate/support` constraint (or update the package/version constraint) to avoid version conflicts when targeting Laravel 10–12. It should mention using compatible Composer constraints for `shetabit/visitor` and Laravel (e.g., via Packagist or Laravel Shift) and resolving the “laravel/framework replaces illuminate/support and thus cannot coexist with it” style conflict.

While specific documentation for \"one-api\" and \"new-api\" is not publicly available, here is a general guide\n based on common payment API integration practices.\n\n### General Integration Steps\n\n1.  **Obtain API Credentials:**\n    \n*   Register for a merchant account with YiPay.\n    *   Log in to your merchant dashboard to obtain your\n API Key, Merchant ID, and other necessary credentials.\n\n2.  **Review Technical Documentation:**\n    *   \nLocate the \"Technical Documents\" or \"Developer\" section on the YiPay website. This will contain the most up\n-to-date information on their API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.\n\n3.  **Integration with\n `one-api`:**\n    *   The term \"one-api\" can be generic. If you are\n referring to a unified payment API, you will need to map the specific requirements of that API to YiPay's API.\n\n    *   **Authentication:** Use your API Key to authenticate your requests. This is typically done by including the key in\n the request headers.\n    *   **Create a Payment Request:** To initiate a payment, you will need to send\n a request to YiPay's payment endpoint with the following parameters:\n        *   `merchant_id`: Your\n YiPay Merchant ID.\n        *   `amount`: The transaction amount.\n        *   `order_id\n`: A unique identifier for the transaction.\n        *   `notify_url`: The URL where YiPay will send\n a callback to notify you of the transaction status.\n        *   `return_url`: The URL where the user\n will be redirected after completing the payment.\n        *   `signature`: A signature generated by hashing the request parameters with\n your API Key to ensure the integrity of the data.\n    *   **Handle the Callback:** Your `notify_url` will\n receive a POST request from YiPay with the transaction status. You should validate the signature of the callback to ensure it is from Yi\nPay and then update the order status in your system.\n\n4.  **Integration with `new-api`:**\n\n    *   The term \"new-api\" suggests that YiPay may have a newer version of their API.\n It is important to check their documentation for the latest version.\n    *   **Modern Features:** Newer APIs often include\n features like:\n        *   **RESTful architecture:** Using standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and\n `DELETE`.\n        *   **JSON format:** For request and response payloads.\n        *   **OAuth \n2.0:** For more secure authentication.\n        *   **Webhooks:** For real-time notifications.\n\n    *   **Endpoint and Parameter Changes:** Be sure to check the documentation for any changes to the API endpoints and required parameters.\n\n\n### Potential Naming Confusion\n\nThe terms \"one-api\" and \"new-api\" can be ambiguous. It\n is possible that you are referring to a different payment platform or a specific product name. The search results indicated that other platforms\n like **Onepay** and **Paya Connect** also use similar terminology.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nFor the most\n accurate and up-to-date information, it is highly recommended to **contact YiPay directly**:\n\n*   **\nPhone:** +886-2-2776-6986\n*   **Email:**\n service@yipay.com.tw\n\nThey will be able to provide you with the specific documentation and support you need\n to integrate their services with `one-api` and `new-api` in 2026.","hint":"A good answer must recognize YiPay as a payment service/provider and outline a plausible integration approach with generic “one-api”/“new-api”-style gateways, including obtaining API credentials, configuring endpoints, handling callbacks/webhooks, and addressing security (e.g., signatures, HTTPS) and versioning, while acknowledging the likely lack of specific 2026 official documentation and suggesting using the latest YiPay/gateway docs or SDKs instead.[[1]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?","timestamp":64145},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":64145},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377359738-7c0e13a6394b98","status":"completed","timestamp":64145},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377359743-f31e495a73d7f8","status":"completed","timestamp":64145},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377380096-b66d8872fb2a7","status":"completed","timestamp":64145},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377380106-e28d034ffdc1e","status":"completed","timestamp":64145},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377380141-80f469a82991b8","status":"completed","timestamp":64145},{"type":"message","content":"Integrating YiPay with ","timestamp":64145},{"type":"message","content":"`one-api` and `new-api` in 2026 requires following the official documentation provided by Yi","timestamp":64145},{"type":"message","content":"Pay.

There is no specific \"v1.2\" release with breaking changes mentioned, so the following\n guidance is based on the major v1.0 overhaul.\n\nHere’s a summary of the breaking changes and how to fix\n them:\n\n### 1. Unified Agent Interface\n*   **Change**: `VoicePipelineAgent` and `MultimodalAgent\n` are deprecated.\n*   **Fix**: Update your agents to use the `AgentSession` class, which now serves\n as the single, unified orchestrator for all agent types.\n\n### 2. Customizing Pipeline Behavior\n*   **Change\n**: The `before_llm_cb` and `before_tts_cb` callbacks have been removed.\n*   \n**Fix**: Use the new concept of `pipeline nodes` (`llm_node` and `tts_node`).\n This new approach provides more flexibility for custom processing within the pipeline steps.\n\n### 3. Tool Definition and Use\n*   **\nChange**: The method for defining tools for agents has been streamlined.\n*   **Fix**: You will need to ref\nactor how you define and register tools with your agents to align with the new, simplified API.\n\n### 4. Chat\n Context\n*   **Change**: The `ChatContext` API has been overhauled. Direct modification of `chat_ctx\n.messages` is no longer supported.\n*   **Fix**: Use the new `ChatContext` methods to manage chat\n history. This provides a more powerful and flexible way to handle context, especially when dealing with different LLM providers.\n\n\n### 5. Transcriptions\n*   **Change**: There are new changes to how transcriptions are handled.\n*   **\nFix**: Review the updated documentation for transcription handling in Agents v1.0 and adjust your implementation accordingly.\n\n### 6. Accepting\n Text Input\n*   **Change**: The `ChatManager` has been removed.\n*   **Fix**: No\n action is needed to accept text input. Agents now automatically receive text from a text stream on the `lk.chat` topic\n.\n\n### 7. State Change Events\n*   **Change**: The `user_started_speaking` and `user_\nstopped_speaking` events have been combined into a single `user_state_changed` event. Other agent events have also been\n overhauled.\n*   **Fix**: Update your event handlers to use the new `user_state_changed` event and review\n other event-related changes in the v1.0 release.\n\n### MCP Implementation\nWhile the search results did not detail\n specific breaking changes for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in a v1.2 release, the focus is on its\n native support in LiveKit agents. MCP allows your agents to self-discover and execute tools in real-time.

{"id":"websearch-1926","input":"What are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025?","output":"What are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025?\nAs of October 2025, the best practices for ETL data pipelines have evolved to handle larger data\n volumes, real-time processing needs, and increasing security demands. Here are the latest recommendations:\n\n### 1. Data Integrity\n and Governance\n- **Data Product Mindset**: Treat data pipelines as products that deliver business value, not just as technical infrastructure\n. This means focusing on data quality, reliability, and accessibility for end-users.\n- **Data Integrity**: Implement robust validation\n at every stage of the pipeline to ensure data is accurate, complete, and consistent. Tools like Great Expectations can be used\n for automated data profiling.\n- **Data Contracts**: Define and enforce data contracts to set clear expectations for data quality and\n schema, preventing data degradation and unexpected changes.\n\n### 2. Scalability and Performance\n- **Modular Architecture**: Design pipelines\n with loosely coupled, independent components for extraction, transformation, and loading. This allows for greater flexibility and easier maintenance.\n- **\nCloud-Native Solutions**: Leverage cloud platforms for auto-scaling and real-time adjustments to handle fluctuating workloads.\n- **\nIncremental Loading**: Process only new or updated data instead of full data reloads to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\n- **\nOptimized Processing**: Choose the right data processing model (batch, micro-batch, or streaming) based on the specific business\n requirements and latency tolerance.\n\n### 3. Orchestration, Monitoring, and Automation\n- **Intelligent Orchestration**:\n Use modern orchestration tools like Apache Airflow or Dagster to manage complex dependencies and create resilient workflows.\n- **Comprehensive\n Monitoring**: Implement real-time observability to track key metrics such as task duration, success rates, and data throughput. AI\n-driven monitoring can help identify and resolve bottlenecks proactively.\n- **Automated Maintenance**: Automate routine tasks like error handling,\n retries, and restarts to improve reliability and reduce manual intervention.\n\n### 4. Security\n- **End-to-End\n Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit throughout the entire pipeline.\n- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control\n (RBAC) and a zero-trust security model to ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to see\n.\n- **Sensitive Data Masking**: Mask or anonymize sensitive data fields to protect privacy and comply with regulations.\n\n### \n5. Modern Tooling\n- **Automated Data Connectors**: Use automated connectors to simplify data ingestion and reduce the manual\n effort required from data engineers.\n- **Low-Code/No-Code Platforms**: Adopt low-code or no-code solutions\n to accelerate development and empower non-technical users to build and manage data pipelines.","hint":"To earn full credit, an answer must identify that modern ETL best practices (as of late 2025) emphasize cloud-native, scalable architectures (often ELT-first and/or lakehouse/zero-ETL patterns), modular and orchestrated pipelines (e.g., with tools like Airflow/Dagster), support for both batch and streaming/CDC, strong data quality/observability and governance, automation (including AI-driven optimization where relevant), and software-engineering practices such as version control, testing, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code.

Prerequisites\n\n*   **HAProxy Server:** A server where HAProxy will be installed. This server should have a static IP address on your LAN (e.g.,\n `192.168.1.100`).\n*   **Existing SOCKS5 Proxy:** You will need an existing SOCKS5 proxy server running (e.g., on `127.0.\n0.1:9050` on the same HAProxy server, or a different server accessible from your HAProxy machine). HAProxy will forward traffic to this upstream SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n### 2. Configure HAProxy\n\n1.\n  **Install HAProxy:**\n    On a Debian/Ubuntu system:\n    \n```bash\n    sudo apt update\n    sudo apt install haproxy\n    ```\n\n    (Adjust for other operating systems if needed.)\n\n2.  \n**Edit HAProxy Configuration:**\n    Open the HAProxy configuration file, typically located at `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`.\n    \n```bash\n    sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg\n\n    \n```\n\n    Add or modify the following sections. Replace `192.168.1.100` with your HAProxy server's actual LAN IP address and `127.0.0\n.1:9050` with the IP and port of your existing SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n    \n```ini\n    global\n        log /dev/log    local0\n        chroot /var/lib/hap\nroxy\n        pidfile /var/run/haproxy.pid\n        maxconn 4000\n        user haproxy\n        group haproxy\n        daemon\n\n    defaults\n        log global\n\n        mode tcp\n        option tcplog\n        timeout connect 5000ms\n        timeout client 50000ms\n        timeout server 50000ms\n\n    frontend socks5_in\n\n        # Bind to an IP address accessible from your LAN\n        # Replace 192.168.1.100 with your server's actual LAN IP address.\n        # The port 1080\n is the standard SOCKS5 port.\n        bind 192.168.1.100:1080 name socks5_proxy\n        default_backend socks5_backend\n\n    backend socks\n5_backend\n        mode tcp\n        balance roundrobin\n        # Replace 127.0.0.1:9050 with the actual SOCKS5 server's IP and port\n        server s5_\nserver1 127.0.0.1:9050 check\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Check HAProxy Configuration and Restart:**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo haproxy -c -f /etc/\nhaproxy/haproxy.cfg\n    sudo systemctl restart haproxy\n    \n```\n\n\n### 3. Configure Firewall to Allow LAN Connections\n\nEnsure your server's firewall allows incoming connections to the HAProxy SOCKS5 port (\ne.g., 1080) from your LAN subnet.\nOn Linux with `ufw`:\n\n\n```bash\n# Allow connections from your LAN subnet (e.g., 192.168.1\n.0/24) to port 1080\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 1080 proto tcp\nsudo ufw enable #\n if ufw is not already enabled\nsudo ufw status # to verify the rule\n\n```\n\nReplace `192.168.1.0/24` with your actual LAN subnet.\n\n### 4.\n Configure Antidetect Browser\n\n1.  **Open Browser Profile Settings:** In your antidetect browser (e.g., Dolphin Anty, Multilogin), go to the settings for the specific browser profile you intend to use.\n\n2.  **Locate Proxy Settings:** Find the section dedicated to proxy configuration.\n3.  **Select SOCKS5:** Choose `SOCKS5` as the proxy type.\n4.  **Enter Proxy Details:**\n    \n*   **Proxy Host/IP:** Enter the LAN IP address of your HAProxy server (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).\n    *   **Proxy Port:** Enter the\n port you configured in HAProxy (e.g., `1080`).\n5.  **Authentication (if applicable):** If your *upstream* SOCKS5 proxy (the one HAProxy is forwarding to) requires authentication, enter the\n username and password in the antidetect browser's proxy settings. HAProxy in this configuration does not handle SOCKS5 authentication itself.\n6.  **Test Connection:** Use the \"Test Proxy\" or \"Check Connection\" feature\n within your antidetect browser to verify that the connection is successful.\n\n### 5. Security Considerations\n\n*   **Firewall Rules:** Strictly limit firewall access to your HAProxy SOCKS5 port only to your trusted LAN subnet. Do\n not expose it to the public internet without robust security measures.\n*   **Upstream SOCKS5 Proxy Security:** Ensure your underlying SOCKS5 proxy is secure and, if exposed, requires strong authentication.\n*   **HAProxy Updates\n:** Keep your HAProxy installation updated.\n*   **Logging:** Monitor HAProxy logs for suspicious activity.\n\nThis setup uses HAProxy to act as a front-end for an existing SOCKS5 proxy, making it accessible from your\n LAN. For a true native SOCKS5 implementation with HAProxy, advanced Lua scripting would be required.","hint":"The answer must explain that you enable “Allow connections from LAN” in the HAPP (or Happ) proxy settings, obtain or configure a SOCKS5 proxy port/IP from HAPP, and then enter that SOCKS5 proxy (host, port, and any authentication) into the antidetect browser’s proxy/profile settings so the browser’s traffic is routed through the HAPP SOCKS5 proxy.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026","timestamp":32283},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":32283},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770377410849-6a42aa48a08318","status":"completed","timestamp":32283},{"type":"message","content":"To set up an HAProxy instance that allows connections from your LAN and forwards to an existing SOCKS5 proxy for use with an","timestamp":32283},{"type":"message","content":" antidetect browser, follow these steps:\n\n### 1.
