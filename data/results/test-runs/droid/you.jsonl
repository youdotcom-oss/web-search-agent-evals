Import AsyncStorage:**\n```javascript\nimport AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';\n```\n\n**2. Storing Data:**\n```javascript\nconst storeData = async (key, value) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle saving error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**3. Retrieving Data:**\n```javascript\nconst getData = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);\n    if (value !== null) {\n      // Value was found\n      return value;\n    }\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error retrieving data\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**4. Storing JSON Objects:**\n```javascript\nconst storeObject = async (key, object) => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = JSON.stringify(object);\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, jsonValue);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle saving error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**5. Retrieving JSON Objects:**\n```javascript\nconst getObject = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);\n    return jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : null;\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**6. Removing Data:**\n```javascript\nconst removeItem = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.removeItem(key);\n  } catch (e) {\n    // Handle removing error\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Not for Sensitive Data**: AsyncStorage is **not encrypted by default**. Do not store sensitive information like passwords, tokens, or credit card details. For sensitive data, use **Expo SecureStore** or **react-native-keychain** instead.\n\n2. **Storage Size**: You can adjust the total storage size by setting an `AsyncStorage_db_size_in_MB` flag, but be mindful of device memory limits.\n\n3. **SDK 54 Compatibility**: According to the Reddit discussion about Expo SDK 54, the compatible version is `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (the specific version will be managed by Expo when you use `npx expo install`).\n\n4. **DOM Components Caveat**: If using `'use dom'` directive in Expo, be aware that AsyncStorage in DOM components uses HTML5 local storage in the webview, while native components use native local storage - they don't share data.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\"\nHow to store data locally using AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54 according to 2026 documentation?","timestamp":16727},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":16727},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019kiAJVR4zAacNBM3bzccEb","status":"completed","timestamp":16727},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information on how to store data locally using AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54.\n\n## How to Store Data Locally Using AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54\n\n### Installation\n\nFor Expo SDK 54, install AsyncStorage using:\n\n```bash\nnpx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n**1.

the traditional **TOML** format and the newer **JSON/JSONC** format (recommended since Wrangler v3.91.0):\n\n### Option 1: wrangler.toml (TOML format)\n\n```toml\nname = \"my-rust-worker\"\ncompatibility_date = \"2026-01-29\"\n\n[build]\ncommand = \"cargo install -q worker-build && worker-build --release\"\n\n[build.upload]\ndir = \"build/worker\"\nformat = \"modules\"\nmain = \"./shim.mjs\"\n\n[[build.upload.rules]]\nglobs = [\"**/*.wasm\"]\ntype = \"CompiledWasm\"\n```\n\n### Option 2: wrangler.jsonc (Recommended for 2025+)\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-rust-worker\",\n  \"main\": \"build/worker/shim.mjs\",\n  \"build\": {\n    \"command\": \"cargo install -q worker-build && worker-build --release\"\n  },\n  \"compatibility_date\": \"2026-01-29\"\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Main entry point**: For workers-rs, the main entry point is `./shim.mjs` (located in `build/worker/`) - this is a JavaScript shim generated by `worker-build` that properly invokes the compiled Wasm module via wasm-bindgen's JavaScript API.\n\n2. **Build command**: Uses `worker-build --release` which:\n   - Compiles your Rust code to WebAssembly\n   - Creates the JavaScript entrypoint script (`shim.mjs`)\n   - Invokes webpack to bundle the JavaScript\n\n3. **Format**: Uses `\"modules\"` format for ES modules support\n\nThe official template is at: https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\"\nCan you show me a github example of a workers-rs wrangler.toml main entry point for 2026?","timestamp":30401},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":30401},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LUffEDmMRmghoAmh4i6aAJ","status":"completed","timestamp":30401},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01JY6szYtaHmJtj4oxQzDZq5","status":"completed","timestamp":30401},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the actual wrangler.toml content from the official workers-rs template:","timestamp":30401},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":30401},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Q4sNTXqLxjGmQAu8Ybqsxf","status":"completed","timestamp":30401},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for more recent examples of workers-rs wrangler.toml configuration for 2025/2026:","timestamp":30401},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011axvHfjPH6uny3qqhZ2r7t","status":"completed","timestamp":30401},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's an example of a **workers-rs wrangler.toml** configuration with the main entry point for 2026:\n\n## workers-rs wrangler.toml Example (2026)\n\nThere are two approaches -
