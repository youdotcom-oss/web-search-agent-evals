Below is the current (latest‑docs) view of memory/state management and RAG context injection.\n\n**LangGraph memory/state management (current docs)**\n- State is persisted via **checkpointers**, which save a **checkpoint** of the graph state at every super‑step into a **thread**; this enables retrieval of current/historical state and underpins memory, human‑in‑the‑loop, and fault‑tolerance. Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence  \n- You must provide a `thread_id` when invoking a graph with persistence so the checkpointer can store and reload state across runs. Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence  \n- “Memory” in LangGraph is split into **short‑term** (state, per thread) and **long‑term** (store, across sessions). Short‑term is added by compiling with a checkpointer; long‑term uses a persistent store. Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory  \n- Durable execution uses the persistence layer and checkpointers so runs can resume after interrupts; non‑deterministic/side‑effecting work should be wrapped in tasks for consistent replay. Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution  \n\n**RAG context injection (current docs)**\n- The LangChain RAG tutorial explicitly **retrieves context** (via a tool) and **serializes retrieved docs** to pass to the model, which is the core context‑injection step in RAG (retrieval → prompt/context → generation). Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/rag  \n- LangChain’s **context engineering** guidance frames context as static runtime context (passed via `context` at invocation), dynamic runtime context (state), and cross‑conversation context (store). For RAG, retrieved chunks typically become dynamic runtime context passed into prompts or tools.

Source: FreeFrontend radial‑gradient examples (Jan 2026) `https://freefrontend.com/css-radial-gradient/`  \n- Recent `background-clip` examples emphasize animated/hover effects and CSS variables for gradient control (including text shimmer/hover transitions). Source: FreeFrontend background‑clip examples (Jan 2026) `https://freefrontend.com/css-background-clip-examples/`\n\n**How people combine these in 2026**  \nUse a layered background: a base gradient for the text fill plus a radial gradient overlay on hover. The text uses `background-clip: text`, and the radial gradient either centers on the element or follows the cursor via CSS variables (set from JS or `pointermove`).\n\n```css\n.title {\n  background-image:\n    linear-gradient(110deg, #7dd3fc 0%, #a78bfa 45%, #f472b6 100%),\n    radial-gradient(circle at var(--mx, 50%) var(--my, 50%),\n      rgba(255,255,255,0.45) 0%,\n      rgba(255,255,255,0.0) 55%);\n  background-size: 140% 140%, 200% 200%;\n  background-position: 0% 50%, center;\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n  background-clip: text;\n  color: transparent;\n  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;\n  transition: background-position 0.4s ease, background-size 0.4s ease;\n}\n\n.title:hover {\n  background-position: 100% 50%, center;\n  background-size: 140% 140%, 260% 260%;\n}\n```\n\nIf you want the overlay to follow the cursor (like the 2026 hover cards), update `--mx`/`--my` with pointer coordinates on `mousemove` and use those to position the radial gradient.\n\nIf you want me to pull a specific 2026 example and translate it into a concrete text‑hover snippet, say which effect (e.g., Evervault-style spotlight, Stripe-style glow) and I’ll map it directly.","timestamp":89367}],"metadata":{"category":"Documentation","subcategory":"CSS","lang":"CSS","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769463761057,"end":1769463850424,"firstResponse":89367,"sessionCreation":0,"total":89367},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":false,"score":0.6,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

{"id":"websearch-1806","input":"<web-search>Find current information about: libp2p rust relay client behaviour dial through relay API 2026</web-search>","output":"Here’s the most current, concrete info I found on Rust libp2p relay client behavior and dialing through a relay (as of the 2026 docs.rs build).\n\n- Rust libp2p exposes relay client support as a pair: `relay::client::new(local_peer_id)` returns `(Transport, Behaviour)`. The `Behaviour` is the `NetworkBehaviour` implementation for circuit relay v2 client functionality, and the `Transport` is the relay-capable transport you combine with your real transport. Source: https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/fn.new.html and https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/struct.Behaviour.html  \n- The relay client `Transport` only handles relayed `Multiaddr`s; it depends on another transport for actual data transfer and must be composed via `OrTransport`. It explicitly supports dialing and listening on `/p2p-circuit` addresses (examples show: `/p2p/<relay>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<dest>` for dialing; `/p2p/<relay>/p2p-circuit` for listening). Source: https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/struct.Transport.html  \n- Circuit relay v2 semantics (protocol behavior) are defined in the libp2p specs: the relay protocol is split into `hop` and `stop`. The client reserves a slot via `hop` (`RESERVE`), then a third party dials through the relay by opening a `hop` stream to the relay and requesting `CONNECT` to the destination. The relay opens a `stop` stream to the destination, and if it gets `STATUS:OK`, it bridges the two streams.

The `Behaviour` is the `NetworkBehaviour` implementation for circuit relay v2 client functionality, and the `Transport` is the relay-capable transport you combine with your real transport. Source: https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/fn.new.html and https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/struct.Behaviour.html  \n- The relay client `Transport` only handles relayed `Multiaddr`s; it depends on another transport for actual data transfer and must be composed via `OrTransport`. It explicitly supports dialing and listening on `/p2p-circuit` addresses (examples show: `/p2p/<relay>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<dest>` for dialing; `/p2p/<relay>/p2p-circuit` for listening). Source: https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/struct.Transport.html  \n- Circuit relay v2 semantics (protocol behavior) are defined in the libp2p specs: the relay protocol is split into `hop` and `stop`. The client reserves a slot via `hop` (`RESERVE`), then a third party dials through the relay by opening a `hop` stream to the relay and requesting `CONNECT` to the destination. The relay opens a `stop` stream to the destination, and if it gets `STATUS:OK`, it bridges the two streams. The dialer is expected to use a circuit multiaddr of the form `/p2p/<relay>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<dest>`.

Source: `https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/blob/master/docs/guides/configuration/ignores.md`\n- Workspace‑scoped ignores: add `ws:<name>` and run with `--workspaces` to only honor exceptions in specific environments (e.g., dev vs prod).
