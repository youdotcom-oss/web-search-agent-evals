However, it doesn't address other installation methods or provide more details about 'container-use' in the context of Dagger, which affects the completeness score.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":false,"mcpToolCalled":false,"deterministicScore":60,"llmScore":35,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false}}}

Create\n a file named `App.tsx` in the `src` directory and paste the TypeScript code above.\n3.  \nCreate a file named `App.css` in the `src` directory and paste the CSS code above.\n4\n.  Ensure that your `main.tsx` (or `index.tsx`) is rendering the `App` component.\n\nAfter\n completing these steps, you can run your application, and you should see a search input with a \"clear\" button that appears when you\n type in the input.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: best icon libraries 2024 2025 Font Awesome Material Icons free CDN</web-search>","timestamp":47394},{"type":"message","content":"I will add a \"clear\" button to the search input.

Set the\n Multiprocessing Start Method to `spawn`\n\nThe most frequent cause of deadlocks, especially when using GPUs, is\n the default `fork` start method on Unix-like systems. Using `fork` can lead to issues with shared resources\n and CUDA contexts. The `spawn` method starts a fresh process, which avoids these problems.\n\n**Solution:** Set\n the start method to `spawn` at the beginning of your main script.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as\n mp\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n\n    # Your multiprocessing code here\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Initialize Models Inside Child Processes\n\nAvoid initializing your model or\n moving it to a GPU in the main process. Each child process should initialize its own model and move it to its designated\n GPU.\n\n**Incorrect:**\n\n\n```python\n# DON'T DO THIS\nmodel = MyModel().cuda()\n# Then\n spawn processes\n\n```\n\n\n**Correct:**\n\n\n```python\ndef worker_function(rank, model_path):\n\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.load_state_\ndict(torch.load(model_path))\n    model.to(rank)\n    # ... rest of your\n worker logic\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Use `model.share_memory_()` for CPU-based Models\n\nIf\n you are working with CPU-based models, you can use `model.share_memory_()` to share the model'\ns parameters between processes without creating copies.\n\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start\n_method('spawn', force=True)\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.share_memory_\n()\n    # ... spawn processes that use the model\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. `DataLoader` Considerations\n\nIf\n you are using `DataLoader` with `num_workers > 0`, be aware that it uses multiprocessing internally.\n\n\n*   **Set `spawn`**: Ensure you have set the start method to `spawn`.\n*   **`num_\nworkers`**: Do not set `num_workers` to an excessively high value. A good starting point is the number of CPU cores\n.\n*   **Avoid `torch.set_num_threads`**: Do not set `torch.set_num\n_threads()` inside `DataLoader` workers.\n\n### 5. Use `torch.multiprocessing.Queue`\n\n\nFor inter-process communication, especially when passing tensors, use `torch.multiprocessing.Queue`. It is optimized\n for sharing tensors between processes.\n\n### 6. Consider `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP)\n\nFor multi\n-GPU or multi-node training, `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) is\n the recommended approach. It is more robust and performant than manual multiprocessing for training.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: PyTorch model loading multiprocessing stuck deadlock solution 2026</web-search>","timestamp":35030},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":35030},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769458291322-46f25f8603cf4","status":"completed","timestamp":35030},{"type":"message","content":"Deadlocks when loading PyTorch models with multiprocessing are a common issue.","timestamp":35030},{"type":"message","content":" Here is a summary of the most effective solutions and best practices to avoid this problem.\n\n### 1.

This method combines several advanced evasion tactics to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, making it difficult to\n detect.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how these components work together:\n\n*   **`LoadLibraryEx\n` and DLL Injection**: `LoadLibraryEx` is a Windows API function that loads a specified library (a DLL file) into the\n address space of the calling process. In the context of malware, this function is often used for DLL injection. The attacker forces\n a legitimate process to load a malicious DLL, thereby executing the malware's code within the trusted context of that process.\n\n*\n   **Decoy DLL and DLL Hollowing (Module Stomping)**: To evade detection, malware authors use a\n technique called DLL hollowing. Instead of injecting a suspicious-looking DLL, they first load a legitimate, benign DLL into the target process\n. This legitimate DLL acts as a \"decoy.\" Once the decoy DLL is loaded, the attacker hollows it out by\n overwriting its code in memory with the malicious payload. This makes the attack much stealthier, as security software is less likely to flag\n the loading of a known-good DLL.\n\n*   **Process Hollowing and Memory Injection**: Process hollowing is a broader\n technique where an attacker creates a new, legitimate process in a suspended state. They then unmap (hollow out) the\n original, legitimate code from the process's memory and replace it with their malicious code. The process is then resumed, and the malicious\n code runs under the guise of the legitimate process. DLL hollowing is a specific form of this, targeting a module within the\n process rather than the entire process.\n\n**How it all comes together in 2024:**\n\nThis combination of\n techniques creates a highly evasive attack chain. In 2024, malware, particularly loaders like HijackLoader\n, has been observed using these methods extensively. The general flow of the attack is as follows:\n\n1.  A\n legitimate process is created or hijacked.\n2.  A legitimate DLL is loaded into the process to act as a decoy\n.\n3.  The memory space of the decoy DLL is hollowed out and overwritten with malicious code.\n4\n.  The legitimate process, now containing the malicious code in the hollowed-out DLL, continues execution.\n\nRecent\n developments in Windows 11 (specifically the 24H2 update) have made traditional process hollowing more difficult\n. In response, attackers are developing new techniques like \"transacted hollowing\" and \"ghostly hollowing\" to adapt\n to these changes and maintain their stealth.

It should be kept\n up-to-date and explain the reasoning behind pipeline logic.\n*   **Standardization:** Implement and enforce consistent naming\n conventions, data quality checks, and transformation layers to avoid custom, hard-to-maintain pipelines.\n\n### **2. Data Quality\n and Validation:**\n*   **Proactive Data Validation:** Implement checks for data type, schema, freshness, and null\nability *before* data enters your pipeline.\n*   **Data Integrity:** Enforce data quality rules throughout your pipeline\n and allow for human intervention to resolve complex issues.\n\n### **3. Observability and Monitoring:**\n*   **Comprehensive Logging:**\n Log all changes to your data, including what changed, when, why, and by whom.\n*   **S\nymptom-Based Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify you of issues like stale data, not just pipeline failures.\n*\n   **Real-Time Observability:** Monitor your pipelines at every stage, tracking key metrics like task duration, success rates, and\n throughput.\n\n### **4. Robustness and Reliability:**\n*   **Treat SQL as Code:** Apply software engineering best\n practices to your SQL, including version control, code reviews, and testing.\n*   **Master Orchestration:** Design\n clear task boundaries, use event-driven triggers, and implement retries with backoff.\n*   **Idempotent\n Design:** Ensure that re-running your pipelines produces the same results, which is crucial for reliability and debugging.\n\n### **5.\n Scalability and Future-Proofing:**\n*   **Build for the Future:** Design your pipelines with a long-term\n perspective, considering data growth and potential technical debt.\n*   **Incremental Loading:** Process only new or changed data to improve efficiency and\n reduce costs.\n*   **Modular Pipelines:** Break down your pipelines into reusable components to improve maintainability.\n\n### **6\n. Cost Management and Security:**\n*   **Diligent Cost Monitoring:** Actively manage your cloud costs by optimizing queries\n, partitioning data, and removing unused resources.\n*   **Prioritize Security:** Implement encryption, data masking, and role\n-based access control to protect sensitive data.\n\n### **7.
