When you publish a container port (e.g., `-p 8080:80`), Docker makes it accessible externally even if UFW is configured to deny incoming traffic.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions (from most recommended to alternative)\n\n### 1. **Bind Ports to localhost Only** (Simplest & Most Effective)\n\nInstead of exposing ports publicly, bind them to `127.0.0.1`:\n\n```bash\n# Command line\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 myapp\n\n# docker-compose.yml\nports:\n  - \"127.0.0.1:8080:80\"\n```\n\nThen use a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) on the host to handle external traffic through ports 80/443, which UFW can control.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Use the `ufw-docker` Script** (Recommended for Managing Multiple Containers)\n\nInstall the script that integrates UFW with Docker's `DOCKER-USER` chain:\n\n```bash\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\nsudo ufw-docker install\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n```\n\nThen manage container access:\n```bash\n# Allow external access to a specific container port\nsudo ufw-docker allow mycontainer 80/tcp\n\n# Deny access\nsudo ufw-docker delete allow mycontainer 80/tcp\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Modify `/etc/ufw/after.rules`** (Manual Method)\n\nAdd rules to filter Docker traffic through UFW.

Here are the steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n### 1. **Update the Droid CLI Manually**\nIf auto-update fails, reinstall the CLI:\n\n**macOS/Linux:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://app.factory.ai/cli | sh\n```\n\n**Windows:**\nDownload the latest installer from the Factory app website.\n\n### 2. **Check Authentication**\nEnsure your API key is valid and properly configured:\n```bash\nexport FACTORY_API_KEY=fk-...\n```\nOr re-authenticate using:\n```\n/login\n```\n\n### 3. **Verify Network Connectivity**\n- Check that you can reach `app.factory.ai`\n- Ensure no firewall or proxy is blocking the connection\n\n### 4. **For Custom Droid Update Failures**\nIf the error is related to updating custom droids (`.factory/droids/` files):\n\n- **Validate YAML frontmatter** - Ensure the droid file has valid YAML with required fields:\n  - `name` (required): lowercase letters, digits, `-`, `_`\n  - `description` (optional): ≤500 characters\n  - `model`: Use `inherit` or a valid model ID\n  - `tools`: Use a category (`read-only`, `edit`, `execute`, `web`) or explicit tool array\n\n- **Check for invalid tools** - Unknown tool names cause validation errors. Valid tools include: `Read`, `LS`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Create`, `Edit`, `ApplyPatch`, `Execute`, `WebSearch`, `FetchUrl`\n\n- **Reload droids** - Use `/droids` command and select \"Reload\" to refresh the droid list\n\n### 5. **Check CLI Logs**\nReview logs for specific error messages:\n- Validation issues appear in CLI logs when a droid file fails to load\n- Use the `/bug` command to create a bug report with session data and logs\n\n### 6. **Reset Factory Settings**\nIf issues persist:\n- Settings are stored in `~/.factory/`\n- Check `settings.json` for corruption (atomic writes should prevent this)\n- Try clearing cached data\n\n### 7. **Windows-Specific Fixes**\n- Windows auto-updates use a deferred strategy - restart the CLI to apply updates\n- Check for EPERM permission errors on file operations\n\n### 8. **Check Version**\nVerify your CLI version:\n```bash\ndroid -v\n```\nThe latest version (as of January 2026) is around v0.56.0.\n\n### 9. **Contact Support**\nIf the issue persists:\n- Use `/bug [title]` to submit a bug report\n- Join the Factory Discord community for additional help\n- Check GitHub discussions at github.com/Factory-AI/factory","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to fix droid update failed error in factory.ai documentation 2026","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01S5xkSTHFkbDxeRUHtriySy","status":"completed","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01TqEDnDyLEGf9U4kA3gjet1","status":"completed","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016F6uX69Zb9kggDp1nauLF3","status":"completed","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015h3PeVVXLTcJfUhgPZgQzv","status":"completed","timestamp":60012},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about the \"droid update failed\" error in Factory.ai documentation.","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MdWVNCE4jDDyvfC9Xb4VXw","status":"completed","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015enADH3Thm6oy1zU3Mibjg","status":"completed","timestamp":60012},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Fb813h41bJxBxNzsmXfyx8","status":"completed","timestamp":60012},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research of the Factory.ai documentation, I can provide you with guidance on how to fix the \"droid update failed\" error.\n\n## How to Fix \"Droid Update Failed\" Error in Factory.ai\n\nThe \"droid update failed\" error typically occurs when there are issues with updating the Droid CLI or custom droids.

It's thrown when you attempt to bridge/transfer assets to the **same blockchain network** you're currently on - which is logically invalid for a cross-chain bridge operation.\n\n### How to Fix It\n\n#### 1. **Ensure Different Source and Destination Chain IDs**\n\nWhen calling LiFi bridge functions, verify that `fromChainId` (source) and `toChainId` (destination) are different:\n\n```solidity\n// WRONG - will trigger CannotBridgeToSameNetwork\nuint256 fromChainId = 1;  // Ethereum Mainnet\nuint256 toChainId = 1;    // Same network!\n\n// CORRECT\nuint256 fromChainId = 1;     // Ethereum Mainnet\nuint256 toChainId = 42161;   // Arbitrum\n```\n\n#### 2. **Check Your BridgeData Struct**\n\nLiFi facets use a `BridgeData` struct in `ILiFi.sol`. Ensure the `destinationChainId` differs from the current chain:\n\n```solidity\nILiFi.BridgeData memory bridgeData = ILiFi.BridgeData({\n    transactionId: keccak256(\"myTx\"),\n    bridge: \"stargate\",\n    integrator: \"myApp\",\n    referrer: address(0),\n    sendingAssetId: tokenAddress,\n    receiver: receiverAddress,\n    minAmount: amount,\n    destinationChainId: 42161,  // Must be different from block.chainid\n    hasSourceSwaps: false,\n    hasDestinationCall: false\n});\n\n// Add validation before calling\nrequire(bridgeData.destinationChainId != block.chainid, \"Cannot bridge to same network\");\n```\n\n#### 3. **Validate Before Calling LiFi Contracts**\n\nAdd pre-flight checks in your integration:\n\n```solidity\nfunction bridgeTokens(\n    uint256 destinationChainId,\n    address token,\n    uint256 amount,\n    address receiver\n) external {\n    // Validate destination chain is different\n    if (destinationChainId == block.chainid) {\n        revert(\"Use swap instead of bridge for same-chain transfers\");\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with LiFi bridge call...\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Use Swaps for Same-Chain Operations**\n\nIf you need to transfer/swap tokens on the same chain, use LiFi's **swap functionality** instead of bridge:\n\n```solidity\n// For same-chain: use swapTokensGeneric() or similar swap functions\n// For cross-chain: use bridge facets (StargateFacet, AcrossFacet, etc.)\n```\n\n#### 5. **SDK/API Integration Fix**\n\nWhen using LiFi's SDK or API, ensure your request specifies different chains:\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript/TypeScript SDK example\nconst quote = await lifi.getQuote({\n    fromChain: 1,        // Ethereum\n    toChain: 10,         // Optimism (must be different!)\n    fromToken: '0x...',\n    toToken: '0x...',\n    fromAmount: '1000000000000000000',\n    fromAddress: userAddress\n});\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n| Scenario | Solution |\n|----------|----------|\n| Same source/destination chain IDs | Change `toChainId` to a different network |\n| Same-chain token operations needed | Use swap functions instead of bridge facets |\n| SDK integration error | Verify `fromChain` ≠ `toChain` in your API request |\n| Dynamic chain detection | Compare `block.chainid` with destination before calling |\n\nThe error is intentional protection to prevent invalid bridging operations.

Always use `spawn` start method\n2. Load models **inside** worker processes, not in the main process\n3. Use `torch.multiprocessing` instead of standard `multiprocessing`\n4.

This means users must add your web app to their home screen before they can receive push notifications.\n\n---\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. **iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or later**\n2. **HTTPS** - Your site must be served over a secure connection\n3. **Web App Manifest** (`manifest.json`)\n4. **Service Worker** registration\n5. **User interaction** to trigger permission prompt (cannot auto-prompt)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Web Application Manifest\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file in your website's root directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"AppName\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: The `display` property **must** be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` for push notifications to work on iOS.\n\nLink the manifest in your HTML `<head>`:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Generate VAPID Keys\n\nVAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys are required for sending push notifications without proprietary registration.\n\nGenerate keys using OpenSSL:\n\n```bash\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out private_key.pem\nopenssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 65 | base64 | tr -d '=' | tr '/+' '_-' > public_key.txt\nopenssl ec -in private_key.pem -outform DER | tail -c +8 | head -c 32 | base64 | tr -d '=' | tr '/+' '_-' > private_key.txt\n```\n\nOr use a library like `web-push` (Node.js):\n\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Create and Register a Service Worker\n\nCreate `sw.js` (service worker) in your root directory:\n\n```javascript\n// sw.js - Service Worker for handling push notifications\n\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  if (!event.data) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const data = event.data.json();\n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || 'You have a new notification',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: data.badge || '/icons/badge-72x72.png',\n    vibrate: [100, 50, 100],\n    data: {\n      url: data.url || '/'\n    }\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data.title || 'Notification', options)\n  );\n});\n\n// Handle notification click\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.matchAll({ type: 'window', includeUncontrolled: true }).then(function(clientList) {\n      const url = event.notification.data.url;\n      \n      // Check if there's already a window open\n      for (let i = 0; i < clientList.length; i++) {\n        const client = clientList[i];\n        if (client.url === url && 'focus' in client) {\n          return client.focus();\n        }\n      }\n      \n      // Open new window if none exists\n      if (clients.openWindow) {\n        return clients.openWindow(url);\n      }\n    })\n  );\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Implement the JavaScript Registration\n\n**Critical for iOS**: The push permission prompt **must be triggered by a user gesture** (e.g., button click). You cannot auto-prompt on page load.\n\n```javascript\n// main.js - Client-side push notification setup\n\nconst VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';\n\n// Convert VAPID key for use with PushManager\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n\n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\n// Check if push notifications are supported\nfunction isPushSupported() {\n  return 'serviceWorker' in navigator && \n         'PushManager' in window && \n         'Notification' in window;\n}\n\n// Check if running as installed PWA (standalone mode)\nfunction isStandalone() {\n  return window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches ||\n         window.navigator.standalone === true;\n}\n\n// Register service worker\nasync function registerServiceWorker() {\n  try {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');\n    console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    return registration;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Subscribe to push notifications - MUST be called from user gesture (onclick)\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  if (!isPushSupported()) {\n    alert('Push notifications are not supported in this browser');\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // For iOS Safari, must be in standalone mode (added to home screen)\n  if (/iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent) && !isStandalone()) {\n    alert('Please add this app to your Home Screen first to enable notifications');\n    return;\n  }\n\n  try {\n    // Register service worker first\n    const registration = await registerServiceWorker();\n    \n    // Wait for the service worker to be ready\n    await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n\n    // Request notification permission\n    const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n    \n    if (permission !== 'granted') {\n      console.log('Notification permission denied');\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Subscribe to push\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY)\n    });\n\n    console.log('Push subscription:', JSON.stringify(subscription));\n\n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n    \n    alert('Successfully subscribed to push notifications!');\n\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to subscribe to push:', error);\n    alert('Failed to enable notifications: ' + error.message);\n  }\n}\n\n// Send subscription data to your backend\nasync function sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription) {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/push/subscribe', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(subscription)\n  });\n  \n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error('Failed to save subscription on server');\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach to button click - REQUIRED for iOS\ndocument.getElementById('enableNotifications').addEventListener('click', subscribeToPush);\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Create the Enable Notifications UI\n\n```html\n<!-- Add a visible button for users to enable notifications -->\n<button id=\"enableNotifications\" class=\"notification-btn\">\n  🔔 Enable Notifications\n</button>\n\n<!-- Optionally show instructions for iOS users -->\n<div id=\"iosInstructions\" style=\"display: none;\">\n  <p>To receive notifications on iOS:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Tap the <strong>Share</strong> button in Safari</li>\n    <li>Select <strong>\"Add to Home Screen\"</strong></li>\n    <li>Open the app from your Home Screen</li>\n    <li>Tap \"Enable Notifications\"</li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  // Show iOS instructions if needed\n  if (/iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent) && \n      !window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {\n    document.getElementById('iosInstructions').style.display = 'block';\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Backend - Send Push Notifications\n\nExample using Node.js with the `web-push` library:\n\n```javascript\n// server.js\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\n// Configure VAPID\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  process.env.VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY,\n  process.env.VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY\n);\n\n// Store subscriptions (use a database in production)\nconst subscriptions = [];\n\n// Endpoint to save subscriptions\napp.post('/api/push/subscribe', (req, res) => {\n  const subscription = req.body;\n  subscriptions.push(subscription);\n  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Subscription saved' });\n});\n\n// Send notification to all subscribers\nasync function sendPushNotification(title, body, url) {\n  const payload = JSON.stringify({\n    title: title,\n    body: body,\n    url: url,\n    icon: '/icons/icon-192x192.png'\n  });\n\n  const options = {\n    TTL: 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours\n  };\n\n  for (const subscription of subscriptions) {\n    try {\n      await webpush.sendNotification(subscription, payload, options);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Error sending notification:', error);\n      // Remove invalid subscriptions\n      if (error.statusCode === 410) {\n        const index = subscriptions.indexOf(subscription);\n        subscriptions.splice(index, 1);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points for iOS Safari\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|------------|---------|\n| **Manifest display** | Must be `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` |\n| **Add to Home Screen** | Users MUST install the PWA first |\n| **User gesture** | Permission prompt requires button click |\n| **HTTPS** | Required for service workers |\n| **Service Worker** | Must be at root or same scope |\n\n---\n\n### Testing Checklist\n\n1. ✅ Manifest is valid and linked correctly\n2. ✅ Service worker registers without errors\n3. ✅ Site is served over HTTPS\n4. ✅ User adds app to Home Screen\n5. ✅ App opens in standalone mode (no Safari UI)\n6. ✅ User taps button to enable notifications\n7. ✅ Permission prompt appears\n8. ✅ Subscription is sent to server\n9. ✅ Push notifications are received\n\n---\n\nThis setup enables web push notifications for iOS Safari 16.4+ when users add your PWA to their Home Screen. The key difference from desktop browsers is that iOS **requires** the app to be installed and opened from the Home Screen—notifications won't work from the regular Safari browser.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":56842},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":56842},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01M5boaFhN2yvo83xKmuJc5f","status":"completed","timestamp":56842},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to set up web push notifications for Safari on iOS 16.4+ using the Add to Home Screen Push API**:\n\n---\n\n## Web Push Notifications for Safari iOS 16.4+ Setup Guide\n\n### Overview\nStarting with iOS 16.4, Apple supports **Web Push notifications** on Safari, but **only for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that are installed to the Home Screen**.

However, there's a key requirement: **the website must be a Progressive Web App (PWA) installed on the user's home screen**.\n\n---\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. **iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or later** on the user's device\n2. **HTTPS** - Your site must be served over a secure connection\n3. **Web App Manifest** (`manifest.json`) with proper configuration\n4. **Service Worker** registered and active\n5. **User must add the PWA to their Home Screen**\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Create a Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file in your web root:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"AppName\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Critical**: The `display` property must be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` for push notifications to work.\n\nLink the manifest in your HTML `<head>`:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n#### 2. Generate VAPID Keys\n\nVAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys are required for web push. Generate them using OpenSSL or a library:\n\n**Using OpenSSL:**\n```bash\n# Generate private key\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out vapid_private.pem\n\n# Extract public key\nopenssl ec -in vapid_private.pem -pubout -out vapid_public.pem\n```\n\n**Using Node.js (web-push library):**\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\n#### 3. Create a Service Worker (`sw.js`)\n\nCreate a service worker file in your web root:\n\n```javascript\n// sw.js\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  if (event.data) {\n    const data = event.data.json();\n    const options = {\n      body: data.body,\n      icon: data.icon || '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n      badge: data.badge || '/icons/badge-72x72.png',\n      vibrate: [100, 50, 100],\n      data: {\n        url: data.url || '/'\n      }\n    };\n    \n    event.waitUntil(\n      self.registration.showNotification(data.title, options)\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow(event.notification.data.url)\n  );\n});\n```\n\n#### 4. Register Service Worker and Request Permission\n\n**Important**: The permission request MUST be triggered by a user gesture (click/tap).\n\n```javascript\n// main.js\nconst publicVapidKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY_HERE';\n\n// Check if service workers and push are supported\nfunction isPushSupported() {\n  return 'serviceWorker' in navigator && 'PushManager' in window;\n}\n\n// Check if running as installed PWA (standalone mode)\nfunction isInstalledPWA() {\n  return window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches ||\n         window.navigator.standalone === true;\n}\n\n// Register service worker\nasync function registerServiceWorker() {\n  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');\n  return registration;\n}\n\n// Subscribe to push notifications\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  try {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    \n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(publicVapidKey)\n    });\n    \n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await fetch('/api/subscribe', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: JSON.stringify(subscription),\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n      }\n    });\n    \n    console.log('Push subscription successful');\n    return subscription;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Push subscription failed:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Helper function to convert VAPID key\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n  \n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\n// Initialize - called on user interaction (button click)\nasync function enableNotifications() {\n  if (!isPushSupported()) {\n    alert('Push notifications are not supported in this browser');\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // Request notification permission\n  const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n  \n  if (permission === 'granted') {\n    await registerServiceWorker();\n    await subscribeToPush();\n    alert('Notifications enabled!');\n  } else {\n    alert('Notification permission denied');\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach to a button click event (REQUIRED - must be user-initiated)\ndocument.getElementById('enable-notifications-btn').addEventListener('click', enableNotifications);\n```\n\n#### 5. Backend: Store Subscriptions and Send Notifications\n\n**Node.js Example using `web-push` library:**\n\n```javascript\n// server.js\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Configure VAPID keys\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  process.env.VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY,\n  process.env.VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY\n);\n\n// Store subscriptions (use a database in production)\nconst subscriptions = [];\n\n// Endpoint to save subscription\napp.post('/api/subscribe', (req, res) => {\n  const subscription = req.body;\n  subscriptions.push(subscription);\n  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Subscription added' });\n});\n\n// Endpoint to send notification\napp.post('/api/send-notification', async (req, res) => {\n  const { title, body, url } = req.body;\n  \n  const payload = JSON.stringify({\n    title,\n    body,\n    url\n  });\n  \n  const sendPromises = subscriptions.map(subscription =>\n    webpush.sendNotification(subscription, payload)\n      .catch(error => console.error('Send failed:', error))\n  );\n  \n  await Promise.all(sendPromises);\n  res.json({ message: 'Notifications sent' });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\n---\n\n### User Instructions: Add to Home Screen\n\nUsers must add your PWA to their home screen. Guide them with these steps:\n\n1. **Open your website in Safari** on an iPhone/iPad running iOS 16.4+\n2. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow pointing up)\n3. **Scroll and tap \"Add to Home Screen\"**\n4. **Tap \"Add\"** to confirm\n5. **Open the app from the Home Screen**\n6. **Tap the \"Enable Notifications\" button** in your app\n\n---\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Create an \"Add to Home Screen\" banner** to guide iOS Safari users through the installation process\n\n2. **Only show the notification prompt after user interaction** - Safari blocks permission requests that aren't user-initiated\n\n3. **Detect iOS Safari users** and provide specific instructions:\n   ```javascript\n   function isIOSSafari() {\n     const ua = window.navigator.userAgent;\n     const iOS = !!ua.match(/iPad/i) || !!ua.match(/iPhone/i);\n     const webkit = !!ua.match(/WebKit/i);\n     return iOS && webkit && !ua.match(/CriOS/i);\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Check if already installed as PWA** before showing installation prompts:\n   ```javascript\n   if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {\n     // Running as installed PWA - can request notifications\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Handle the `beforeinstallprompt` event** (note: not supported on iOS, but useful for Android):\n   ```javascript\n   window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     // Save for later use\n   });\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Push notifications not appearing | Ensure the app is added to Home Screen and opened from there |\n| Permission prompt not showing | Must be triggered by user gesture (click/tap) |\n| Service worker not registering | Verify HTTPS and correct file path |\n| Notifications work on desktop but not iOS | iOS requires PWA installation to Home Screen |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nTo enable web push notifications on Safari iOS 16.4+:\n\n1. ✅ Create a valid `manifest.json` with `display: \"standalone\"`\n2. ✅ Implement a service worker with push event handlers\n3. ✅ Generate and configure VAPID keys\n4. ✅ Request permission only on user interaction\n5. ✅ Instruct users to add your site to their Home Screen\n6. ✅ Store push subscriptions on your server\n7. ✅ Send notifications using the Web Push protocol\n\nThis setup allows your web app to send push notifications to iOS users just like native apps, appearing on the lock screen, in Notification Center, and as banners.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":49764},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":49764},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RZBkGmhwxkzcCSFjnkPRyb","status":"completed","timestamp":49764},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on setting up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4+ using the Add to Home Screen Push API:\n\n---\n\n## Web Push Notifications on Safari iOS 16.4+ - Complete Setup Guide\n\n### Overview\n\nStarting with iOS 16.4 (released March 2023), Apple finally supports Web Push notifications on Safari for iPhones and iPads.

Register the Service Worker and Request Permission\n\nIn your main JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\n// Register Service Worker\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n\n// Function to request notification permission\n// MUST be called from a user gesture (click event)\nasync function requestNotificationPermission() {\n  // Check if notifications are supported\n  if (!('Notification' in window)) {\n    console.log('Notifications not supported');\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Check if running as installed PWA (standalone mode)\n  const isStandalone = window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches \n    || window.navigator.standalone;\n  \n  if (!isStandalone) {\n    // Prompt user to add to Home Screen first\n    alert('Please add this app to your Home Screen to enable notifications');\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Request permission\n  const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n  \n  if (permission === 'granted') {\n    console.log('Notification permission granted');\n    await subscribeToPush();\n    return true;\n  }\n  \n  return false;\n}\n\n// Subscribe to Push Notifications\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n  \n  const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n    userVisibleOnly: true,\n    applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array('YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY')\n  });\n\n  // Send subscription to your server\n  await fetch('/api/push/subscribe', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify(subscription)\n  });\n}\n\n// Helper function to convert VAPID key\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Create a User-Triggered Button\n\nThe permission request **MUST** be triggered by a user action:\n\n```html\n<button id=\"enable-notifications\" onclick=\"requestNotificationPermission()\">\n  Enable Notifications\n</button>\n```\n\n#### 6. Generate VAPID Keys (for server-side push)\n\nGenerate VAPID keys using OpenSSL or a library:\n\n```bash\n# Generate private key\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out private_key.pem\n\n# Generate public key\nopenssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 65 | base64 | tr '/+' '_-' | tr -d '\\n'\n```\n\nOr use a Node.js library like `web-push`:\n\n```javascript\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\nconst vapidKeys = webpush.generateVAPIDKeys();\nconsole.log('Public Key:', vapidKeys.publicKey);\nconsole.log('Private Key:', vapidKeys.privateKey);\n```\n\n---\n\n### User Journey for iOS\n\n1.

However, these notifications **only work for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that are installed on the user's home screen** — they do not work in the regular Safari browser.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **HTTPS Required**: Your website must be served over HTTPS\n2. **PWA Compliance**: Your site must function as a Progressive Web App\n3. **User Installation**: Users must add your app to their Home Screen via Safari's Share menu\n4. **User Gesture**: Push permission prompts must be triggered by user interaction (e.g., clicking a button)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Web Application Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file in your website's root directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"AppName\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: The `display` field must be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` for iOS web push to work.\n\nLink the manifest in your HTML `<head>`:\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Generate VAPID Keys\n\nVAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys are required for push notifications. Generate them using OpenSSL:\n\n```bash\n# Generate private key\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out vapid_private.pem\n\n# Generate public key\nopenssl ec -in vapid_private.pem -pubout -out vapid_public.pem\n\n# Convert to base64 URL-safe format for use in JavaScript\nopenssl ec -in vapid_private.pem -outform DER | tail -c +8 | head -c 32 | base64 | tr -d '=' | tr '/+' '_-'\nopenssl ec -in vapid_public.pem -pubin -outform DER | tail -c 65 | base64 | tr -d '=' | tr '/+' '_-'\n```\n\nOr use a Node.js library like `web-push`:\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Implement a Service Worker (`sw.js`)\n\nCreate a service worker file at your website's root:\n\n```javascript\n// sw.js - Service Worker for handling push notifications\n\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  if (!event.data) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const data = event.data.json();\n  \n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || 'You have a new notification',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: data.badge || '/icons/badge-72x72.png',\n    vibrate: [100, 50, 100],\n    data: {\n      url: data.url || '/'\n    },\n    actions: data.actions || []\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data.title || 'Notification', options)\n  );\n});\n\n// Handle notification click\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n\n  const urlToOpen = event.notification.data.url || '/';\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.matchAll({ type: 'window', includeUncontrolled: true })\n      .then(function(clientList) {\n        // Check if there's already a window open\n        for (let client of clientList) {\n          if (client.url === urlToOpen && 'focus' in client) {\n            return client.focus();\n          }\n        }\n        // Open a new window if none exists\n        if (clients.openWindow) {\n          return clients.openWindow(urlToOpen);\n        }\n      })\n  );\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Register Service Worker and Request Permission (Client-Side JavaScript)\n\n```javascript\n// app.js - Main application JavaScript\n\nconst VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY_HERE';

Open your website in **Safari** on iOS\n2. Tap the **Share button** (square with arrow pointing up)\n3. Scroll down and tap **\"Add to Home Screen\"**\n4. Give the app a name and tap **\"Add\"**\n5. Open the app from your Home Screen\n6. Tap the **\"Enable Notifications\"** button\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes & Limitations\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **iOS Version** | iOS 16.4 or later required |\n| **Browser** | Must be Safari (no third-party browsers) |\n| **Installation** | User must add to Home Screen |\n| **HTTPS** | Required for all pages |\n| **User Gesture** | Permission must be requested from a click/tap event |\n| **Display Mode** | Manifest must use `standalone` or `fullscreen` |\n\n---\n\n### Testing Your Implementation\n\n1. Deploy your manifest and service worker to your HTTPS server\n2. Add your PWA to the Home Screen on an iOS 16.4+ device\n3. Launch the app from the Home Screen (not from Safari)\n4. Click the notifications button\n5. Accept the permission prompt\n6.

However, these notifications **only work for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that are installed on the user's home screen** — they do not work in the regular Safari browser.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **HTTPS Required**: Your website must be served over HTTPS\n2. **PWA Compliance**: Your site must function as a Progressive Web App\n3. **User Installation**: Users must add your app to their Home Screen via Safari's Share menu\n4. **User Gesture**: Push permission prompts must be triggered by user interaction (e.g., clicking a button)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Web Application Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file in your website's root directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"AppName\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: The `display` field must be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` for iOS web push to work.\n\nLink the manifest in your HTML `<head>`:\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Generate VAPID Keys\n\nVAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys are required for push notifications. Generate them using OpenSSL:\n\n```bash\n# Generate private key\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out vapid_private.pem\n\n# Generate public key\nopenssl ec -in vapid_private.pem -pubout -out vapid_public.pem\n\n# Convert to base64 URL-safe format for use in JavaScript\nopenssl ec -in vapid_private.pem -outform DER | tail -c +8 | head -c 32 | base64 | tr -d '=' | tr '/+' '_-'\nopenssl ec -in vapid_public.pem -pubin -outform DER | tail -c 65 | base64 | tr -d '=' | tr '/+' '_-'\n```\n\nOr use a Node.js library like `web-push`:\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Implement a Service Worker (`sw.js`)\n\nCreate a service worker file at your website's root:\n\n```javascript\n// sw.js - Service Worker for handling push notifications\n\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  if (!event.data) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const data = event.data.json();\n  \n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || 'You have a new notification',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: data.badge || '/icons/badge-72x72.png',\n    vibrate: [100, 50, 100],\n    data: {\n      url: data.url || '/'\n    },\n    actions: data.actions || []\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data.title || 'Notification', options)\n  );\n});\n\n// Handle notification click\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n\n  const urlToOpen = event.notification.data.url || '/';\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.matchAll({ type: 'window', includeUncontrolled: true })\n      .then(function(clientList) {\n        // Check if there's already a window open\n        for (let client of clientList) {\n          if (client.url === urlToOpen && 'focus' in client) {\n            return client.focus();\n          }\n        }\n        // Open a new window if none exists\n        if (clients.openWindow) {\n          return clients.openWindow(urlToOpen);\n        }\n      })\n  );\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Register Service Worker and Request Permission (Client-Side JavaScript)\n\n```javascript\n// app.js - Main application JavaScript\n\nconst VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY_HERE'; // Base64 URL-safe encoded\n\n// Check if push notifications are supported\nfunction isPushSupported() {\n  return 'serviceWorker' in navigator && \n         'PushManager' in window && \n         'Notification' in window;\n}\n\n// Check if app is running in standalone mode (installed on home screen)\nfunction isStandalone() {\n  return window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches ||\n         window.navigator.standalone === true;\n}\n\n// Register Service Worker\nasync function registerServiceWorker() {\n  try {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');\n    console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration.scope);\n    return registration;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Convert VAPID key from base64 to Uint8Array\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n  \n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\n// Subscribe to push notifications\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  try {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    \n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY)\n    });\n    \n    console.log('Push subscription:', JSON.stringify(subscription));\n    \n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n    \n    return subscription;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Push subscription failed:', error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Send subscription to your backend server\nasync function sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription) {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/push/subscribe', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(subscription)\n  });\n  \n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new Error('Failed to send subscription to server');\n  }\n}\n\n// Main function to request push notification permission\n// IMPORTANT: This MUST be called from a user gesture (click event)\nasync function enablePushNotifications() {\n  if (!isPushSupported()) {\n    alert('Push notifications are not supported in this browser');\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  if (!isStandalone()) {\n    alert('Please add this app to your Home Screen first to enable notifications');\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  try {\n    // Request notification permission\n    const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n    \n    if (permission === 'granted') {\n      await registerServiceWorker();\n      await subscribeToPush();\n      console.log('Push notifications enabled!');\n    } else {\n      console.log('Notification permission denied');\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error enabling push notifications:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Initialize on page load\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {\n  if (isPushSupported()) {\n    await registerServiceWorker();\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Add User Interface Button (HTML)\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\">\n  <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"default\">\n  <link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n  <link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/icons/icon-192x192.png\">\n  <title>Your PWA</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Welcome to Your App</h1>\n  \n  <!-- Enable notifications button - MUST be a user gesture -->\n  <button id=\"enable-notifications\" onclick=\"enablePushNotifications()\">\n    Enable Notifications\n  </button>\n  \n  <script src=\"/app.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Backend Server Implementation (Node.js Example)\n\n```javascript\n// server.js - Backend for sending push notifications\nconst webPush = require('web-push');\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Configure VAPID details\nwebPush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  'YOUR_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY',\n  'YOUR_PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY'\n);\n\n// Store subscriptions (use a database in production)\nconst subscriptions = [];\n\n// Endpoint to receive push subscriptions\napp.post('/api/push/subscribe', (req, res) => {\n  const subscription = req.body;\n  subscriptions.push(subscription);\n  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Subscription saved' });\n});\n\n// Endpoint to send push notification\napp.post('/api/push/send', async (req, res) => {\n  const { title, body, url } = req.body;\n  \n  const payload = JSON.stringify({\n    title,\n    body,\n    url\n  });\n  \n  const results = await Promise.allSettled(\n    subscriptions.map(subscription => \n      webPush.sendNotification(subscription, payload)\n    )\n  );\n  \n  res.json({ sent: results.length });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server running on port 3000');\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### User Instructions for Adding to Home Screen\n\nProvide clear instructions to your users:\n\n1. Open your website in **Safari** on iOS\n2. Tap the **Share button** (square with arrow pointing up)\n3. Scroll down and tap **\"Add to Home Screen\"**\n4. Give the app a name and tap **\"Add\"**\n5. Open the app from your Home Screen\n6. Tap the **\"Enable Notifications\"** button\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes & Limitations\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **iOS Version** | iOS 16.4 or later required |\n| **Browser** | Must be Safari (no third-party browsers) |\n| **Installation** | User must add to Home Screen |\n| **HTTPS** | Required for all pages |\n| **User Gesture** | Permission must be requested from a click/tap event |\n| **Display Mode** | Manifest must use `standalone` or `fullscreen` |\n\n---\n\n### Testing Your Implementation\n\n1. Deploy your manifest and service worker to your HTTPS server\n2. Add your PWA to the Home Screen on an iOS 16.4+ device\n3. Launch the app from the Home Screen (not from Safari)\n4. Click the notifications button\n5. Accept the permission prompt\n6.

comprehensive guide on **how to set up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Guide)\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Node.js v18 or newer\n- A package manager: **pnpm** (recommended), **bun**, **npm**, or **yarn**\n- Basic knowledge of React/Next.js\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Turborepo Project\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest\n\n# Or using bun\nbunx create-turbo@latest\n\n# Or using npx\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n```\n\nWhen prompted:\n- Choose your project name\n- Select your preferred package manager (pnpm recommended for monorepos)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS v4 Dependencies\n\nNavigate to your packages and install Tailwind CSS:\n\n**In the UI package (`/packages/ui`):**\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\n**In each app (`/apps/web`, etc.):**\n```bash\ncd apps/web\npnpm add -D @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Configure PostCSS\n\nCreate `/packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\nCreate the same config in each app that uses the UI package.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Set Up Global Styles\n\nCreate `/packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  --font-sans: \"Inter\", sans-serif;\n  \n  /* shadcn/ui CSS variables */\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --card: oklch(1 0 0);\n

--radius: 0.625rem;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Initialize shadcn/ui for Monorepo\n\nFrom the **root** of your Turborepo, run:\n\n```bash\n# For monorepo setup (use the canary version for best monorepo support)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n```\n\nWhen prompted:\n- Select the package where you want to install components (typically `packages/ui`)\n- Choose your style preferences\n- Select the components base directory\n\n**Alternatively**, create `/packages/ui/components.json` manually:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@repo/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@repo/ui/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@repo/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@repo/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Update TypeScript Configuration\n\nIn `/packages/ui/tsconfig.json`, add path aliases:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Add shadcn/ui Components\n\nFrom the root directory (or the ui package directory):\n\n```bash\n# Add components to the UI package\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button -c packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add card -c packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add input -c packages/ui\n# Add any other components you need\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Export Components from UI Package\n\nUpdate `/packages/ui/package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/ui/*.tsx\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"eslint .\",\n    \"generate:component\": \"pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Use Components in Your Apps\n\n**In your app (e.g., `/apps/web/app/layout.tsx`):**\n\n```tsx\nimport \"@repo/ui/globals.css\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**In a page or component:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/components/button\";\nimport { Card } from \"@repo/ui/components/card\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Button>Click me!</Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Configure Tailwind Content Paths (Important!)\n\nIn each app's `postcss.config.mjs` or tailwind config, ensure the UI package is included in the content paths:\n\n```javascript\n// apps/web/tailwind.config.ts (if using config file)\nexport default {\n  content: [\n    \"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n    \"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n    \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\", // Include UI package\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Project Structure\n\n```\nmy-turborepo/\n├── apps/\n│   ├── web/                    # Next.js app\n│   │   ├── app/\n│   │   ├──

package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Tips for 2026\n\n1. **Use `shadcn@canary`** - The canary version has the best monorepo support with the `-c` flag for specifying component directories.\n\n2. **Tailwind CSS v4** - shadcn/ui now works seamlessly with Tailwind CSS v4's new CSS-first configuration approach.\n\n3. **Official Documentation** - Always check the official docs at:\n   - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo\n   - https://turbo.build/repo/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui\n\n4. **pnpm is recommended** - Better dependency management and disk space efficiency for monorepos.\n\n5. **Remote Caching** - Enable Turborepo's remote caching for faster builds across your team.\n\n---\n\nThis setup gives you a scalable monorepo where UI components are shared across all your applications with consistent styling and type safety!","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026

84% 4.9%;\n    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;\n    /* ... dark mode variables */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Initialize shadcn/ui in the UI Package\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\n\n# Using pnpm\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\n**Configuration options during init:**\n- Style: Default or New York\n- Base color: Choose your preference\n- CSS variables: Yes\n- Tailwind CSS config location: Point to your config\n- Components location: `./src/components`\n- Utils location: `./src/lib/utils`\n\n---\n\n## Step 8: Create `components.json` (if not auto-created)\n\nIn `/packages/ui/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"default\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\":

Step 9: Add shadcn Components\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\n\n# Add specific components\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add input\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dialog\n\n# Or add multiple at once\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input dialog\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 10: Export Components from UI Package\n\nUpdate `/packages/ui/src/index.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// Export globals\nexport \"./globals.css\";\n\n// Export components\nexport * from \"./components/ui/button\";\nexport * from \"./components/ui/card\";\nexport * from \"./components/ui/input\";\nexport * from \"./components/ui/dialog\";\n\n// Export utilities\nexport { cn } from \"./lib/utils\";\n```\n\nUpdate `/packages/ui/package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \".\": \"./src/index.ts\",\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./src/globals.css\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.300.0\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^18 || ^19\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18 || ^19\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 11: Use Components in Your App\n\nIn `/apps/web`, first add the UI package as a dependency:\n\n```json\n// apps/web/package.json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@repo/ui\": \"workspace:*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nImport globals in your app's layout (`apps/web/app/layout.tsx`):\n\n```typescript\nimport \"@repo/ui/globals.css\";\n```\n\nUse components:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button, Card, Input } from \"@repo/ui\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Card className=\"p-6\">\n      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>\n      <Input placeholder=\"Enter your name\" />\n      <Button>Click Me</Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 12: Configure Transpilation (Important!)\n\nIn `/apps/web/next.config.js`:\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: [\"@repo/ui\"],\n};\n\nexport default nextConfig;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 13: Run Your Monorepo\n\nFrom the root directory:\n\n```bash\n# Install all dependencies\nbun install  # or pnpm install\n\n# Run development\nbun dev      # or pnpm dev\n```\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep components in the UI package**: All shadcn components should live in `packages/ui`\n2. **Use workspace protocol**: Always reference internal packages with `workspace:*`\n3. **Transpile packages**: Ensure Next.js transpiles the UI package\n4. **Centralize Tailwind config**: Share Tailwind configuration across apps\n5. **Export properly**: Use explicit exports in `package.json` for better tree-shaking\n\n---\n\n## Common Issues & Solutions\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Styles not applying | Ensure `globals.css` is imported in your app |\n| Module not found | Check `transpilePackages` in Next.js config |\n| TypeScript errors | Ensure `tsconfig.json` extends workspace config |\n| Component not exported | Add export to `packages/ui/src/index.ts` |\n\n---\n\n## Official Resources\n\n- **Turborepo shadcn/ui Guide**: https://turborepo.dev/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui\n- **shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs**:

Let me compile a comprehensive tutorial for setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo in 2026.\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Tutorial)\n\n## Overview\n\nshadcn/ui now has official monorepo support, making it significantly easier to use in Turborepo projects. The CLI understands monorepo structures and automatically handles component installation, dependencies, and import paths.\n\n---\n\n## Method 1: Create a New Monorepo Project (Recommended)\n\n### Step 1: Initialize the Project\n\nRun the shadcn init command and select the monorepo option:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using yarn\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@canary init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select **\"Next.js (Monorepo)\"**.\n\nThis creates a complete monorepo with:\n- **Turborepo** as the build system\n- Two workspaces: `apps/web` and `packages/ui`\n- **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS v4** pre-configured\n\n### Step 2: Project Structure\n\nAfter initialization, your project structure will look like:\n\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/                    # Next.js application\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for app\n│       └── ...\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/                     # Shared UI components\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for UI package\n│       ├── src/\n│       │   ├── components/\n│       │   ├── hooks/\n│       │   └── lib/\n│       └── ...\n├── turbo.json\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add Components\n\nRun the add command **from your app directory**:\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\n\n# Add a single component\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n\n# Add multiple components\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button card input label\n\n# Add a block (pre-built UI section)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add login-01\n```\n\nThe CLI automatically:\n- Installs **UI components** (button, card, etc.) to `packages/ui`\n- Installs **page components/blocks** to `apps/web/components`\n- Updates import paths correctly\n\n### Step 4: Import Components\n\nImport components from the `@workspace/ui` package:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card, CardContent } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\nimport { useIsMobile } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-mobile\"\n\nexport default function MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button>Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Method 2: Add to Existing Turborepo\n\n### Step 1: Create components.json Files\n\nYou need a `components.json` in **every workspace** that uses shadcn components.\n\n**`apps/web/components.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**`packages/ui/components.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"./src/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"./src/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"./src/lib\",\n    \"ui\": \"./src/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"./src/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the UI Package\n\n**`packages/ui/package.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.400.0\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create Utility Files\n\n**`packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:**\n```ts\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\"\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\"\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Configure Tailwind CSS v4\n\n**`packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:**\n```js\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\n**`packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:**\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Your theme variables */\n  --color-background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --color-foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --color-primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n  --color-primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);\n  /* ... add more theme colors */\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Import Styles in Your App\n\n**`apps/web/app/globals.css`:**\n```css\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles/globals.css\";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| **components.json in each workspace** | Tells the CLI how to install components |\n| **Matching style/iconLibrary/baseColor** | Must be consistent across all `components.json` files |\n| **Proper aliases** | Define import paths for components, hooks, and utilities |\n| **Empty tailwind config for v4** | Leave `\"tailwind\": {}` for Tailwind CSS v4 |\n\n---\n\n## Common Commands Reference\n\n```bash\n# Initialize new monorepo\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Add components (run from app directory)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add card input label textarea\n\n# Add a complete block/template\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add login-01\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add dashboard-01\n\n# List available components\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n1. **Components installing in wrong location**: Ensure you run `add` commands from your app directory (`apps/web`), not the root.\n\n2. **Import errors**: Verify your `tsconfig.json` has the correct path mappings for `@workspace/ui`.\n\n3. **Styles not applying**: Make sure your app imports the global styles from the UI package.\n\n4. **Type errors**: Ensure `peerDependencies` match in both packages (React 19, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo\n- **Turborepo shadcn/ui Guide**: https://turbo.build/repo/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui\n-

Let me compile a comprehensive tutorial for setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo in 2026.\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Tutorial)\n\n## Overview\n\nshadcn/ui now has official monorepo support, making it significantly easier to use in Turborepo projects. The CLI understands monorepo structures and automatically handles component installation, dependencies, and import paths.\n\n---\n\n## Method 1: Create a New Monorepo Project (Recommended)\n\n### Step 1: Initialize the Project\n\nRun the shadcn init command and select the monorepo option:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using yarn\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@canary init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select **\"Next.js (Monorepo)\"**.\n\nThis creates a complete monorepo with:\n- **Turborepo** as the build system\n- Two workspaces: `apps/web` and `packages/ui`\n- **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS v4** pre-configured\n\n### Step 2: Project Structure\n\nAfter initialization, your project structure will look like:\n\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/                    # Next.js application\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for app\n│       └── ...\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/                     # Shared UI components\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for UI package\n│       ├── src/\n│       │   ├── components/\n│       │   ├── hooks/\n│       │   └── lib/\n│       └── ...\n├── turbo.json\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add Components\n\nRun the add command **from your app directory**:\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\n\n# Add a single component\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n\n# Add multiple components\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button card input label\n\n# Add a block (pre-built UI section)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add login-01\n```\n\nThe CLI automatically:\n- Installs **UI components** (button, card, etc.) to `packages/ui`\n- Installs **page components/blocks** to `apps/web/components`\n- Updates import paths correctly\n\n### Step 4: Import Components\n\nImport components from the `@workspace/ui` package:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card, CardContent } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\nimport { useIsMobile } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-mobile\"\n\nexport default function MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button>Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Method 2: Add to Existing Turborepo\n\n### Step 1: Create components.json Files\n\nYou need a `components.json` in **every workspace** that uses shadcn components.\n\n**`apps/web/components.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**`packages/ui/components.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"./src/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"./src/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"./src/lib\",\n    \"ui\": \"./src/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"./src/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the UI Package\n\n**`packages/ui/package.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.2.0\",\n    \"lucide-react\": \"^0.400.0\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create Utility Files\n\n**`packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:**\n```ts\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\"\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\"\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Configure Tailwind CSS v4\n\n**`packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:**\n```js\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\n**`packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:**\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Your theme variables */\n  --color-background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --color-foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --color-primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n  --color-primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);\n  /* ... add more theme colors */\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Import Styles in Your App\n\n**`apps/web/app/globals.css`:**\n```css\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles/globals.css\";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| **components.json in each workspace** | Tells the CLI how to install components |\n| **Matching style/iconLibrary/baseColor** | Must be consistent across all `components.json` files |\n| **Proper aliases** | Define import paths for components, hooks, and utilities |\n| **Empty tailwind config for v4** | Leave `\"tailwind\": {}` for Tailwind CSS v4 |\n\n---\n\n## Common Commands Reference\n\n```bash\n# Initialize new monorepo\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Add components (run from app directory)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add card input label textarea\n\n# Add a complete block/template\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add login-01\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add dashboard-01\n\n# List available components\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n1. **Components installing in wrong location**: Ensure you run `add` commands from your app directory (`apps/web`), not the root.\n\n2. **Import errors**: Verify your `tsconfig.json` has the correct path mappings for `@workspace/ui`.\n\n3. **Styles not applying**: Make sure your app imports the global styles from the UI package.\n\n4. **Type errors**: Ensure `peerDependencies` match in both packages (React 19, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo\n- **Turborepo shadcn/ui Guide**: https://turbo.build/repo/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui\n-

This tells shadcn to set up the configuration appropriately for a monorepo structure.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Configure components.json\n\nThe init command will create a `components.json` file. For a monorepo, ensure it points to your UI package:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"packages/ui/tailwind.config.ts\",\n    \"css\": \"packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@repo/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Add Components\n\nAdd shadcn components to your UI package:\n\n```bash\n# From project root\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add input\n# Add any other components you need\n```\n\nComponents will be added to `packages/ui/src/components/ui/`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Export Components from UI Package\n\nUpdate your UI package's main export file (`packages/ui/src/index.ts`):\n\n```typescript\n// Export all shadcn components\nexport * from \"./components/ui/button\";\nexport * from \"./components/ui/card\";\nexport * from \"./components/ui/input\";\n// Add other component exports\n\n// Export the cn utility\nexport { cn } from \"./lib/utils\";\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Use Components in Your Apps\n\nIn your apps (e.g., `apps/web`), import from the UI package:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button, Card, Input } from \"@repo/ui\";\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Input placeholder=\"Enter text...\" />\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nMake sure your app imports the global CSS:\n\n```tsx\n// In your app's layout or _app file\nimport \"@repo/ui/styles/globals.css\";\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Update App's Tailwind Config\n\nYour app should extend the UI package's Tailwind configuration. In `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\nimport sharedConfig from \"@repo/ui/tailwind.config\";\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  ...sharedConfig,\n  content: [\n    \"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}\",\n    \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}\",\n  ],\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n---\n\n### Project Structure Overview\n\n```\nmy-turborepo/\n├── apps/\n│   ├── web/                    # Next.js app\n│   │   ├── src/\n│   │   ├── tailwind.config.ts\n│   │   └── package.json\n│   └── docs/                   # Another app (optional)\n├── packages/\n│   ├── ui/                     # Shared UI package with shadcn\n│   │   ├── src/\n│   │   │   ├── components/\n│   │   │   │   └── ui/         # shadcn components\n│   │   │   ├── lib/\n│   │   │   │   └── utils.ts    # cn() utility\n│   │   │   └── styles/\n│   │   │       └── globals.css\n│   │   ├── tailwind.config.ts\n│   │   ├── postcss.config.mjs\n│   │   └── package.json\n│   ├── typescript-config/\n│   └── eslint-config/\n├── components.json             # shadcn config at root\n├── turbo.json\n├── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n└── package.json\n```\n\n---\n\n### Tips & Best Practices\n\n1. **Use the official Turborepo docs**: The official Turborepo documentation at `turborepo.dev/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui` has up-to-date instructions.\n\n2. **Centralize your UI**: Keep all shadcn components in `packages/ui` to share across all apps.\n\n3. **Version consistency**: Ensure all apps use the same version of React and Tailwind CSS.\n\n4. **Use TypeScript**: Enable strict TypeScript for type safety across the monorepo.\n\n5. **Leverage Turborepo caching**: Configure `turbo.json` to cache builds for faster development.\n\n---\n\n### Useful Resources\n\n- **Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo\n- **Turborepo shadcn Guide**: https://turborepo.dev/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui\n- **Turborepo Starter Templates**: Check GitHub for pre-configured templates\n\nThis setup allows you to efficiently manage and share beautifully designed UI components across multiple applications in your Turborepo monorepo!","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":40233},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":40233},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QwbWjTFbDi6ZGGSTkwqYsr","status":"completed","timestamp":40233},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to set up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## How to Set Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Guide)\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Node.js v18 or newer\n- Package manager: pnpm, npm, yarn, or bun (pnpm or bun recommended)\n- Basic knowledge of React/Next.js\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Turborepo\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest\n\n# Or using bun\nbunx create-turbo@latest\n\n# Or using npm\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n```\n\nWhen prompted:\n- Enter your project name\n- Select your preferred package manager\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Tailwind CSS in the UI Package\n\nNavigate to your UI package and install Tailwind CSS v4:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\n\n# Using pnpm\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n\n# Or using bun\nbun add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Configure PostCSS\n\nCreate `/packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Set Up Global Styles\n\nCreate `/packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Initialize shadcn/ui\n\nFrom your **project root**, run the shadcn init command:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn dlx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\n**Important:** When prompted, select the **monorepo** option.

Installation\n\nFirst, install Swiper:\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n# or\nyarn add swiper\n```\n\n### 2. Basic Implementation\n\nCreate a slider component (e.g., `components/ImageSlider.tsx`):\n\n```tsx\n'use client'; // Required for Next.js App Router\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport 'swiper/css/effect-fade';\n\ninterface SlideData {\n  id: number;\n  src: string;\n  alt: string;\n}\n\ninterface ImageSliderProps {\n  slides: SlideData[];\n}\n\nexport default function ImageSlider({ slides }: ImageSliderProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-full\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{\n          delay: 5000,\n          disableOnInteraction: false,\n        }}\n        loop={true}\n        className=\"w-full h-[400px] md:h-[500px] lg:h-[600px]\"\n      >\n        {slides.map((slide) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={slide.id}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-full\">\n              <Image\n                src={slide.src}\n                alt={slide.alt}\n                fill\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                priority\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Key Configuration Points\n\n**For the Next.js Image component:**\n- Use `fill` prop to make images fill the parent container\n- Set `style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}` to maintain aspect ratio while covering the full area\n- Use `sizes=\"100vw\"` for full-width responsive images\n- Add `priority` to the first few slides for faster LCP\n\n**For Swiper:**\n- Set `slidesPerView={1}` for full-width slides\n- Set `spaceBetween={0}` for no gaps between slides\n- Use `loop={true}` for infinite scrolling\n- Add `Navigation` and `Pagination` modules for user controls\n\n### 4. CSS Styling (Optional Custom Styles)\n\n```css\n/* globals.css or a separate CSS file */\n.swiper {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\n.swiper-slide {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\n/* Custom navigation button styles */\n.swiper-button-next,\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  background: white;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Usage Example\n\n```tsx\n// app/page.tsx or pages/index.tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider';\n\nconst slides = [\n  { id: 1, src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { id: 2, src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { id: 3, src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <ImageSlider slides={slides} />\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Important Notes for 2026\n\n1. **Use `'use client'` directive** - Required when using Swiper in Next.js App Router since Swiper relies on browser APIs.\n\n2. **Lazy loading consideration** - Be aware of the lazy loading bug mentioned in Swiper issue #8149. If using lazy loading, ensure the `onLoad` callback doesn't set `lazyloaded` prematurely.\n\n3. **Remote images** - If using external images, configure `next.config.js`:\n   ```js\n   module.exports = {\n     images: {\n       remotePatterns: [\n         {\n           protocol: 'https',\n           hostname: 'your-image-domain.com',\n         },\n       ],\n     },\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Performance optimization** - Use `priority` only on above-the-fold images and `loading=\"lazy\"` for others to improve Core Web Vitals.\n\nThis setup gives you a fully responsive, full-width image slider that works well across all device sizes with optimized image loading through Next.js Image component.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":30944},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":30944},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01T1xE13J69iYNbYA9terdDv","status":"completed","timestamp":30944},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive guide on building a full-width responsive image slider using Next.js Image component and Swiper in 2026.\n\n## Building a Full-Width Responsive Image Slider with Next.js Image and Swiper\n\n### 1.

Alternative: Fixed Aspect Ratio Slider\n\n```tsx\n// components/AspectRatioSlider.tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, EffectFade } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport 'swiper/css/effect-fade';\n\ninterface SliderProps {\n  images: { src: string; alt: string }[];\n  aspectRatio?: string; // e.g., \"16/9\", \"4/3\", \"21/9\"\n}\n\nexport default function AspectRatioSlider({ \n  images, \n  aspectRatio = \"16/9\" \n}: SliderProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-full\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, EffectFade]}\n        effect=\"fade\"\n        fadeEffect={{ crossFade: true }}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        loop={true}\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <div \n              className=\"relative w-full\"\n              style={{ aspectRatio }}\n            >\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                fill\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                priority={index === 0}\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Custom Styling (Optional CSS)\n\n```css\n/* styles/slider.css */\n.swiper {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n\n.swiper-button-next,\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: white;\n  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n  padding: 30px 20px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\n.swiper-button-next:after,\n.swiper-button-prev:after {\n  font-size: 20px;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet {\n  background: white;\n  opacity: 0.7;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  opacity: 1;\n  background: white;\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Usage Example\n\n```tsx\n// app/page.tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider';\n\nconst images = [\n  { src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <ImageSlider images={images} />\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 7. For External Images (next.config.js)\n\n```js\n// next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n      },\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'images.unsplash.com',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **'use client' directive** - Required for Swiper components in Next.js App Router\n2. **`fill` prop** - Makes the Image component fill its parent container (parent must have `position: relative`)\n3. **`sizes=\"100vw\"`** - Tells Next.js the image will be full viewport width for proper optimization\n4. **`priority`** - Add to first slide for faster LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n5. **`objectFit: 'cover'`** - Ensures images cover the container while maintaining aspect ratio\n\n### Performance Tips:\n\n- Use `lazy` loading for non-critical sliders (Swiper handles this automatically after first few slides)\n- Use `priority` only on the first slide\n- Consider using `placeholder=\"blur\"` with `blurDataURL` for better UX\n- For very large sliders, enable Swiper's `virtual` slides feature","timestamp":36624}],"duration":36624,"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

Installation\n\nFirst, install Swiper in your Next.js project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n# or\nyarn add swiper\n```\n\n### 2. Import Required CSS\n\nIn your `layout.tsx` or `_app.tsx` (depending on your Next.js version), import the necessary Swiper styles:\n\n```javascript\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\n```\n\n### 3. Create the Full-Width Image Slider Component\n\nCreate a new component file (e.g., `components/ImageSlider.tsx`):\n\n```tsx\n'use client'; // Required for Next.js App Router\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\n\ninterface SlideImage {\n  src: string;\n  alt: string;\n}\n\ninterface ImageSliderProps {\n  images: SlideImage[];\n  autoplay?: boolean;\n  autoplayDelay?: number;\n}\n\nexport default function ImageSlider({ \n  images, \n  autoplay = true, \n  autoplayDelay = 5000 \n}: ImageSliderProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"full-width-slider\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        loop={true}\n        autoplay={autoplay ? {\n          delay: autoplayDelay,\n          disableOnInteraction: false,\n        } : false}\n        style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <div className=\"slide-container\">\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                priority={index === 0} // Prioritize first image\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n\n      <style jsx global>{`\n        .full-width-slider {\n          width: 100vw;\n          position: relative;\n          left: 50%;\n          right: 50%;\n          margin-left: -50vw;\n          margin-right: -50vw;\n        }\n\n        .slide-container {\n          position: relative;\n          width: 100%;\n          height: 60vh; /* Adjust height as needed */\n          min-height: 300px;\n        }\n\n        @media (min-width: 768px) {\n          .slide-container {\n            height: 70vh;\n          }\n        }\n\n        @media (min-width: 1024px) {\n          .slide-container {\n            height: 80vh;\n          }\n        }\n\n        /* Custom navigation button styles */\n        .swiper-button-next,\n        .swiper-button-prev {\n          color: white;\n          background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n          padding: 30px 20px;\n          border-radius: 5px;\n        }\n\n        .swiper-button-next:hover,\n        .swiper-button-prev:hover {\n          background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n        }\n\n        /* Custom pagination styles */\n        .swiper-pagination-bullet {\n          background: white;\n          opacity: 0.7;\n        }\n\n        .swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n          opacity: 1;\n        }\n      `}</style>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Usage Example\n\nUse the slider in your page component:\n\n```tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider';\n\nconst images = [\n  { src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <ImageSlider \n        images={images} \n        autoplay={true} \n        autoplayDelay={4000} \n      />\n      {/* Rest of your page content */}\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Tailwind CSS Alternative (if using Tailwind)\n\nIf you're using Tailwind CSS, here's a cleaner approach:\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\n\ninterface SlideImage {\n  src: string;\n  alt: string;\n}\n\nexport default function ImageSlider({ images }: { images: SlideImage[] }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-screen relative -mx-[50vw] left-1/2 right-1/2\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        loop={true}\n        autoplay={{\n          delay: 5000,\n          disableOnInteraction: false,\n        }}\n        className=\"w-full\"\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-[60vh] md:h-[70vh] lg:h-[80vh] min-h-[300px]\">\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                className=\"object-cover\"\n                priority={index === 0}\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Configure next.config.js for External Images (if needed)\n\nIf using external image URLs, update your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'your-image-domain.com',\n        pathname: '/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig;\n```\n\n### Key Features & Best Practices\n\n1. **`'use client'` directive** - Required for Swiper in Next.js App Router since it uses client-side JavaScript\n\n2. **`fill` prop on Image** - Makes the image fill its parent container, essential for responsive full-width slides\n\n3. **`sizes=\"100vw\"`** - Tells Next.js the image will be full viewport width for proper srcset generation\n\n4. **`priority` on first image** - Preloads the first slide for better LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n\n5. **`objectFit: 'cover'`** - Ensures images cover the slide area while maintaining aspect ratio\n\n6. **Responsive breakpoints** - Swiper supports responsive configuration:\n\n```tsx\n<Swiper\n  breakpoints={{\n    0: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    768: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    1024: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n### Known Issues (2026)\n\nBased on recent GitHub issues, be aware of a lazy loading bug where the `lazy` prop can cause carousel crashes. If you need lazy loading, handle it through the Next.js Image component's built-in lazy loading (which is the default behavior) rather than Swiper's native lazy loading.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":41365},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":41365},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014wbkGzWZ8LF3wFKNsBbws7","status":"completed","timestamp":41365},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01StjrKAyhc6tRx6vGJRyNWq","status":"completed","timestamp":41365},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive guide on building a full-width responsive image slider using Next.js Image component and Swiper in 2026.\n\n## Building a Full-Width Responsive Image Slider with Next.js Image and Swiper\n\n### 1.

Usage Example\n\nUse the slider in your page component:\n\n```tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider';\n\nconst images = [\n  { src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <ImageSlider \n        images={images} \n        autoplay={true} \n        autoplayDelay={4000} \n      />\n      {/* Rest of your page content */}\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Tailwind CSS Alternative (if using Tailwind)\n\nIf you're using Tailwind CSS, here's a cleaner approach:\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\n\ninterface SlideImage {\n  src: string;\n  alt: string;\n}\n\nexport default function ImageSlider({ images }: { images: SlideImage[] }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-screen relative -mx-[50vw] left-1/2 right-1/2\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        loop={true}\n        autoplay={{\n          delay: 5000,\n          disableOnInteraction: false,\n        }}\n        className=\"w-full\"\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-[60vh] md:h-[70vh] lg:h-[80vh] min-h-[300px]\">\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                className=\"object-cover\"\n                priority={index === 0}\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Configure next.config.js for External Images (if needed)\n\nIf using external image URLs, update your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'your-image-domain.com',\n        pathname: '/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig;\n```\n\n### Key Features & Best Practices\n\n1. **`'use client'` directive** - Required for Swiper in Next.js App Router since it uses client-side JavaScript\n\n2. **`fill` prop on Image** - Makes the image fill its parent container, essential for responsive full-width slides\n\n3. **`sizes=\"100vw\"`** - Tells Next.js the image will be full viewport width for proper srcset generation\n\n4. **`priority` on first image** - Preloads the first slide for better LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n\n5. **`objectFit: 'cover'`** - Ensures images cover the slide area while maintaining aspect ratio\n\n6. **Responsive breakpoints** - Swiper supports responsive configuration:\n\n```tsx\n<Swiper\n  breakpoints={{\n    0: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    768: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    1024: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n  }}\n>\n```\n\n### Known Issues (2026)\n\nBased on recent GitHub issues, be aware of a lazy loading bug where the `lazy` prop can cause carousel crashes. If you need lazy loading, handle it through the Next.js Image component's built-in lazy loading (which is the default behavior) rather than Swiper's native lazy loading.","timestamp":41365}],"duration":41365,"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

onClick Interaction for Checkbox Labels and Inputs in 2026\n\nBased on current best practices, here's a comprehensive guide for handling React checkbox interactions:\n\n### 1. **Use `onChange` Instead of `onClick` for Checkboxes**\nThe recommended approach is to use the `onChange` event handler rather than `onClick` for checkbox inputs:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction CheckboxExample() {\n    const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n    return (\n        <label>\n            <input \n                type=\"checkbox\" \n                checked={isChecked} \n                onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)} \n            />\n            Subscribe to updates\n        </label>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Proper Label Association with `htmlFor`**\nIn React, use `htmlFor` (not `for`) to associate labels with checkboxes:\n\n```jsx\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"myCheckbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n<label htmlFor=\"myCheckbox\">Click me to toggle</label>\n```\n\nThis ensures clicking the label also toggles the checkbox.\n\n### 3. **Controlled Components (Recommended)**\nAlways use controlled components where React manages the checkbox state:\n\n```jsx\nconst [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);\n\n<input \n    type=\"checkbox\" \n    checked={checked}           // Controlled by React state\n    onChange={(e) => setChecked(e.target.checked)} \n/>\n```\n\n### 4. **Handling Container `onClick` with Checkbox**\nIf you have a clickable container wrapping a checkbox, avoid event conflicts:\n\n```jsx\nfunction ClickableRow({ item, onToggle }) {\n    return (\n        <div onClick={() => onToggle(item.id)}>\n            <input \n                type=\"checkbox\" \n                checked={item.selected}\n                onChange={() => {}} // Let parent div handle it\n                onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} // Prevent double-firing\n            />\n            <span>{item.name}</span>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Multiple Checkboxes**\nFor multiple checkboxes, use an object or array:\n\n```jsx\nconst [selections, setSelections] = useState({\n    option1: false,\n    option2: false,\n    option3: false\n});\n\nconst handleChange = (name) => (e) => {\n    setSelections(prev => ({\n        ...prev,\n        [name]: e.target.checked\n    }));\n};\n```\n\n### Key Best Practices Summary:\n\n| Practice | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Event Handler | Use `onChange`, not `onClick` |\n| Label Association | Use `htmlFor`

How to Handle React onClick Interaction for Checkbox Labels and Inputs in 2026\n\nBased on current best practices, here's a comprehensive guide for handling React checkbox interactions:\n\n### 1. **Use `onChange` Instead of `onClick` for Checkboxes**\nThe recommended approach is to use the `onChange` event handler rather than `onClick` for checkbox inputs:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction CheckboxExample() {\n    const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n    return (\n        <label>\n            <input \n                type=\"checkbox\" \n                checked={isChecked} \n                onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)} \n            />\n            Subscribe to updates\n        </label>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Proper Label Association with `htmlFor`**\nIn React, use `htmlFor` (not `for`) to associate labels with checkboxes:\n\n```jsx\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"myCheckbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n<label htmlFor=\"myCheckbox\">Click me to toggle</label>\n```\n\nThis ensures clicking the label also toggles the checkbox.\n\n### 3. **Controlled Components (Recommended)**\nAlways use controlled components where React manages the checkbox state:\n\n```jsx\nconst [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);\n\n<input \n    type=\"checkbox\" \n    checked={checked}           // Controlled by React state\n    onChange={(e) => setChecked(e.target.checked)} \n/>\n```\n\n### 4. **Handling Container `onClick` with Checkbox**\nIf you have a clickable container wrapping a checkbox, avoid event conflicts:\n\n```jsx\nfunction ClickableRow({ item, onToggle }) {\n    return (\n        <div onClick={() => onToggle(item.id)}>\n            <input \n                type=\"checkbox\" \n                checked={item.selected}\n                onChange={() => {}} // Let parent div handle it\n                onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} // Prevent double-firing\n            />\n            <span>{item.name}</span>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Multiple Checkboxes**\nFor multiple checkboxes, use an object or array:\n\n```jsx\nconst [selections, setSelections] = useState({\n    option1: false,\n    option2: false,\n    option3: false\n});\n\nconst handleChange = (name) => (e) => {\n    setSelections(prev => ({\n        ...prev,\n        [name]: e.target.checked\n    }));\n};\n```\n\n### Key Best Practices Summary:\n\n| Practice | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Event Handler | Use `onChange`, not `onClick` |\n| Label Association | Use `htmlFor`

Use `e.preventDefault()` if handling clicks separately.\n\n### Best Practices Summary\n\n| Practice | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| State Management | Use controlled components with `checked` + `onChange` |\n| Label Association | Use `htmlFor` attribute (not `for`) |\n| Multiple Checkboxes | Store in object `{ key: boolean }` or array |\n| Accessibility | Always provide meaningful labels |\n| Event Handling | Prefer `onChange` over `onClick` for checkbox state |\n| Form Libraries | Consider React Hook Form or Formik for complex forms |\n\n### Modern Pattern with Custom Hook (2026)\n\n```jsx\nfunction useCheckbox(initialValue = false) {\n  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(initialValue);\n  \n  const toggle = () => setChecked(prev => !prev);\n  const bind = {\n    checked,\n    onChange: (e) => setChecked(e.target.checked)\n  };\n  \n  return [checked, toggle, bind];\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction App() {\n  const [isSubscribed, toggleSubscribe, subscribeProps] = useCheckbox(false);\n  \n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" {...subscribeProps} />\n      Subscribe to newsletter\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe key takeaway: **Use `onChange` for checkbox state changes** rather than `onClick`, and always use `htmlFor` (not `for`) when associating labels with inputs in React.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","timestamp":31052},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":31052},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GtP586KRJmDDCjPZJ15yjc","status":"completed","timestamp":31052},{"type":"message","content":"## Handling React onClick Interaction for Checkbox Labels and Inputs in 2026\n\nBased on the latest best practices, here's how to handle React `onClick` interaction for checkbox labels and inputs:\n\n### Key Approaches\n\n#### 1. **Use `htmlFor` Attribute (Most Important)**\nIn React, use `htmlFor` instead of `for` to link labels to checkboxes:\n\n```jsx\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"myCheckbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n<label htmlFor=\"myCheckbox\">Click me to toggle</label>\n```\n\n#### 2. **Controlled Components (Recommended)**\nManage checkbox state through React state for predictable behavior:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction CheckboxExample() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setIsChecked(e.target.checked);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        id=\"terms\"\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={handleChange}\n      />\n      <label htmlFor=\"terms\">I agree to the terms</label>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. **Wrapping Input Inside Label (Alternative)**\nYou can wrap the input inside the label, eliminating the need for `id`/`htmlFor`:\n\n```jsx\n<label>\n  <input\n    type=\"checkbox\"\n    checked={isChecked}\n    onChange={handleChange}\n  />\n  Accept terms and conditions\n</label>\n```\n\n#### 4. **Handling onClick on Labels (When Needed)**\nIf you need explicit `onClick` handling on the label:\n\n```jsx\nconst handleLabelClick = (e) => {\n  // Prevent double-firing when clicking label\n  // (label click triggers both onClick and input's onChange)\n  e.preventDefault();\n  setIsChecked(prev => !prev);\n};\n\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <input\n      type=\"checkbox\"\n      id=\"custom\"\n      checked={isChecked}\n      onChange={handleChange}\n    />\n    <label htmlFor=\"custom\" onClick={handleLabelClick}>\n      Custom label click\n    </label>\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\n**Note:** Be careful with `onClick` on labels—it can cause double-toggling since clicking the label also triggers the input's `onChange`.

Go to **Image → Scale Image** in the top menu\n3. In the Scale Image dialog, look for the **chain icon** (🔗) located between the Width and Height fields\n4. **Ensure the chain is linked/connected** (chains appear joined together)\n5.

Click **Scale** to apply\n\n### Method 2: Scale Tool (for layers)\n1. Select the **Scale Tool** from the toolbox (or press **Shift+S**)\n2. In the Tool Options, ensure the chain icon is **linked**\n3. Click on your image/layer to display scaling handles\n4. Drag the handles to resize - the aspect ratio will be preserved\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Chain linked** = aspect ratio is locked (proportions maintained)\n- **Chain broken** = width and height can be changed independently (may cause distortion)\n- You can click the chain icon to toggle between linked and unlinked states\n- For web images, set resolution to **72 ppi**; for print, use **300 ppi**\n- Use **Cubic** interpolation for best quality results\n\n### Pro Tip:\nYou can also use mathematical expressions in the dimension fields. For example, to set a 4:3 ratio with 1080 height, enter `1080*4/3` in the width field.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I use the chain icon in GIMP to keep the aspect ratio when scaling an image in 2026?","timestamp":22521},{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about using the chain icon in GIMP for maintaining aspect ratio when scaling.","timestamp":22521},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":22521},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KkuWNasRGP1iMsQ2uXwZyv","status":"completed","timestamp":22521},{"type":"message","content":"## Using the Chain Icon in GIMP to Keep Aspect Ratio When Scaling\n\nHere's how to use the chain icon in GIMP to maintain your image's aspect ratio:\n\n### Method 1: Scale Image Dialog (Recommended)\n1. **Open your image** in GIMP\n2.

To get all 2026 data, loop through pages until you reach records before 2026.\n\n3. **Rate Limits:** HTX has API rate limits. Implement delays between requests if fetching large amounts of data.\n\n4. **Funding Rate Updates (as of Jan 2024):** HTX switched to real-time funding rates. The `estimated_rate` and `next_funding_time` fields in current funding rate endpoints now return `null`.\n\n5. **Contract Codes:**\n   - USDT-margined: `BTC-USDT`, `ETH-USDT`, etc.\n   - Coin-margined: `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`, etc.","timestamp":46607}],"duration":46607,"pass":true,"score":0.98,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

Here's how it works:\n\n### Core Concept\n\nThe attacker loads a legitimate \"decoy\" DLL into a target process's memory space, then overwrites portions of that DLL (typically the entry point or exported functions) with malicious shellcode. The shellcode then executes from what appears to be a trusted Windows module.\n\n### Why Use LoadLibraryEx with DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES?\n\nThe key innovation is using `LoadLibraryEx` with the `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` flag (0x00000001) instead of regular `LoadLibrary`. This is critical because:\n\n1. **Regular LoadLibrary** calls `DllMain` with `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`, and for every thread created/destroyed, `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH`/`DLL_THREAD_DETACH` fire - causing shellcode at the entry point to execute multiple times and crash the process\n\n2. **LoadLibraryEx with DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES** loads the DLL but:\n   - Does **NOT** process the DLL's import table\n   - Does **NOT** call DllMain\n   - Provides stable memory regions for shellcode injection\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n**1. Target Process Selection**\n- Create a new process (e.g., notepad.exe) or open a handle to an existing process\n- Often combined with PPID spoofing to make the malicious process appear as a child of a trusted parent (e.g., explorer.exe)\n\n**2. DLL Selection**\n- Choose a legitimate DLL that is larger than the shellcode (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `xpsservices.dll`, `d3d9.dll`)\n- The DLL should not already be loaded in the target process\n\n**3. Remote LoadLibraryEx Injection**\nSince `CreateRemoteThread` can only pass one argument (the DLL path), but `LoadLibraryEx` needs three arguments, attackers use a small \"shim\" shellcode:\n\n```asm\n; x64 shim (22 bytes)\nmov rax, <LoadLibraryExA_address>  ; Patched at runtime\nmov r8, 1                           ; DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES flag\nxor rdx, rdx                        ; hReservedNull = 0\njmp rax                             ; Jump to LoadLibraryExA\n```\n\n**4. Locate Injection Point**\nAfter the DLL loads, find the target memory location:\n- **Entry Point**: Parse the MZ/PE headers to find `AddressOfEntryPoint`\n- **Exported Functions**: Use `GetProcAddress` on functions like `DllCanUnloadNow`\n\n```c\n// Parse PE headers to find entry point\nPIMAGE_DOS_HEADER mzHeader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)hTargetDLL;\nPIMAGE_NT_HEADERS peHeader = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((char*)hTargetDLL + mzHeader->e_lfanew);\nvoid* entryPoint = (void*)((char*)hTargetDLL + peHeader->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);\n```\n\n**5.

Here's how it works:\n\n### Core Concept\n\nThe attacker loads a legitimate \"decoy\" DLL into a target process's memory space, then overwrites portions of that DLL (typically the entry point or exported functions) with malicious shellcode. The shellcode then executes from what appears to be a trusted Windows module.\n\n### Why Use LoadLibraryEx with DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES?\n\nThe key innovation is using `LoadLibraryEx` with the `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` flag (0x00000001) instead of regular `LoadLibrary`. This is critical because:\n\n1. **Regular LoadLibrary** calls `DllMain` with `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`, and for every thread created/destroyed, `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH`/`DLL_THREAD_DETACH` fire - causing shellcode at the entry point to execute multiple times and crash the process\n\n2. **LoadLibraryEx with DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES** loads the DLL but:\n   - Does **NOT** process the DLL's import table\n   - Does **NOT** call DllMain\n   - Provides stable memory regions for shellcode injection\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n**1. Target Process Selection**\n- Create a new process (e.g., notepad.exe) or open a handle to an existing process\n- Often combined with PPID spoofing to make the malicious process appear as a child of a trusted parent (e.g., explorer.exe)\n\n**2. DLL Selection**\n- Choose a legitimate DLL that is larger than the shellcode (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `xpsservices.dll`, `d3d9.dll`)\n- The DLL should not already be loaded in the target process\n\n**3. Remote LoadLibraryEx Injection**\nSince `CreateRemoteThread` can only pass one argument (the DLL path), but `LoadLibraryEx` needs three arguments, attackers use a small \"shim\" shellcode:\n\n```asm\n; x64 shim (22 bytes)\nmov rax, <LoadLibraryExA_address>  ; Patched at runtime\nmov r8, 1                           ; DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES flag\nxor rdx, rdx                        ; hReservedNull = 0\njmp rax                             ; Jump to LoadLibraryExA\n```\n\n**4. Locate Injection Point**\nAfter the DLL loads, find the target memory location:\n- **Entry Point**: Parse the MZ/PE headers to find `AddressOfEntryPoint`\n- **Exported Functions**: Use `GetProcAddress` on functions like `DllCanUnloadNow`\n\n```c\n// Parse PE headers to find entry point\nPIMAGE_DOS_HEADER mzHeader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)hTargetDLL;\nPIMAGE_NT_HEADERS peHeader = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((char*)hTargetDLL + mzHeader->e_lfanew);\nvoid* entryPoint = (void*)((char*)hTargetDLL + peHeader->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);\n```\n\n**5. Write Shellcode**\n```c\nVirtualProtect(entryPoint, shellcode_size, PAGE_READWRITE, &oldProtect);\nmemcpy(entryPoint, shellcode, shellcode_size);\nVirtualProtect(entryPoint, shellcode_size, oldProtect, &oldProtect);\n```\n\n**6. Execute**\n```c\nCreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, entryPoint, NULL, 0, NULL);\n// Or use QueueUserAPC for stealthier execution\n```\n\n### Why This Evades Detection\n\n1. **No suspicious RWX allocations**: Shellcode runs from an existing DLL's memory region, not newly allocated executable memory\n2. **Legitimate module appearance**: Memory scanners see shellcode associated with a trusted Windows DLL\n3. **Thread origin masking**: Thread call stacks show execution originating from legitimate modules\n4. **No new modules loaded**: The DLL is a standard Windows component\n\n### Modern Evasion Improvements (2024)\n\n- **Phantom DLL Hollowing**: Uses `NtCreateSection` with `SEC_IMAGE` to create file-backed sections, making memory regions appear even more legitimate\n- **Module Shifting**: Restores original DLL bytes after shellcode completes to eliminate \"Modified Code\" indicators\n- **Module Overloading**: Maps DLLs with `READONLY` access to avoid write permission artifacts\n- **Combination with syscalls**: Replacing PInvoke calls with direct syscalls to bypass EDR hooks\n\n### Detection Indicators\n\n- Legitimate DLLs loaded in processes that don't normally use them\n- Modified code sections in loaded modules (comparing memory to disk)\n- Unusual thread start addresses within DLL code sections\n- `LoadLibraryEx` calls with `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` flag","timestamp":54046}],"duration":54046,"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

A dedicated plugin that creates Figma nodes directly from JSON structures:\n- Install from Figma Community: `figma.com/community/plugin/1396123287818850149`\n- Supports local JSON files and fetching from URLs\n- Populates layers with text and images (JPG, PNG, WEBP, SVG, GIF)\n\n**Populate Plugin** (2026) -

Create/update design tokens from JSON\n- **Design Tokens Manager** - Import/export Figma Variables to JSON\n\n### Example JSON Structure for Import:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Card Component\",\n  \"type\": \"FRAME\",\n  \"width\": 320,\n  \"height\": 200,\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"content\": \"Title\",\n      \"fontSize\": 24\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"RECTANGLE\",\n      \"width\": 300,\n      \"height\": 100,\n      \"fill\": \"#FFFFFF\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Key Resources:\n- **Figma Plugin API Docs**: `developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/`\n- **createFrame method**: `figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createframe`\n- **Node tree structure**: Access via `figma.currentPage` and traverse children\n\nThe simplest approach is to use the **JSON to Figma** community plugin for immediate use, or build a custom plugin with `createNodeFromJSXAsync` for complex, automated imports.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","timestamp":32894},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":32894},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KAwzLFaMVgbJZUm2NZMniQ","status":"completed","timestamp":32894},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's how you can use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026:\n\n## Methods to Create Figma Nodes from JSON\n\n### 1. **Use Existing Plugins**\n\n**JSON to Figma Import Plugin**\n- Available at: `figma.com/community/plugin/1396123287818850149/json-to-figma-import`\n- Creates Figma nodes directly from JSON structures\n- Automates node creation using the Figma API\n\n**JSON to Figma Plugin** (by Pavel Laptev)\n- Available at: `figma.com/community/plugin/789839703871161985/json-to-figma`\n- Supports loading local JSON files or fetching from URLs\n- Populates layers with text and images (JPG, PNG, WEBP, SVG, GIF)\n- Parses complex nested JSON structures\n\n### 2. **Build Your Own Plugin Using the Figma API**\n\nIf you need custom functionality, use these Figma Plugin API methods:\n\n#### **Method A: `createNodeFromJSXAsync`** (Recommended for bulk creation)\n```typescript\n// Install typings: npm i --save-dev @figma/widget-typings\n\n// tsconfig.json settings:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"jsxFactory\": \"figma.widget.h\",\n    \"jsxFragmentFactory\": \"figma.widget.Fragment\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Rename code.ts to code.tsx, then:\nconst node = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(\n  <AutoLayout>\n    <Image src={imageData} />\n    <Text>Hello World</Text>\n  </AutoLayout>\n);\n```\n\n#### **Method B: Standard Node Creation Methods**\n```typescript\n// Parse your JSON structure\nconst jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n\n// Create nodes based on JSON\nfunction createNodesFromJSON(data) {\n  const frame = figma.createFrame();\n  frame.resize(data.width, data.height);\n  frame.name = data.name;\n  \n  // Create child nodes\n  for (const child of data.children) {\n    if (child.type === 'TEXT') {\n      const text = figma.createText();\n      text.characters = child.content;\n      frame.appendChild(text);\n    } else if (child.type === 'RECTANGLE') {\n      const rect = figma.createRectangle();\n      rect.resize(child.width, child.height);\n      frame.appendChild(rect);\n    }\n    // ... handle other node types\n  }\n  \n  return frame;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Design Tokens Approach**\n\nFor design system workflows, use:\n- **Tokens Studio** -

Attackers use:\n- **Residential proxies** that route through real home IP addresses (market reached $1.11B+ in 2024)\n- **Mobile proxies** that leverage legitimate cellular networks\n- **AI-powered automation** that mimics human behavior patterns\n- **Browser fingerprint spoofing** to evade detection\n\n---\n\n### Multi-Layered Detection Strategies\n\n#### 1. **Advanced IP Intelligence & Reputation Analysis**\n- **IP categorization**: Distinguish between datacenter, residential, mobile, and VPN IPs\n- **ASN (Autonomous System Number) analysis**: Flag IPs from known proxy provider networks\n- **Reverse DNS lookups**: Identify suspicious patterns in DNS records\n- **IP reputation databases**: Use services like IPinfo, Fraudlogix, or MaxMind that specialize in residential proxy detection\n- **Monitor for Ipidea-style networks** (Google disrupted one used by 550+ threat groups in January 2026)\n\n#### 2. **TLS/SSL Fingerprinting**\n- Analyze TLS handshake parameters (cipher suites, extensions, curves)\n- Detect mismatches between claimed browser/OS and actual TLS fingerprint\n- Tools like JA3/JA4 fingerprinting can identify automated clients even through proxies\n- Flag connections where TLS fingerprint doesn't match the claimed User-Agent\n\n#### 3. **Browser & Device Fingerprinting**\n- Collect canvas, WebGL, audio context fingerprints\n- Detect inconsistencies in:\n  - Screen resolution vs. viewport size\n  - Timezone vs. IP geolocation\n  - Language settings vs. claimed location\n  - Hardware concurrency and device memory\n- Identify anti-detect browsers (Multilogin, GoLogin, Camoufox) through fingerprint anomalies\n\n#### 4. **Behavioral Analysis & Machine Learning**\n- **Mouse movement patterns**: Bots often show linear, robotic movements\n- **Keystroke dynamics**: Analyze typing patterns for authenticity\n- **Navigation flow analysis**: Real users don't navigate perfectly to targets\n- **Session timing**: Detect superhuman speed or unnaturally consistent timing\n- **Click patterns**: Identify mechanical clicking behavior\n- **Shopee specifically uses reinforcement learning algorithms** that continuously adapt to new bot patterns\n\n#### 5. **Rate Limiting & Request Pattern Detection**\n- Implement adaptive rate limiting based on:\n  - Requests per IP over time windows\n  - Request velocity across related IPs (same subnet/ASN)\n  - Session-based rate limits\n- Detect distributed attacks by correlating patterns across multiple IPs\n- Flag rapid succession of requests from different IPs to the same resources\n\n---\n\n### Prevention Mechanisms\n\n#### 1. **Intelligent CAPTCHA Implementation**\n- Deploy progressive challenges (Cloudflare Turnstile, HUMAN, reCAPTCHA v3)\n- Use risk-based CAPTCHA triggers (not on every request)\n- Implement invisible challenges that don't disrupt legitimate users\n- Combine with device attestation (Apple DeviceCheck, Android SafetyNet)\n\n#### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n- Enforce MFA for high-risk actions (checkout, account changes)\n- Use phone verification (like Shopee's mandatory login wall)\n- Implement hardware security key support\n- Deploy time-based OTP for sensitive operations\n\n#### 3. **Session Integrity & Token Management**\n- Generate cryptographic session tokens tied to device fingerprint\n- Implement session binding to prevent token theft\n- Use short-lived tokens with frequent rotation\n- Detect session anomalies (sudden location/device changes)\n\n#### 4. **Dynamic Content & Anti-Scraping Measures**\n- Randomize DOM structure and CSS class names\n- Implement dynamic header generation with cryptographic tokens\n- Use JavaScript-based content rendering\n- Deploy honeypot fields and invisible links to trap bots\n\n#### 5. **Network-Level Defenses**\n- Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAF) with bot detection modules\n- Use CDN providers with built-in bot management (Cloudflare, Akamai, Peakhour)\n- Implement geofencing for region-specific restrictions\n- Block known malicious ASNs and datacenter IP ranges\n\n---\n\n### Real-Time Monitoring & Response\n\n| Signal | Action |\n|--------|--------|\n| High request rate from new IP | Progressive rate limiting |\n| Residential proxy detection | Increased friction (CAPTCHA) |\n| Fingerprint mismatch | Risk score elevation |\n| Behavioral anomaly | Session termination + verification |\n| Known bad ASN/IP | Immediate block |\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Layer your defenses**: No single technique is sufficient; combine IP intelligence, fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, and challenges\n\n2. **Balance security with UX**: Implement \"legitimacy by default\" - only add friction when risk signals appear\n\n3. **Continuously adapt**: Attackers evolve; update detection rules and ML models regularly\n\n4. **Monitor false positive rates**: Blocking legitimate customers causes revenue loss\n\n5. **Use specialized services**: Consider platforms like:\n   - Peakhour (residential proxy detection + bot management)\n   - IPinfo (advanced IP intelligence)\n   - HUMAN (bot detection)\n   - Cloudflare (comprehensive protection)\n\n6. **Mobile app security**: Shopee's mobile APIs may have different vulnerabilities; implement certificate pinning and app attestation\n\n---\n\n### Key Statistics to Consider\n- Over 80% of large websites deploy proxy detection, but only 15% have specific residential proxy protections\n- Successful residential proxy detection can reduce fraud by 85%\n- Bot traffic continues to constitute 30%+ of internet traffic, with significant malicious components\n- Click fraud alone costs advertisers $100B+ annually\n\nThe most effective approach combines **real-time IP intelligence**, **behavioral biometrics**, **device fingerprinting**, and **adaptive challenges** while maintaining a seamless experience for legitimate users.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":48506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":48506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01R3xYNNWYWMsYCyYzVeLZAs","status":"completed","timestamp":48506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BDQyT3AvH8KTWYbexbwX7F","status":"completed","timestamp":48506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018xEJrTNYqQEAEAsWYbgaBb","status":"completed","timestamp":48506},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive research, here is a detailed guide on **detecting and preventing proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Detecting and Preventing Proxy Rotation Attacks on E-Commerce Platforms (2026)\n\n### Understanding the Threat Landscape\n\nProxy rotation attacks in 2026 have become highly sophisticated.

Custom Color Palette Configuration\n\n### For Tailwind CSS v4 (Latest - 2024/2025)\n\nTailwind v4 introduces a **CSS-first approach** using the `@theme` directive:\n\n```css\n/* In your main CSS file (e.g., app.css) */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  --color-brand-50: #f0f9ff;\n  --color-brand-100: #e0f2fe;\n  --color-brand-200: #bae6fd;\n  --color-brand-300: #7dd3fc;\n  --color-brand-400: #38bdf8;\n  --color-brand-500: #0ea5e9;\n  --color-brand-600: #0284c7;\n  --color-brand-700: #0369a1;\n  --color-brand-800: #075985;\n  --color-brand-900: #0c4a6e;\n  --color-brand-950: #082f49;\n  \n  --color-accent: #ff6b6b;\n  --color-success: #10b981;\n  --color-warning: #f59e0b;\n  --color-error: #ef4444;\n}\n```\n\n### For Tailwind CSS v3 (Still widely used)\n\nConfigure in `tailwind.config.js`:\n\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        // Custom brand colors with shades\n        brand: {\n          50: '#f0f9ff',\n          100: '#e0f2fe',\n          200: '#bae6fd',\n          300: '#7dd3fc',\n          400: '#38bdf8',\n          500: '#0ea5e9',  // Primary brand color\n          600: '#0284c7',\n          700: '#0369a1',\n          800: '#075985',\n          900: '#0c4a6e',\n          950: '#082f49',\n        },\n        // Single custom colors\n        accent: '#ff6b6b',\n        success: '#10b981',\n        warning: '#f59e0b',\n        error: '#ef4444',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  // For dark mode support\n  darkMode: 'class',\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Mobile-First Responsive Design\n\nTailwind CSS uses a **mobile-first approach by default**. Styles without breakpoint prefixes apply to all screen sizes, and you add prefixes for larger screens.\n\n### Default Breakpoints:\n| Prefix | Min Width | CSS |\n|--------|-----------|-----|\n| (none) | 0px | Base mobile styles |\n| `sm:` | ≥640px | Small devices |\n| `md:` | ≥768px | Medium devices |\n| `lg:` | ≥1024px | Large devices |\n| `xl:` | ≥1280px | Extra large |\n| `2xl:` | ≥1536px | 2X Extra large |\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```html\n<!-- Mobile-first responsive card with custom colors -->\n<div class=\"\n  bg-brand-50 \n  p-4 \n  sm:p-6 \n  md:p-8 \n  lg:p-10\n  text-brand-900\n  dark:bg-brand-900\n  dark:text-brand-50\n\">\n  <h2 class=\"\n    text-lg \n    sm:text-xl \n    md:text-2xl \n    lg:text-3xl\n    text-brand-700\n    dark:text-brand-200\n  \">\n    Responsive Heading\n  </h2>\n  \n  <button class=\"\n    w-full \n    md:w-auto\n    bg-brand-500 \n    hover:bg-brand-600 \n    text-white \n    px-4 py-2\n    rounded\n  \">\n    Click Me\n  </button>\n</div>\n```\n\n## 3. Custom Breakpoints (Optional)\n\n### Tailwind v4:\n```css\n@theme {\n  --breakpoint-xs: 475px;\n  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;\n}\n```\n\n### Tailwind v3:\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    screens: {\n      'xs': '475px',\n      'sm': '640px',\n      'md': '768px',\n      'lg': '1024px',\n      'xl': '1280px',\n      '2xl': '1536px',\n      '3xl': '1920px',\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Container Queries (Tailwind v4)\n\nFor component-based responsive design:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"@container\">\n  <div class=\"@sm:flex @lg:grid @lg:grid-cols-3\">\n    <!-- Responds to container size, not viewport -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## 5. Best Practices\n\n1. **Start mobile-first**: Write base styles without prefixes, then add `sm:`, `md:`, etc.\n2. **Use semantic color names**: `brand`, `accent`, `success` instead of `blue`, `red`\n3. **Create consistent shade scales**: 50-950 range for flexibility\n4. **Leverage CSS variables**: For dynamic theming and dark mode\n5. **Test on real devices**: Ensure colors and layouts work across screen sizes\n\nThis setup gives you a flexible, maintainable color system that works seamlessly with Tailwind's mobile-first responsive utilities.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","timestamp":36280},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":36280},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Smc8fQGHWejibR5LkNQZ7Y","status":"completed","timestamp":36280},{"type":"message","content":"# How to Set Up a Custom Color Palette for Mobile-First Responsive Design in Tailwind CSS (2024-2025)\n\nBased on the latest documentation and best practices, here's a comprehensive guide:\n\n## 1.

Here's how to set it up:\n\n### 1. Add Dependencies to `Cargo.toml`\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.56\", features = [\"relay\", \"tcp\", \"noise\", \"yamux\", \"tokio\"] }\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\n```\n\n### 2. Create Relay Client and Transport\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    core::transport::OrTransport,\n    relay,\n    swarm::{Swarm, SwarmBuilder},\n    tcp, noise, yamux,\n    Multiaddr, PeerId, Transport,\n    multiaddr::Protocol,\n};\n\n// Create the relay client transport and behaviour\nlet local_peer_id = /* your local PeerId */;\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n\n// Combine with your actual transport (e.g., TCP)\nlet tcp_transport = tcp::tokio::Transport::default();\nlet transport = OrTransport::new(relay_transport, tcp_transport)\n    .upgrade(libp2p::core::upgrade::Version::V1)\n    .authenticate(noise::Config::new(/* keypair */).unwrap())\n    .multiplex(yamux::Config::default())\n    .boxed();\n```\n\n### 3. Dialing Through a Relay\n\nTo dial a destination peer through a relay, construct a **circuit address** with the `/p2p-circuit` protocol:\n\n```rust\n// Build the relay circuit address\nlet relay_peer_id: PeerId = /* relay node's peer ID */;\nlet destination_peer_id: PeerId = /* destination peer's ID */;\n\nlet dst_addr_via_relay = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Ip4(\"1.2.3.4\".parse().unwrap()))  // Relay's IP\n    .with(Protocol::Tcp(4001))                         // Relay's port\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_peer_id))                // Relay's peer ID\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)                        // Signal: use relay\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_peer_id));         // Destination peer ID\n\n// Dial through the relay\nswarm.dial(dst_addr_via_relay)?;\n```\n\n### 4. Listening via a Relay\n\nTo receive incoming connections through a relay:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_addr = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Ip4(\"1.2.3.4\".parse().unwrap()))\n    .with(Protocol::Tcp(4001))\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_peer_id))\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit);  // No destination = listen mode\n\nswarm.listen_on(relay_addr)?;\n```\n\n### 5.

It should mention using compatible Composer constraints for `shetabit/visitor` and Laravel (e.g., via Packagist or Laravel Shift) and resolving the “laravel/framework replaces illuminate/support and thus cannot coexist with it” style conflict.

However, if you're encountering `illuminate/support` version constraint issues, here's how to fix them:\n\n## Solution for shetabit/visitor illuminate/support Version Constraint\n\n### 1. **Update to the Latest Version**\nThe latest version of `shetabit/visitor` (as of 2025-03-18) already supports Laravel 9.x through 12.x. Simply run:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor\n```\n\nOr update if already installed:\n```bash\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor\n```\n\n### 2. **If You're Still Getting Version Conflicts**\n\nIf the package constraints in your version are outdated, you have several options:\n\n#### Option A: Use `--with-all-dependencies` flag\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\n#### Option B: Check what's blocking the installation\n```bash\ncomposer why-not shetabit/visitor\n```\n\n#### Option C: Fork and modify `composer.json`\n\nIf you need to manually fix the constraint, the package's `composer.json` should have `illuminate/support` set like this:\n\n```json\n\"require\": {\n    \"php\": \">=8.0\",\n    \"illuminate/support\": \"^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\"\n}\n```\n\nThe key constraint that supports Laravel 10, 11, and 12 is:\n```\n\"illuminate/support\": \"^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\"\n```\n\n#### Option D: Override with inline alias (temporary fix)\nIf you need to force compatibility temporarily:\n```bash\ncomposer require \"shetabit/visitor:*\" --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\n### 3. **Common Causes of This Issue**\n\n- **Outdated composer.lock**: Run `composer update` instead of `composer install`\n- **Cached packages**: Clear composer cache with `composer clear-cache`\n- **Old package version**: Specify a newer version explicitly like `composer require shetabit/visitor:^4.0`\n\n### Summary\n\nThe package officially supports Laravel 10, 11, and 12 as of its latest release. If you're having issues, it's likely due to:\n1. An outdated cached version\n2. Another package creating a conflict\n3.

Simply run:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor\n```\n\nOr update if already installed:\n```bash\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor\n```\n\n### 2. **If You're Still Getting Version Conflicts**\n\nIf the package constraints in your version are outdated, you have several options:\n\n#### Option A: Use `--with-all-dependencies` flag\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\n#### Option B: Check what's blocking the installation\n```bash\ncomposer why-not shetabit/visitor\n```\n\n#### Option C: Fork and modify `composer.json`\n\nIf you need to manually fix the constraint, the package's `composer.json` should have `illuminate/support` set like this:\n\n```json\n\"require\": {\n    \"php\": \">=8.0\",\n    \"illuminate/support\": \"^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\"\n}\n```\n\nThe key constraint that supports Laravel 10, 11, and 12 is:\n```\n\"illuminate/support\": \"^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\"\n```\n\n#### Option D: Override with inline alias (temporary fix)\nIf you need to force compatibility temporarily:\n```bash\ncomposer require \"shetabit/visitor:*\" --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\n### 3. **Common Causes of This Issue**\n\n- **Outdated composer.lock**: Run `composer update` instead of `composer install`\n- **Cached packages**: Clear composer cache with `composer clear-cache`\n- **Old package version**: Specify a newer version explicitly like `composer require shetabit/visitor:^4.0`\n\n### Summary\n\nThe package officially supports Laravel 10, 11, and 12 as of its latest release. If you're having issues, it's likely due to:\n1. An outdated cached version\n2. Another package creating a conflict\n3. An older version constraint in your existing `composer.lock`\n\nRun `composer update shetabit/visitor --with-all-dependencies` to resolve most cases.","timestamp":26952}],"duration":26952,"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

Establish data integrity checks throughout the pipeline to catch issues early\n- Ensure data standardization to reduce downstream problems\n\n## 2. **Automation & AI-Driven Processes**\n- Automate repetitive ETL tasks to reduce manual errors and increase efficiency\n- Leverage AI tools for intelligent automation of transformations and anomaly detection\n- Use modern orchestration tools (like dbt, Airflow) for consistent, automated workflows\n\n## 3. **Scalability by Design**\n- Design pipelines to handle increasing data volumes without performance degradation\n- Implement **dynamic resource allocation** (CPU, memory, storage) to prevent bottlenecks\n- Plan for scalability from the outset rather than retrofitting later\n\n## 4. **Real-Time Processing Capabilities**\n- Move beyond batch-only processing to support real-time data ingestion\n- Enable timely decision-making with streaming architectures where needed\n- Balance real-time vs. batch based on business requirements\n\n## 5. **ELT over Traditional ETL (in Cloud Environments)**\n- Load raw data first, then transform in the data warehouse (ELT pattern)\n- Take advantage of cloud data warehouse compute power for
