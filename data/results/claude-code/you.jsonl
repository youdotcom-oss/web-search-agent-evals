{"id":"search-3","input":"<web-search>Compare the current pricing of Anthropic's Claude API vs OpenAI's GPT-4 API in 2025</web-search>","output":"Based on the latest pricing information for 2025, here's a comprehensive comparison of Anthropic's Claude API vs OpenAI's GPT-4 API:\n\n## Flagship Models Comparison\n\n**Anthropic Claude:**\n- **Claude Opus 4.5**: $5 input / $25 output per 1M tokens (most capable)\n- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: $3 input / $15 output per 1M tokens (balanced performance)\n- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: $1 input / $5 output per 1M tokens (fastest, most efficient)\n\n**OpenAI GPT-4:**\n- **GPT-4o (Standard)**: $2.50 input / $10.00 output per 1M tokens\n- **GPT-4.1 (Standard)**: $2.00 input / $8.00 output per 1M tokens\n- **GPT-4o-mini (Standard)**: $0.15 input / $0.60 output per 1M tokens\n\n## Key Pricing Advantages\n\n### Anthropic Claude:\n- **67% price reduction** from previous generation (Opus 4.1 was $15/$75)\n- **Prompt caching**: 90% discount on cached reads ($0.30 per 1M tokens for Sonnet 4.5)\n- **Batch API**: 50% discount for async processing\n- **Extended thinking**: Built into output tokens, no separate charge\n- **Combined optimizations**: Can achieve 95% cost reduction with caching + batch processing\n\n### OpenAI GPT-4:\n- **Multiple pricing tiers**: Batch (50% off), Flex, Standard, Priority (2x standard)\n- **Prompt caching**: Available on select models (e.g., 4.1 cached input at $0.50/1M tokens)\n- **More affordable entry-level**: GPT-4o-mini at $0.15/$0.60 vs Haiku at $1/$5\n- **Specialized models**: Reasoning models (o3, o4-mini), audio, vision variants\n\n## Cost Examples\n\n**Standard Processing (1M input + 1M output tokens):**\n- Claude Sonnet 4.5: $18.00\n- GPT-4.1: $10.00\n- GPT-4o: $12.50\n\n**With Batch Processing (50% off both):**\n- Claude Sonnet 4.5: $1.50 input + $7.50 output = $9.00\n- GPT-4.1: $1.00 input + $4.00 output = $5.00\n- GPT-4o: $1.25 input + $5.00 output = $6.25\n\n**With Prompt Caching (200K cached context, 100 queries):**\n- Claude Sonnet 4.5: Initial $1.20 + 99 reads at $0.30 = ~$7.14 per hour\n- GPT-4.1: Cached input at $0.50 per 1M tokens\n\n## Notable Features\n\n**Claude Advantages:**\n- Up to 1M token context window (Sonnet 4.5)\n- 200K standard context on all models\n- Extended thinking mode for complex reasoning\n- Aggressive caching discounts (90% savings)\n\n**OpenAI Advantages:**\n- Lower-cost entry model (GPT-4o-mini)\n- Multiple processing tiers for flexibility\n- Specialized models (o-series for reasoning, audio, vision)\n- Real-time and audio models available\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**For standard workloads**: OpenAI's GPT-4.1 ($2/$8) and GPT-4o ($2.50/$10) are generally more cost-effective than Claude Sonnet 4.5 ($3/$15) and Opus 4.5 ($5/$25).\n\n**For high-volume with caching**: Claude's 90% prompt caching discount can make it significantly cheaper for applications with repeated context (RAG systems, code assistants, document analysis).\n\n**For entry-level/high-volume**: OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini at $0.15/$0.60 is substantially cheaper than Claude Haiku 4.5 at $1/$5.\n\n**For flagship intelligence**: Claude Opus 4.5 at $5/$25 offers premium capabilities at a competitive price point, especially after the 67% price reduction from previous generation.\n\nSources:\n- [Anthropic Claude API Pricing 2026: Complete Cost Breakdown
