{"id":"websearch-1745","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use vite-plugin-vue-cron with Vue 3 and Element Plus in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use vite-plugin-vue-cron with Vue 3 and Element Plus in 2026\nWhile there isn't a package named `vite-plugin-vue-cron\n`, the modern and correct way to integrate a cron job UI into a Vue 3 and Element Plus application is by using the\n `@vue-js-cron/element-plus` component library. This library provides a user-friendly interface for generating\n cron expressions.\n\nHere is a guide on how to use it in your 2026 project:\n\n### \n1. Installation\n\nFirst, add the library to your project using your preferred package manager.\n\n\n```bash\n# Using\n npm\nnpm install @vue-js-cron/element-plus\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn add @vue-js\n-cron/element-plus\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Global Registration\n\nFor ease of use, you can register the component\n globally in your application's entry file (`main.js` or `main.ts`). This makes it available in any\n of your components without needing to import it every time.\n\n**`main.ts`**\n\n\n```typescript\nimport\n { createApp } from 'vue'\nimport App from './App.vue'\nimport ElementPlus from 'element-plus'\n\nimport 'element-plus/dist/index.css'\n\n// 1. Import the plugin and its styles\n\nimport CronElementPlusPlugin from '@vue-js-cron/element-plus'\nimport '@vue-js-cron/element\n-plus/dist/element-plus.css'\n\nconst app = createApp(App)\n\napp.use(Element\nPlus)\n\n// 2. Register the plugin\napp.use(CronElementPlusPlugin)\n\napp.mount('#app\n')\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Usage in a Component\n\nNow you can use the `<cron-element-plus\n>` component directly in your Vue templates. You can bind the cron expression to a data property using `v-model`.\n\n\n**`components/Scheduler.vue`**\n\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <el-card>\n    <\ntemplate #header>\n      <div class=\"card-header\">\n        <span>Cron Job Scheduler</span>\n      </div>\n    </\ntemplate>\n\n    <div class=\"cron-container\">\n      <p>Schedule your task:</p>\n\n      <cron-element-plus v-model=\"cronExpression\" />\n      <p class=\"cron-output\n\">\n        Current Cron Value: <strong>{{ cronExpression }}</strong>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <\nel-divider />\n\n    <el-form label-width=\"120px\">\n      <el-form-item\n label=\"Cron Expression\">\n        <el-input v-model=\"cronExpression\" placeholder=\"Cron expression\" />\n      \n</el-form-item>\n      <el-form-item>\n        <el-button type=\"primary\">Schedule\n Task</el-button>\n      </el-form-item>\n    </el-form>\n\n  </\nel-card>\n</template>\n\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\n\n// The cron expression is stored in this ref\nconst cronExpression = ref('* * * * *')\n</script>\n\n\n<style scoped>\n.cron-container {\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n\n.cron-output {\n  margin-top: 15px;\n  padding: 10px;\n\n  background-color: #f4f4f5;\n  border: 1px solid #e9\ne9eb;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n}\n</style>\n\n```\n\n\n### Important\n Considerations for 2026:\n\n*   **Versioning:** By 2026, the library versions will\n likely be higher. Always check for the latest versions of `@vue-js-cron/element-plus`, `vue\n`, and `element-plus` to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features. The installation command above will fetch the latest\n version at the time of execution.\n*   **No Vite Plugin Needed:** This functionality is handled at the component level within\n your Vue application. It does not require a special Vite plugin. Vite's role is to build and serve your Vue components\n, and it does this without needing specific configuration for UI components like this one.\n*   **Backend Integration:** This component is a\n UI tool for creating cron *strings*. The generated string (`* * * * *`) needs to be sent to a backend server\n or a scheduling service (like node-cron, or a cloud provider's scheduling service) that will actually execute the scheduled\n tasks.","hint":"Answer must (1) identify `vite-plugin-vue-cron` as a Vite plugin that integrates a Vue cron expression UI (likely from `@vue-js-cron/element-plus`) into a Vue 3 project, and (2) describe, at least roughly, how to configure it in `vite.config.(ts|js)` alongside `@vitejs/plugin-vue` and Element Plus (e.g., adding the plugin to `plugins`, and importing/using the Element Plus cron component in Vue components). It should also mention compatibility with current (2026-ish) versions of Vite/Vue 3/Element Plus or warn about checking version compatibility and plugin maintenance status.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use vite-plugin-vue-cron with Vue 3 and Element Plus in 2026","timestamp":31652},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":31652},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770362841571-5eaac0aed26ae","status":"completed","timestamp":31652},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770362849611-ce211fcf96196","status":"completed","timestamp":31652},{"type":"message","content":"While there isn't a package named `vite-plugin-vue-cron","timestamp":31652},{"type":"message","content":"`, the modern and correct way to integrate a cron job UI into a Vue 3 and Element Plus application is by using the","timestamp":31652},{"type":"message","content":" `@vue-js-cron/element-plus` component library.

Based on current trends and the state-of-the-art, here are the best embedding models to consider,\n keeping in mind that the field is rapidly evolving.\n\n### The Go-To Resource: MTEB Leaderboard\n\nThe **\nMassive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)** is the industry standard for evaluating and comparing embedding models. For the most up-\nto-date rankings, you should always consult the [Hugging Face MTEB Leaderboard](https://hugging\nface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).\n\n### Top Contenders for November 2025\n\nHere\n are the models that are expected to be the top performers and most relevant for use with MLX on the M4 Max:\n\n\n#### 1. Overall Performance:\n\n*   **NVIDIA NV-Embed:** NVIDIA's models have consistently pushed\n the boundaries of performance, and their latest offerings are likely to be at or near the top of the MTEB leaderboard\n. Keep an eye out for MLX-optimized versions.\n*   **Voyage-3-large:** This\n model has shown exceptional performance in retrieval tasks and is a strong contender for the top spot.\n\n#### 2. Open-\nSource Champions:\n\n*   **Qwen Models (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding-2B):\n** The Qwen series of models from Alibaba Cloud have a strong track record of performance and are open-source. Their\n smaller, highly optimized models are an excellent choice for on-device deployment with MLX. The existence of projects like `qwen\n3-embeddings-mlx` indicates a strong community focus on MLX compatibility.\n*   **BGE (Beijing Academy\n of Artificial Intelligence General Embedding) and GTE (General Text Embedding) Models:** These models are consistently in the top tier\n of the MTEB leaderboard and are a popular choice for a wide range of tasks.\n*   **E5 Models\n:** Another family of high-performing, open-source models that are likely to have MLX-compatible versions available.\n\n\n#### 3. On-Device and MLX-Friendly:\n\n*   **Google's Gemma 3-\nbased Models (e.g., EmbeddingGemma-300M):** These models are specifically designed for high\n performance on local hardware. Their smaller footprint and optimization for on-device use make them a natural fit for MLX on the\n M4 Max.\n*   **Smaller Model Variants:** Many of the top-performing models are released in various sizes.\n For on-device use, smaller variants (e.g., 300M to 2B parameters) will\n offer the best balance of performance and efficiency on the M4 Max.\n\n### Key Trends to Watch in 202\n5\n\n*   **Multimodality:** If your use case involves more than just text (e.g., images, audio),\n you'll want to consider multimodal embedding models. This is a rapidly advancing area, and we can expect to see powerful open\n-source options by late 2025.\n*   **Specialization:** For specific domains like finance, medicine\n, or law, specialized models will likely outperform general-purpose models. Check the MTEB leaderboard for domain-specific rankings.\n\n*   **Quantization and Optimization:** To get the most out of the M4 Max, you'll want to\n use models that have been quantized (i.e., converted to a lower-precision format) and optimized for MLX. The\n MLX community is very active in this area, so look for models with \"mlx\" in their name on Hugging Face.\n\n\n### How to Choose the Best Model in November 2025\n\n1.  **Check the MTEB\n Leaderboard:** This should always be your first step.\n2.  **Consider Your Use Case:** Are you doing\n general-purpose text embedding, or do you have a specific domain or modality?\n3.  **Look for ML\nX Compatibility:** Search for models on Hugging Face with \"mlx\" in their name or check for community projects that provide conversion\n scripts.\n4.  **Benchmark on Your M4 Max:** The ultimate test is to benchmark the top 2-3 models\n on your own hardware and dataset to see which one performs best for your specific needs.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'\nll be well-equipped to select the best embedding model for your MLX project on the Apple Silicon M4 Max in\n November 2025.","hint":"A good answer should name several concrete embedding models known to run well with MLX on Apple Silicon (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding variants, Gemma 3–based embeddings, BERT/RoBERTa/XLM-R style encoders adapted to MLX, or community MLX-embedding models like those used in `mlx-retrieval` or `qwen3-embeddings-mlx`) and clearly state that these are current as of late 2025 while considering M4 Max hardware constraints (throughput, quantization/bit‑width, and memory use).

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026\nPyTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock\n when using multiprocessing due to how operating systems handle process creation and resource sharing, especially with libraries like PyTorch that manage their own thread\n pools and CUDA contexts. As of early 2026, the underlying causes and solutions remain consistent.\n\nHere's a\n breakdown of why it happens and how to fix it:\n\n### Why Deadlocks Happen\n\nThe primary culprit is often the use\n of the `fork` start method for multiprocessing, which is the default on Linux. When a process is forked, the\n child process gets a copy of the parent's memory space, including the state of all threads and locks. If a thread\n in the parent process holds a lock (e.g., during a CUDA operation or while using a multi-threaded library like\n MKL), that lock is copied to the child process in a locked state. The child process, however, does not inherit the thread\n that would release the lock, leading to a deadlock.\n\nLoading a model (`torch.load` or `model.load_state\n_dict`) can trigger this because it often involves CUDA context initialization or other thread-intensive operations.\n\n### How to Fix It\n\n\nHere are the most effective solutions, ordered by recommendation:\n\n**1. Change the Multiprocessing Start Method to\n `spawn` or `forkserver`**\n\nThis is the most recommended solution. Instead of copying the parent process,\n `spawn` and `forkserver` start a fresh Python interpreter process. This ensures that the child process starts with a clean\n slate, without any inherited locks or corrupted state.\n\nYou can set the start method at the beginning of your main script\n:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    \nmp.set_start_method('spawn') \n    # Your multiprocessing code here\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Load the\n Model Inside the Worker Process**\n\nA robust pattern is to instantiate and load the model *inside* the function that is\n executed by the worker process. This avoids sharing a model that has been initialized in the parent process.\n\nHere's an example\n using `torch.multiprocessing.spawn`:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nimport os\n\n# Define your model\nclass SimpleModel(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n\n        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()\n        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(1\n0, 1)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(x)\n\n\ndef worker_function(rank, world_size, model_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function is executed in\n a separate process.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Worker {rank}: Initializing and loading model.\")\n\n\n    # 1. Set up the process group (if doing distributed training)\n    # os.environ['MASTER\n_ADDR'] = 'localhost'\n    # os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '1235\n5'\n    # dist.init_process_group(\"gloo\", rank=rank, world_size=world_\nsize)\n\n    # 2. Instantiate the model in the worker\n    model = SimpleModel()\n\n    # 3.\n Load the state dictionary\n    map_location = f'cuda:{rank}' if torch.cuda.is_available() else '\ncpu'\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path, map_location=\nmap_location))\n    \n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        model.to(rank\n)\n\n    print(f\"Worker {rank}: Model loaded successfully.\")\n\n    # Your training/inference logic would go here\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Ensure the start method is set\n    mp.set_start_method\n('spawn', force=True)\n\n    # Save a dummy model for the example\n    model_path = \"\nsimple_model.pth\"\n    torch.save(SimpleModel().state_dict(), model_path)\n\n    \nworld_size = torch.cuda.device_count()\n    if world_size == 0:\n        world_size\n = 2 # fallback for CPU\n\n    print(\"Starting workers...\")\n    mp.spawn(worker_function,\n\n        args=(world_size, model_path),\n        nprocs=world_size,\n        join=True)\n\n    print(\"Workers finished.\")\n\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Use `DistributedDataParallel` for Multi-GPU Training**\n\n\nIf your goal is multi-GPU training, you should be using `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`.\n It is the recommended way to do multi-GPU training in PyTorch and is designed to handle the complexities of multiprocessing and\n data distribution, avoiding many common pitfalls.\n\n**4. Set `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`**\n\n\nPyTorch can use OpenMP for parallelism on the CPU. Sometimes this can conflict with Python's multiprocessing. Setting the environment\n variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to 1 can prevent these conflicts:\n\n\n```bash\nexport OMP_\nNUM_THREADS=1\npython your_script.py\n\n```\n\n\nYou can also set this within your Python script,\n but it's most reliable to set it before the script starts.\n\n**5. Use `torch.multiprocessing\n`**\n\nAlways use `import torch.multiprocessing as mp` instead of the standard `import multiprocessing as mp\n` when working with PyTorch. The `torch.multiprocessing` module is a wrapper that provides a few necessary modifications\n to work better with PyTorch tensors and shared memory.\n\nBy following these practices, particularly using the `spawn` start method and loading\n your model within the worker process, you can avoid the deadlocks that plague multiprocessing in PyTorch. As of 2026\n, these remain the most robust and recommended solutions.","hint":"A correct answer should explain that PyTorch multiprocessing deadlocks when loading models are typically caused by using the default `fork` start method with background threads / CUDA, and must mention switching to a safe start method like `'spawn'` or `'forkserver'` and/or following PyTorch’s multiprocessing best practices (e.g., guarding code with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`, avoiding problematic queues/threads, or using `DistributedDataParallel` instead of manual multiprocessing) as the primary fix.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","timestamp":30104},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":30104},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1770362953855-abc79596b6e7d8","status":"completed","timestamp":30104},{"type":"message","content":"PyTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock","timestamp":30104},{"type":"message","content":" when using multiprocessing due to how operating systems handle process creation and resource sharing, especially with libraries like PyTorch that manage their own thread","timestamp":30104},{"type":"message","content":" pools and CUDA contexts.
