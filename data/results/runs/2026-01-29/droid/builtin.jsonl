{"id":"websearch-49","input":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","output":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026\nBased on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to deploy a GPT model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026.\n\n## How to Deploy a GPT Model to Azure AI Foundry Using Pulumi (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nIn Azure AI Foundry, GPT model deployments are managed through **Azure Cognitive Services** (specifically `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` and deployments). There are two Pulumi packages you can use:\n\n1. **Azure Native** (recommended) - `@pulumi/azure-native` (v3.13.0+)\n2. **Azure Classic** - `@pulumi/azure` (v6.31.0)\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Install Pulumi CLI\ncurl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh\n\n# Login to Pulumi\npulumi login\n\n# Install Node.js SDK (or Python/Go/C#)\nnpm install @pulumi/azure-native\n# or for Python: pip install pulumi-azure-native\n```\n\n#### 2. Create a Pulumi Project\n\n```bash\npulumi new azure-typescript  # or azure-python, azure-go, etc.\n```\n\n#### 3. Code Example (TypeScript with Azure Native)\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// Create a Resource Group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"ai-foundry-rg\", {\n    location: \"eastus\",\n});\n\n// Create a Cognitive Services Account (Azure OpenAI / AI Services)\nconst cognitiveAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    accountName: \"my-openai-account\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",  // For Azure OpenAI Service\n    // Or use \"AIServices\" for Azure AI Foundry multi-service account\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\",\n    },\n    properties: {},\n});\n\n// Deploy a GPT Model\nconst gptDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    accountName: cognitiveAccount.name,\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-4-deployment\",\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-4\",        // Model name: gpt-4, gpt-4o, gpt-35-turbo, etc.\n            version: \"turbo-2024-04-09\",  // Check Azure for latest versions\n        },\n        versionUpgradeOption: \"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    },\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10,  // TPM (Tokens-per-Minute) in thousands\n    },\n});\n\n// Export the endpoint\nexport const endpoint = cognitiveAccount.properties.apply(p => p?.endpoint);\nexport const deploymentName = gptDeployment.name;\n```\n\n#### 4. Code Example (Python with Azure Native)\n\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport pulumi_azure_native as azure_native\n\n# Create a Resource Group\nresource_group = azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"ai-foundry-rg\",\n    location=\"eastus\"\n)\n\n# Create a Cognitive Services Account\ncognitive_account = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\",\n    account_name=\"my-openai-account\",\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    location=resource_group.location,\n    kind=\"OpenAI\",\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"S0\"\n    ),\n    properties={}\n)\n\n# Deploy a GPT Model\ngpt_deployment = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\",\n    account_name=cognitive_account.name,\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    deployment_name=\"gpt-4-deployment\",\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentPropertiesArgs(\n        model=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentModelArgs(\n            format=\"OpenAI\",\n            name=\"gpt-4\",\n            version=\"turbo-2024-04-09\"\n        ),\n        version_upgrade_option=\"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\"\n    ),\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"Standard\",\n        capacity=10\n    )\n)\n\n# Export outputs\npulumi.export(\"endpoint\", cognitive_account.properties.endpoint)\npulumi.export(\"deployment_name\", gpt_deployment.name)\n```\n\n#### 5.

There are two Pulumi packages you can use:\n\n1. **Azure Native** (recommended) - `@pulumi/azure-native` (v3.13.0+)\n2. **Azure Classic** - `@pulumi/azure` (v6.31.0)\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Install Pulumi CLI\ncurl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh\n\n# Login to Pulumi\npulumi login\n\n# Install Node.js SDK (or Python/Go/C#)\nnpm install @pulumi/azure-native\n# or for Python: pip install pulumi-azure-native\n```\n\n#### 2. Create a Pulumi Project\n\n```bash\npulumi new azure-typescript  # or azure-python, azure-go, etc.\n```\n\n#### 3. Code Example (TypeScript with Azure Native)\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// Create a Resource Group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"ai-foundry-rg\", {\n    location: \"eastus\",\n});\n\n// Create a Cognitive Services Account (Azure OpenAI / AI Services)\nconst cognitiveAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    accountName: \"my-openai-account\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",  // For Azure OpenAI Service\n    // Or use \"AIServices\" for Azure AI Foundry multi-service account\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\",\n    },\n    properties: {},\n});\n\n// Deploy a GPT Model\nconst gptDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    accountName: cognitiveAccount.name,\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-4-deployment\",\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-4\",        // Model name: gpt-4, gpt-4o, gpt-35-turbo, etc.\n            version: \"turbo-2024-04-09\",  // Check Azure for latest versions\n        },\n        versionUpgradeOption: \"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    },\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10,  // TPM (Tokens-per-Minute) in thousands\n    },\n});\n\n// Export the endpoint\nexport const endpoint = cognitiveAccount.properties.apply(p => p?.endpoint);\nexport const deploymentName = gptDeployment.name;\n```\n\n#### 4. Code Example (Python with Azure Native)\n\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport pulumi_azure_native as azure_native\n\n# Create a Resource Group\nresource_group = azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"ai-foundry-rg\",\n    location=\"eastus\"\n)\n\n# Create a Cognitive Services Account\ncognitive_account = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\",\n    account_name=\"my-openai-account\",\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    location=resource_group.location,\n    kind=\"OpenAI\",\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"S0\"\n    ),\n    properties={}\n)\n\n# Deploy a GPT Model\ngpt_deployment = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\",\n    account_name=cognitive_account.name,\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    deployment_name=\"gpt-4-deployment\",\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentPropertiesArgs(\n        model=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentModelArgs(\n            format=\"OpenAI\",\n            name=\"gpt-4\",\n            version=\"turbo-2024-04-09\"\n        ),\n        version_upgrade_option=\"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\"\n    ),\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"Standard\",\n        capacity=10\n    )\n)\n\n# Export outputs\npulumi.export(\"endpoint\", cognitive_account.properties.endpoint)\npulumi.export(\"deployment_name\", gpt_deployment.name)\n```\n\n#### 5.

{"id":"websearch-88","input":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","output":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?\nI'll search for the latest information on memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026.\nLet me fetch more specific content from some of these articles to provide you with detailed, current information.\nBased on my research of the latest LangGraph documentation and resources from 2025-2026, here's a comprehensive guide on **Memory State Management and RAG Context Injection in LangGraph for 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Memory State Management in LangGraph\n\nLangGraph provides two primary types of memory:\n\n### 1. Short-Term Memory (Thread-Level Persistence)\nShort-term memory enables multi-turn conversations within a single thread using **checkpointers**.\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START\n\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\nbuilder = StateGraph(MessagesState)\n# ... add nodes and edges ...\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Invoke with thread_id\ngraph.invoke(\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi! I'm Bob\"}]},\n    {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}},\n)\n```\n\n**Production checkpointers for 2026:**\n- `PostgresSaver` / `AsyncPostgresSaver` - Recommended for production\n- `RedisSaver` / `AsyncRedisSaver` - For high-performance caching\n- `MongoDBSaver` / `AsyncMongoDBSaver` - For document-oriented storage\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\n\nDB_URI = \"postgresql://user:pass@host/db\"\nwith PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI) as checkpointer:\n    checkpointer.setup()  # Run once for migrations\n    graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n```\n\n### 2. Long-Term Memory (Cross-Thread Persistence via Store)\nLong-term memory stores user-specific or application-level data across conversations using the **Store** interface.\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore\nfrom langgraph.store.base import BaseStore\n\nstore = InMemoryStore()\n\n# Access store in nodes\ndef call_model(state: MessagesState, config: RunnableConfig, *, store: BaseStore):\n    user_id = config[\"configurable\"][\"user_id\"]\n    namespace = (\"memories\", user_id)\n    \n    # Retrieve memories\n    memories = store.search(namespace, query=state[\"messages\"][-1].content)\n    \n    # Store new memories\n    store.put(namespace, str(uuid.uuid4()), {\"data\": \"User prefers concise answers\"})\n\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, store=store)\n```\n\n### 3. Semantic Search in Memory Store\nEnable semantic search with embeddings for finding relevant memories:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.embeddings import init_embeddings\nfrom langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore\n\nstore = InMemoryStore(\n    index={\n        \"embed\": init_embeddings(\"openai:text-embedding-3-small\"),\n        \"dims\": 1536,\n        \"fields\": [\"text\", \"$\"]  # Fields to embed\n    }\n)\n\n# Store and search semantically\nstore.put((\"user_123\", \"memories\"), \"1\", {\"text\": \"I love pizza\"})\nitems = store.search((\"user_123\", \"memories\"), query=\"What food do they like?\", limit=3)\n```\n\n---\n\n## RAG Context Injection in LangGraph\n\n### Basic RAG Pattern with Retriever Tool\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\n\n# Create retriever\nvectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()\n\n@tool\ndef retrieve_context(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Retrieve relevant documents based on the query.\"\"\"\n    docs = retriever.invoke(query)\n    return \"\\n\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])\n```\n\n### Agentic RAG with Document Grading\nA complete RAG system with document relevance grading:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass GradeDocuments(BaseModel):\n    binary_score: str = Field(description=\"'yes' if relevant, 'no' if not\")\n\ndef generate_query_or_respond(state: MessagesState):\n    \"\"\"Decide whether to retrieve or respond directly.\"\"\"\n    response = model.bind_tools([retriever_tool]).invoke(state[\"messages\"])\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\ndef grade_documents(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[\"generate_answer\", \"rewrite_question\"]:\n    \"\"\"Grade retrieved documents for relevance.\"\"\"\n    question = state[\"messages\"][0].content\n    context = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n    # Grade and route accordingly\n    score = grader_model.with_structured_output(GradeDocuments).invoke(...)\n    return \"generate_answer\" if score.binary_score == \"yes\" else \"rewrite_question\"\n\ndef generate_answer(state: MessagesState):\n    \"\"\"Generate final answer using retrieved context.\"\"\"\n    question = state[\"messages\"][0].content\n    context = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n    response = model.invoke(f\"Question: {question}\\nContext: {context}\")\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\n# Build the graph\nworkflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)\nworkflow.add_node(generate_query_or_respond)\nworkflow.add_node(\"retrieve\", ToolNode([retriever_tool]))\nworkflow.add_node(rewrite_question)\nworkflow.add_node(generate_answer)\n\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"generate_query_or_respond\")\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\"generate_query_or_respond\", tools_condition, {\"tools\": \"retrieve\", END: END})\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\"retrieve\", grade_documents)\nworkflow.add_edge(\"generate_answer\", END)\nworkflow.add_edge(\"rewrite_question\", \"generate_query_or_respond\")\n\ngraph = workflow.compile()\n```\n\n### Context Injection from Long-Term Memory + RAG\n\nCombine both memory and RAG for personalized context:\n\n```python\ndef call_model(state: MessagesState, config: RunnableConfig, *, store: BaseStore):\n    user_id = config[\"configurable\"][\"user_id\"]\n    \n    # Get user memories\n    memories = store.search((\"memories\", user_id), query=state[\"messages\"][-1].content, limit=3)\n    memory_context = \"\\n\".join([m.value[\"text\"] for m in memories])\n    \n    # Get RAG context\n    rag_docs = retriever.invoke(state[\"messages\"][-1].content)\n    rag_context = \"\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in rag_docs])\n    \n    # Inject both contexts\n    system_msg = f\"\"\"You are a helpful assistant.\n    \nUser memories: {memory_context}\n\nRelevant documents: {rag_context}\"\"\"\n    \n    response = model.invoke([{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_msg}] + state[\"messages\"])\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Use PostgresSaver for production** - Most reliable for state persistence\n2. **Enable semantic search** in stores for better memory retrieval\n3. **Implement document grading** in RAG to filter irrelevant context\n4. **Manage context window** with message trimming/summarization for long conversations\n5. **Namespace memories** by user_id for multi-tenant applications\n6. **Run database migrations** (`checkpointer.setup()`) as a deployment step","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","timestamp":85649},{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest information on memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026.","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012FBVjY3qFvonoueafP9Ufg","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015biVoet4PBvcMZphJpZKZ4","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch more specific content from some of these articles to provide you with detailed, current information.","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015rDkUHUzbSwBtTLMbyqRUn","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EwbPhTzX3BZC9JLND9i2KA","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01S2SPaYvdqiP17mkaf6j9UP","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VhFxmypNxJsM2XpRWWvy5F","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0171iX6fejaqAyHFc1YTm4hd","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013mgjPddAW986nymrYdgT8q","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MsJQHPXoj5aST6WYCGJdXp","status":"completed","timestamp":85649},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research of the latest LangGraph documentation and resources from 2025-2026, here's a comprehensive guide on **Memory State Management and RAG Context Injection in LangGraph for 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Memory State Management in LangGraph\n\nLangGraph provides two primary types of memory:\n\n### 1.

Here are the troubleshooting steps based on the official Factory.ai documentation:\n\n### 1. **Check Your Internet Connection**\nEnsure you have a stable internet connection, as the update requires downloading new versions from Factory's servers.\n\n### 2. **Verify Installation and Update the CLI**\nRun the following command to reinstall/update the CLI:\n\n**macOS/Linux:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://app.factory.ai/cli | sh\n```\n\n**Windows:**\nUse the official installer from https://app.factory.ai\n\n### 3. **Check Authentication**\nEnsure your API key is properly set:\n```bash\nexport FACTORY_API_KEY=fk-...\n```\nOr run `/login` in the CLI to re-authenticate.\n\n### 4. **Clear and Reset Configuration**\nIf the update keeps failing, try resetting your configuration:\n- Delete corrupted settings files (the CLI now uses **atomic writes** to prevent corruption as of v0.53.0)\n- Location: `~/.factory/` directory\n\n### 5. **Platform-Specific Fixes**\n\n**Windows Users:**\n- As of January 2026 (v0.48.0), Windows uses a **deferred update strategy** - updates are applied on next startup\n- If updates fail, restart the CLI completely\n\n**Linux Users:**\n- Ensure `xdg-utils` is installed: `sudo apt-get install xdg-utils`\n- Auto-update issues were fixed in v0.49.0\n\n### 6. **Check Logs for Specific Errors**\nView detailed error logs by checking:\n- The CLI output for specific error messages\n- Run `droid -v` to check your current version\n\n### 7. **Manual Update**\nIf auto-update fails consistently, perform a manual update by re-downloading and installing from the official source.\n\n### 8. **Contact Support**\nIf the issue persists:\n- Use `/bug [title]` command in the CLI to create a bug report with session data and logs\n- Join the Factory Discord community: https://discord.gg/zuudFXxg69\n- Check GitHub repository: https://github.com/Factory-AI/factory\n\n### Recent Fixes (January 2026 Changelog)\nAccording to the latest changelog, several update-related issues were fixed:\n- **v0.53.0**: Settings.json corruption prevention using atomic writes\n- **v0.55.1**: Authentication persistence and stability fixes\n- **v0.48.0**: Windows autoupdate now works correctly with deferred update strategy\n- **v0.49.0**: Linux autoupdate issues fixed","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to fix droid update failed error in factory.ai documentation 2026","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WxWHSXvyKHY2vfYmYdS8M9","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01U4yzAQ7LBD6YuFsEGQpwvT","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific documentation about the \"droid update failed\" error:","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FkYdqTxPaPyDyMFgw1WjW8","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AinJ91q2NQ3pTjrWhL1XgM","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific documentation about droid update errors and troubleshooting:","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XHRMEV9cUZbC84Zmazk2Bi","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GRhMVAreMh5LxG9Cr5TrgH","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HcZbiotcq116EvmYMJ9hFz","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GL8iCxK3NT1GvHUi7KPGhs","status":"completed","timestamp":61662},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research of the Factory.ai documentation for 2026, I can now provide you with comprehensive guidance on how to fix the \"droid update failed\" error.\n\n## How to Fix \"Droid Update Failed\" Error in Factory.ai (2026)\n\nThe \"droid update failed\" error can occur due to several reasons.

PostgreSQL Function Definition\n\nUse `DEFAULT NULL` or `DEFAULT '{}'` for the array parameter:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_pricing(\n    product_id UUID,\n    quantity INTEGER,\n    pricing_overrides JSONB[] DEFAULT NULL  -- or DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB[]\n)\nRETURNS TABLE (\n    final_price DECIMAL,\n    applied_overrides JSONB\n) AS $$\nBEGIN\n    IF pricing_overrides IS NULL OR array_length(pricing_overrides, 1) IS NULL THEN\n        -- Use default pricing logic\n        RETURN QUERY SELECT base_price, NULL::JSONB FROM products WHERE id = product_id;\n    ELSE\n        -- Apply pricing overrides\n        RETURN QUERY \n        SELECT calculated_price, jsonb_agg(override) \n        FROM unnest(pricing_overrides) AS override\n        -- ... override logic\n    END IF;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n## 2. Client-Side Best Practices (TypeScript/JavaScript)\n\n```typescript\n// Define clear types for your overrides\ninterface PricingOverride {\n  type: 'percentage' | 'fixed' | 'tiered';\n  value: number;\n  condition?: string;\n}\n\n// Call the RPC - omit the parameter entirely if not needed\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('calculate_pricing', {\n  product_id: 'abc-123',\n  quantity: 5,\n  // pricing_overrides is optional - don't pass it if unused\n});\n\n// Or pass the array when needed\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('calculate_pricing', {\n  product_id: 'abc-123',\n  quantity: 5,\n  pricing_overrides: [\n    { type: 'percentage', value: 10 },\n    { type: 'fixed', value: 5.00 }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n## 3. Key Best Practices Summary\n\n| Practice | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Default value** | Use `DEFAULT NULL` for optional arrays; check with `IS NULL` or `array_length()` |\n| **Type safety** | Use TypeScript interfaces for override structures |\n| **JSONB vs typed arrays** | Use `JSONB[]` for flexible override schemas; use typed arrays (`pricing_override[]`) for strict structures |\n| **Null handling** | Always check for `NULL` *and* empty arrays in your function logic |\n| **Named parameters** | Use named parameter syntax (`param_name =>`) when calling from SQL directly |\n| **Client omission** | Simply omit the parameter from the RPC call object rather than passing `null` or `undefined` |\n\n## 4. For Complex Pricing Override Structures\n\nConsider creating a custom PostgreSQL type:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TYPE pricing_override AS (\n    override_type TEXT,\n    value DECIMAL,\n    min_quantity INTEGER,\n    max_quantity INTEGER,\n    valid_until TIMESTAMPTZ\n);\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing(\n    base_price DECIMAL,\n    overrides pricing_override[] DEFAULT NULL\n) RETURNS DECIMAL AS $$\n-- ...\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n## 5.

{"id":"websearch-614","input":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","output":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024\nI'll help you understand how to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing in Google Search Console. Let me search for the most current information on this topic.\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive guide to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on your blog posts in Google Search Console:\n\n---\n\n## **Why Embedded YouTube Videos Aren't Indexing**\n\nGoogle updated its video indexing requirements in **late 2023**, making it significantly harder to get embedded videos indexed. The key change: **videos must be the PRIMARY content of a dedicated \"watch page\"** to be indexed—not supplementary content on a blog post.\n\n---\n\n## **Common Error Messages in Search Console**\n\n1. **\"Video is not the main content of the page\"** – Most common for blog posts\n2. **\"No thumbnail URL provided\"**\n3. **\"Video isn't on a watch page\"**\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix These Issues**\n\n### **1. Create Dedicated Video Pages (Most Effective)**\n\nInstead of embedding videos within blog posts, create standalone pages where the video is the hero content:\n\n- Place the video **at the very top** of the page\n- Make the page title include \"Video\" (e.g., \"How to Bake Bread - Video Tutorial\")\n- Include the video URL in the page slug (e.g., `/video/how-to-bake-bread`)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Implement VideoObject Structured Data (Schema Markup)**\n\nAdd JSON-LD markup to your page. Here's a template:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"A detailed description of your video content\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-15T08:00:00+00:00\",\n  \"duration\": \"PT5M30S\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"interactionStatistic\": {\n    \"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\",\n    \"interactionType\": { \"@type\": \"WatchAction\" },\n    \"userInteractionCount\": 12345\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n**Required properties:**\n- `name` – Video title\n- `description` – Detailed description\n- `thumbnailUrl` – Direct URL to thumbnail image\n- `uploadDate` – ISO 8601 format date\n\n---\n\n### **3. Add a Video Thumbnail**\n\nFor the \"No thumbnail URL provided\" error:\n\n- Use YouTube's auto-generated thumbnails: `https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg`\n- Ensure the thumbnail is at least **60x30 pixels** (recommended: 1280x720)\n- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP\n\n---\n\n### **4. Create and Submit a Video Sitemap**\n\nAdd a video sitemap to your `sitemap.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<url>\n  <loc>https://yoursite.com/video-page/</loc>\n  <video:video>\n    <video:thumbnail_loc>https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg</video:thumbnail_loc>\n    <video:title>Your Video Title</video:title>\n    <video:description>Video description here</video:description>\n    <video:content_loc>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID</video:content_loc>\n  </video:video>\n</url>\n```\n\nSubmit the sitemap in Google Search Console.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Include a Full Transcript**\n\nGoogle cannot fully analyze video content, so adding a **text transcript** below the video helps Google understand context and improves indexing chances.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Position Video Prominently**\n\n- Video should be **above the fold**\n- Minimize surrounding text/content that could make the video appear secondary\n- Don't hide video in tabs, accordions, or expandable sections\n\n---\n\n## **Important Reality Check**\n\n**For standard blog posts with embedded videos:** Google has explicitly stated that if video is supplementary content (which it typically is on blog posts), it **won't be indexed as a video result**. This is often the correct assessment—Google may still index your **page**, but the video won't appear in video search results.\n\n**Good news:** YouTube videos are already indexed on YouTube.com. Your blog post can still rank in regular search results; you just won't get the video rich snippet.\n\n---\n\n## **After Making Changes**\n\n1. **Validate in Search Console:** Go to the Video Indexing report → Click \"Validate Fix\"\n2. **Request Re-crawl:** Use URL Inspection tool → \"Request Indexing\"\n3. **Wait:** Validation typically takes 2-14 days\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Video not main content | Create dedicated video pages OR accept it won't get video rich results |\n| No thumbnail | Add `thumbnailUrl` in schema + ensure valid image URL |\n| Missing structured data | Add VideoObject JSON-LD markup |\n| Not discoverable | Submit video sitemap |\n\nFor most blog posts, the practical solution is to accept that embedded videos won't appear in video search results, but your **page content** can still rank well in regular search.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","timestamp":43612},{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you understand how to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing in Google Search Console.

Add the KSP plugin and dependencies:**\n\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts (root)\nplugins {\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\") version \"2.2.21-2.0.4\"\n}\n```\n\n**2. Version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`):**\n```toml\n[versions]\nlyricist = \"1.8.0\"\n\n[libraries]\nlyricist = { module = \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist\", version.ref = \"lyricist\" }\nlyricist-processor = { module = \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor\", version.ref = \"lyricist\" }\nlyricist-processorXml = { module = \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor-xml\", version.ref = \"lyricist\" }\n```\n\n**3. Multiplatform module setup:**\n```kotlin\n// shared/build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    // Code generation only at commonMain\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor:1.8.0\")\n}\n\n// Wire KSP task dependencies\ntasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinCompile<*>>().configureEach {\n    if (name != \"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\") {\n        dependsOn(\"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\")\n    }\n}\n\nkotlin.sourceSets.commonMain {\n    kotlin.srcDir(\"build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin\")\n}\n```\n\n**4. gradle.properties (KSP 2.0 optimizations):**\n```properties\nksp.useKsp2=true\nksp.incremental=true\nksp.incremental.log=false\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n**Define your strings with annotations:**\n```kotlin\n// Strings.kt\ndata class Strings(\n    val hello: String,\n    val greeting: (name: String) -> String,\n    val items: Plurals\n)\n\n@LyricistStrings(languageTag = Locales.EN, default = true)\nval EnStrings = Strings(\n    hello = \"Hello!\",\n    greeting = { name -> \"Hello $name!\" },\n    items = Plurals(one = \"1 item\", other = \"%d items\")\n)\n\n@LyricistStrings(languageTag = Locales.ES)\nval EsStrings = Strings(\n    hello = \"¡Hola!\",\n    greeting = { name -> \"¡Hola $name!\" },\n    items = Plurals(one = \"1 elemento\", other = \"%d elementos\")\n)\n```\n\n**Use in Compose:**\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun App() {\n    ProvideStrings {\n        val lyricist = LocalStrings.current\n        Text(lyricist.strings.hello)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Official Compose Multiplatform Resources**\n\nKotlin's official resources API (from JetBrains) now handles localization without requiring a separate KSP processor.\n\n#### Setup\n\n```kotlin\n// commonMain/composeResources/values/strings.xml (default)\n<resources>\n    <string name=\"app_name\">My App</string>\n    <string name=\"greeting\">Hello, %1$s!</string>\n</resources>\n\n// commonMain/composeResources/values-es/strings.xml (Spanish)\n<resources>\n    <string name=\"app_name\">Mi Aplicación</string>\n    <string name=\"greeting\">¡Hola, %1$s!</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### Usage\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun Greeting(name: String) {\n    Text(stringResource(Res.string.greeting, name))\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: Moko Resources**\n\n**Moko Resources** by IceRock is another mature library with Gradle-based code generation (not KSP, but generates type-safe accessors).\n\n#### Setup\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    id(\"dev.icerock.mobile.multiplatform-resources\") version \"0.24.3\"\n}\n\nmultiplatformResources {\n    resourcesPackage.set(\"com.example.app\")\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 4: Custom KSP Processor**\n\nFor custom requirements, you can build your own KSP processor.\n\n#### Basic KSP Processor Structure\n\n**1. Create processor module:**\n```kotlin\n// processor/build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"jvm\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"com.google.devtools.ksp:symbol-processing-api:2.2.21-2.0.4\")\n    implementation(\"com.squareup:kotlinpoet:1.18.1\")\n    implementation(\"com.squareup:kotlinpoet-ksp:1.18.1\")\n}\n```\n\n**2.

Add the KSP plugin and dependencies:**\n\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts (root)\nplugins {\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\") version \"2.2.21-2.0.4\"\n}\n```\n\n**2. Version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`):**\n```toml\n[versions]\nlyricist = \"1.8.0\"\n\n[libraries]\nlyricist = { module = \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist\", version.ref = \"lyricist\" }\nlyricist-processor = { module = \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor\", version.ref = \"lyricist\" }\nlyricist-processorXml = { module = \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor-xml\", version.ref = \"lyricist\" }\n```\n\n**3. Multiplatform module setup:**\n```kotlin\n// shared/build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    // Code generation only at commonMain\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor:1.8.0\")\n}\n\n// Wire KSP task dependencies\ntasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinCompile<*>>().configureEach {\n    if (name != \"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\") {\n        dependsOn(\"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\")\n    }\n}\n\nkotlin.sourceSets.commonMain {\n    kotlin.srcDir(\"build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin\")\n}\n```\n\n**4. gradle.properties (KSP 2.0 optimizations):**\n```properties\nksp.useKsp2=true\nksp.incremental=true\nksp.incremental.log=false\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n**Define your strings with annotations:**\n```kotlin\n// Strings.kt\ndata class Strings(\n    val hello: String,\n    val greeting: (name: String) -> String,\n    val items: Plurals\n)\n\n@LyricistStrings(languageTag = Locales.EN, default = true)\nval EnStrings = Strings(\n    hello = \"Hello!\",\n    greeting = { name -> \"Hello $name!\" },\n    items = Plurals(one = \"1 item\", other = \"%d items\")\n)\n\n@LyricistStrings(languageTag = Locales.ES)\nval EsStrings = Strings(\n    hello = \"¡Hola!\",\n    greeting = { name -> \"¡Hola $name!\" },\n    items = Plurals(one = \"1 elemento\", other = \"%d elementos\")\n)\n```\n\n**Use in Compose:**\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun App() {\n    ProvideStrings {\n        val lyricist = LocalStrings.current\n        Text(lyricist.strings.hello)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Official Compose Multiplatform Resources**\n\nKotlin's official resources API (from JetBrains) now handles localization without requiring a separate KSP processor.\n\n#### Setup\n\n```kotlin\n// commonMain/composeResources/values/strings.xml (default)\n<resources>\n    <string name=\"app_name\">My App</string>\n    <string name=\"greeting\">Hello, %1$s!</string>\n</resources>\n\n// commonMain/composeResources/values-es/strings.xml (Spanish)\n<resources>\n    <string name=\"app_name\">Mi Aplicación</string>\n    <string name=\"greeting\">¡Hola, %1$s!</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n#### Usage\n```kotlin\n@Composable\nfun Greeting(name: String) {\n    Text(stringResource(Res.string.greeting, name))\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: Moko Resources**\n\n**Moko Resources** by IceRock is another mature library with Gradle-based code generation (not KSP, but generates type-safe accessors).\n\n#### Setup\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    id(\"dev.icerock.mobile.multiplatform-resources\") version \"0.24.3\"\n}\n\nmultiplatformResources {\n    resourcesPackage.set(\"com.example.app\")\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 4: Custom KSP Processor**\n\nFor custom requirements, you can build your own KSP processor.\n\n#### Basic KSP Processor Structure\n\n**1. Create processor module:**\n```kotlin\n// processor/build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"jvm\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"com.google.devtools.ksp:symbol-processing-api:2.2.21-2.0.4\")\n    implementation(\"com.squareup:kotlinpoet:1.18.1\")\n    implementation(\"com.squareup:kotlinpoet-ksp:1.18.1\")\n}\n```\n\n**2. Implement the processor:**\n```kotlin\nclass I18nProcessor(\n    private val codeGenerator: CodeGenerator,\n    private val logger: KSPLogger\n) : SymbolProcessor {\n    \n    override fun process(resolver: Resolver): List<KSAnnotated> {\n        val symbols = resolver.getSymbolsWithAnnotation(\"com.example.I18nStrings\")\n        \n        symbols.filterIsInstance<KSClassDeclaration>()\n            .forEach { generateCode(it) }\n        \n        return emptyList()\n    }\n    \n    private fun generateCode(classDecl: KSClassDeclaration) {\n        val file = FileSpec.builder(\"com.example.generated\", \"Strings\")\n            .addType(/* generate type-safe string accessors */)\n            .build()\n        \n        codeGenerator.createNewFile(\n            Dependencies(true, classDecl.containingFile!!),\n            \"com.example.generated\",\n            \"Strings\"\n        ).bufferedWriter().use { file.writeTo(it) }\n    }\n}\n\nclass I18nProcessorProvider : SymbolProcessorProvider {\n    override fun create(environment: SymbolProcessorEnvironment) =\n        I18nProcessor(environment.codeGenerator, environment.logger)\n}\n```\n\n**3.

Never return masks.\nLimit to 25 objects. For each detected abnormality:\n- Include anatomical location (e.g., \"right upper lobe\", \"left ventricle\")\n- Specify confidence descriptors when applicable\n- Label according to radiological conventions\n```\n\n### 3. **Use Precise, Task-Specific Prompts**\nInstead of generic prompts, be highly specific:\n- ❌ \"Find abnormalities in this image\"\n- ✅ \"Identify and draw bounding boxes around all pulmonary nodules >3mm in this chest CT slice. Label each with position (RUL/RML/RLL/LUL/LLL) and approximate size\"\n\n### 4. **Leverage Few-Shot Prompting with Medical Examples**\nInclude 2-3 annotated examples in your prompt to demonstrate:\n- Expected coordinate format\n- Labeling conventions for your specific use case\n- Edge cases (e.g., overlapping structures, partial visibility)\n\n### 5. **Apply the \"Prompt Triage\" Methodology**\nBased on recent research (DSPy framework), use automated prompt optimization:\n- Start with zero-shot prompts\n- Iteratively refine using structured optimization\n- Studies show 53-3400% improvement over baseline zero-shot prompts in medical imaging\n\n### 6. **Combine Bounding Boxes with Segmentation Workflows**\nUse a two-stage approach (especially effective with SAM integration):\n1.

Never return masks.\nLimit to 25 objects. For each detected abnormality:\n- Include anatomical location (e.g., \"right upper lobe\", \"left ventricle\")\n- Specify confidence descriptors when applicable\n- Label according to radiological conventions\n```\n\n### 3. **Use Precise, Task-Specific Prompts**\nInstead of generic prompts, be highly specific:\n- ❌ \"Find abnormalities in this image\"\n- ✅ \"Identify and draw bounding boxes around all pulmonary nodules >3mm in this chest CT slice. Label each with position (RUL/RML/RLL/LUL/LLL) and approximate size\"\n\n### 4. **Leverage Few-Shot Prompting with Medical Examples**\nInclude 2-3 annotated examples in your prompt to demonstrate:\n- Expected coordinate format\n- Labeling conventions for your specific use case\n- Edge cases (e.g., overlapping structures, partial visibility)\n\n### 5. **Apply the \"Prompt Triage\" Methodology**\nBased on recent research (DSPy framework), use automated prompt optimization:\n- Start with zero-shot prompts\n- Iteratively refine using structured optimization\n- Studies show 53-3400% improvement over baseline zero-shot prompts in medical imaging\n\n### 6. **Combine Bounding Boxes with Segmentation Workflows**\nUse a two-stage approach (especially effective with SAM integration):\n1. Generate bounding box prompts using Gemini\n2. Use boxes as prompts for precise segmentation masks\n3. This weakly-supervised approach achieves ~85% Dice scores with limited annotations\n\n### 7. **Specify Image Characteristics in Prompts**\nInclude modality-specific context:\n```\n\"This is a high-resolution chest X-ray (PA view). \nIdentify bounding boxes for: cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, \npulmonary infiltrates, nodules.

Let me provide you with a complete guide:\n\n---\n\n# Setting Up Apache Guacamole with Docker and PostgreSQL (2025)\n\nBased on the official Apache Guacamole v1.6.0 documentation, here's a complete guide:\n\n## Overview\n\nA typical Docker deployment requires **three containers**:\n1. **`guacamole/guacd`** - The guacd daemon (handles VNC, RDP, SSH, telnet protocols)\n2. **`guacamole/guacamole`** - The web application (Tomcat 9.x)\n3. **`postgres`** - PostgreSQL database for authentication and configuration\n\n---\n\n## Complete Docker Compose Setup\n\n### 1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.8'\n\nvolumes:\n  initdb:       # Shared volume for database initialization scripts\n  postgres_data: # Persistent PostgreSQL data\n\nnetworks:\n  guacamole-net:\n    driver: bridge\n\nservices:\n  # PostgreSQL Database\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres:16\n    container_name: guacamole-postgres\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES_USER: guacamole_user\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_secure_password  # CHANGE THIS!\n    volumes:\n      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n      - initdb:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro  # Auto-initialize schema\n    networks:\n      - guacamole-net\n\n  # Guacd - The Guacamole proxy daemon\n  guacd:\n    image: guacamole/guacd\n    container_name: guacamole-guacd\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    networks:\n      - guacamole-net\n\n  # Guacamole Web Application\n  guacamole:\n    image: guacamole/guacamole\n    container_name: guacamole-web\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    depends_on:\n      - guacd\n      - postgres\n    environment:\n      GUACD_HOSTNAME: guacd\n      POSTGRESQL_HOSTNAME: postgres\n      POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRESQL_USER: guacamole_user\n      POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD: your_secure_password  # CHANGE THIS!\n    volumes:\n      # Share schema scripts to the initdb volume for auto-initialization\n      - initdb:/opt/guacamole/extensions/guacamole-auth-jdbc/postgresql/schema:ro\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    networks:\n      - guacamole-net\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### Step 1: Create a project directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir guacamole-docker && cd guacamole-docker\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the `docker-compose.yml` file\n\nCopy the YAML content above and save it. **Change the passwords!**\n\n### Step 3: Initialize the Database\n\nThe PostgreSQL database needs to be initialized with Guacamole's schema. There are two approaches:\n\n#### Option A: Using the shared volume (automatic - recommended)\n\nThe `docker-compose.yml` above uses a shared `initdb` volume that maps the Guacamole schema scripts to PostgreSQL's initialization directory. On first run, PostgreSQL will automatically execute these scripts.\n\n**Note:** This only works on the *first* container start when the database is empty.\n\n#### Option B: Manual initialization\n\nIf the database already exists or Option A doesn't work:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Start just PostgreSQL first\ndocker compose up -d postgres\n\n# 2. Generate the initialization SQL from the Guacamole image\ndocker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgresql > initdb.sql\n\n# 3. Run the SQL against the database\ncat initdb.sql | docker exec -i guacamole-postgres psql -U guacamole_user -d guacamole_db -f -\n\n# 4.

Let me provide you with a complete guide on using LangGraph's human interrupt and resume functionality in Python.\n\n## LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume in Python (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nLangGraph provides a powerful `interrupt()` function for human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows. When an interrupt is triggered, LangGraph saves the graph state using persistence and waits indefinitely until you resume execution using a `Command` object.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n1. **A checkpointer** - to persist graph state (use `MemorySaver` for testing, durable checkpointer like `SqliteSaver` for production)\n2. **A thread ID** - in your config so the runtime knows which state to resume from\n3. **`interrupt()` calls** - where you want to pause (payload must be JSON-serializable)\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\n# Define your state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    data: str\n    approved: bool | None\n\n# Create a node that uses interrupt\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval -

Let me provide you with a complete guide on using LangGraph's human interrupt and resume functionality in Python.\n\n## LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume in Python (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nLangGraph provides a powerful `interrupt()` function for human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows. When an interrupt is triggered, LangGraph saves the graph state using persistence and waits indefinitely until you resume execution using a `Command` object.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n1. **A checkpointer** - to persist graph state (use `MemorySaver` for testing, durable checkpointer like `SqliteSaver` for production)\n2. **A thread ID** - in your config so the runtime knows which state to resume from\n3. **`interrupt()` calls** - where you want to pause (payload must be JSON-serializable)\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\n# Define your state\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    data: str\n    approved: bool | None\n\n# Create a node that uses interrupt\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval -

This can lead to:\n- Compilation errors with packages not recognizing declarations (e.g., from the `unsafe` package)\n- Segmentation faults (nil pointer dereference errors)\n\n### 2. **Workspace Compatibility Issues**\nUsing govulncheck within Go workspaces (multi-module setups) can trigger fatal errors, especially when the tool version doesn't fully support the workspace feature of your Go version.\n\n### 3. **Outdated govulncheck Version**\nRunning an older version of govulncheck against projects using newer Go features (like Go 1.22+ or 1.26) can cause crashes or false results.\n\n### 4. **Indirect Dependency Scanning Differences**\ngovulncheck only checks \"effective\" dependencies (actively used in code), while other tools scan the entire dependency graph. This can cause confusion when CI/CD pipelines flag vulnerabilities that govulncheck doesn't report.\n\n---\n\n## How to Resolve Them\n\n### 1. **Align Go Versions**\nEnsure the Go version in your PATH matches what you need:\n```bash\n# Run govulncheck with a specific Go version\ngo1.22 run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck ./...\n```\n\n### 2. **Update to Latest Versions**\nKeep both Go and govulncheck updated to the latest patched versions:\n```bash\ngo install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest\n```\nIn 2026, ensure you're using Go 1.25.6+ or 1.24.12+ to include critical security patches (CVE-2025-61728, CVE-2025-61726, CVE-2025-68121).\n\n### 3. **Verify Dependency Compatibility**\nUse `go mod graph` to identify hidden dependency issues and ensure all modules are compatible with your Go version.\n\n### 4. **For Workspaces**\nIf using Go workspaces, test govulncheck on individual modules first, or update to the latest govulncheck version that better supports workspaces.\n\n### 5. **CI/CD Configuration**\nIn GitHub Actions, use the official `govulncheck-action` with explicit Go version pinning:\n```yaml\n- uses: golang/govulncheck-action@v1\n  with:\n    go-version: '1.26'\n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","timestamp":26195},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":26195},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NeyPPSwBHxpfoST56Zd6mr","status":"completed","timestamp":26195},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here are the **common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026**:\n\n## Common Causes\n\n### 1. **Go Version Mismatch**\nThe most frequent cause is when the Go command version used to run govulncheck doesn't match the version used to build the tool.

{"id":"websearch-1049","input":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","output":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation\nBased on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive guide on setting up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen feature.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Web Push Notifications on Safari iOS 16.4+\n\nApple introduced Web Push support for Safari on iOS/iPadOS 16.4 (released March 2023), but **only for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** that have been added to the Home Screen. Here's how to set it up:\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **HTTPS required** - Your site must be served over a secure connection\n2. **PWA installed** - Users must add your web app to their Home Screen\n3. **User gesture required** - Permission prompts must be triggered by user interaction (e.g., button click)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file in your site's root directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"AppName\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: The `display` property must be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` for iOS web push to work.\n\nLink it in your HTML `<head>`:\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Generate VAPID Keys\n\nVAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys are required for web push. Generate them using OpenSSL:\n\n```bash\n# Generate private key\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out private_key.pem\n\n# Generate public key\nopenssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 65 | base64 | tr '/+' '_-' | tr -d '='\n```\n\nOr use a library like `web-push` (Node.js):\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Register a Service Worker\n\nCreate a `service-worker.js` (or `sw.js`) file:\n\n```javascript\n// service-worker.js\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  const data = event.data ? event.data.json() : {};\n  const title = data.title || 'Notification';\n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || '',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: data.badge || '/icons/badge-72x72.png',\n    data: data.url || '/'\n  };\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(title, options)\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow(event.notification.data)\n  );\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Implement Push Subscription in JavaScript\n\n```javascript\n// Check if push is supported and app is installed (standalone mode)\nfunction isPWAInstalled() {\n  return window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches ||\n         window.navigator.standalone === true;\n}\n\nasync function registerServiceWorker() {\n  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');\n    return registration;\n  }\n  throw new Error('Service Worker not supported');\n}\n\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  // IMPORTANT: Must be called from a user gesture (click event)\n  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n  \n  const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n    userVisibleOnly: true,\n    applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array('YOUR_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY')\n  });\n  \n  // Send subscription to your server\n  await fetch('/api/save-subscription', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify(subscription)\n  });\n  \n  return subscription;\n}\n\n// Helper function to convert VAPID key\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\n// Request notification permission (must be from user interaction!)\nasync function requestNotificationPermission() {\n  if (!isPWAInstalled()) {\n    alert('Please add this app to your Home Screen first to enable notifications');\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n  if (permission === 'granted') {\n    await subscribeToPush();\n    console.log('Push notifications enabled!');\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach to a button click\ndocument.getElementById('enable-notifications-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  requestNotificationPermission();\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Backend - Send Push Notifications\n\nExample using Node.js with the `web-push` library:\n\n```javascript\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  'YOUR_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY',\n  'YOUR_PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY'\n);\n\nasync function sendPushNotification(subscription, payload) {\n  try {\n    await webpush.sendNotification(subscription, JSON.stringify(payload));\n    console.log('Push notification sent successfully');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error sending push notification:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Example payload\nconst payload = {\n  title: 'Hello!',\n  body: 'You have a new message',\n  icon: '/icons/icon-192x192.png',\n  url: '/messages'\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Guide Users to Add to Home Screen\n\nCreate a banner or prompt to instruct users:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"install-banner\" style=\"display: none;\">\n  <p>To enable notifications, add this app to your Home Screen:</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Tap the <strong>Share</strong> button <img src=\"/share-icon.png\" alt=\"share\"></li>\n    <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>\"Add to Home Screen\"</strong></li>\n  </ol>\n  <button onclick=\"dismissBanner()\">Got it</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n// Show banner only on iOS Safari (not in standalone mode)\nconst isIOS = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent);\nconst isInStandaloneMode = window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches;\n\nif (isIOS && !isInStandaloneMode) {\n  document.getElementById('install-banner').style.display = 'block';\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes & Limitations\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|------------|---------|\n| **iOS Version** | 16.4 or later required |\n| **Installation** | Must be added to Home Screen via Share → \"Add to Home Screen\" |\n| **User Gesture** | Permission prompt MUST be triggered by user interaction (click/tap) |\n| **Display Mode** | Manifest must have `display: \"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` |\n| **HTTPS** | Required for service workers and push |\n| **EU Restriction** | As of iOS 17.4+, Home Screen web apps may have limitations in the EU due to DMA regulations |\n\n---\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n1. **Test in Standalone Mode**: Open DevTools in Safari on macOS, connect your iOS device, and debug the PWA\n2. **Check Permissions**: Users can manage notification permissions in **Settings → Notifications → [Your App]**\n3. **Verify Manifest**: Use Chrome DevTools Application tab or Safari's manifest validator\n\n---\n\nThis setup follows the standard Web Push API that Safari on iOS 16.4+ now supports for installed PWAs. The key difference from desktop browsers is that the app **must be installed to the Home Screen** before push notifications can work.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":45906},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":45906},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0171jTrbR4DJvAqmaPnAYkfR","status":"completed","timestamp":45906},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive guide on setting up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen feature.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Web Push Notifications on Safari iOS 16.4+\n\nApple introduced Web Push support for Safari on iOS/iPadOS 16.4 (released March 2023), but **only for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** that have been added to the Home Screen.

{"id":"websearch-1075","input":"How to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?","output":"How to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?\nI'll search for current information on how to use GitHub Desktop for beginners who aren't programmers.\n## GitHub Desktop for Absolute Beginners (2024) - A Complete Guide\n\nHere's a beginner-friendly guide to using GitHub Desktop, perfect for non-programmers:\n\n---\n\n### **What is GitHub Desktop?**\nGitHub Desktop is a free, user-friendly application that lets you manage your files and projects with version control—**without ever typing commands**. Think of it as a \"save history\" system that tracks all changes to your files and lets you collaborate with others.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Create a Free GitHub Account**\n1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)\n2. Click **\"Sign up\"**\n3. Enter your email, create a password, and choose a username\n4. Verify your email address\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Download & Install GitHub Desktop**\n1. Visit [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)\n2. Click **\"Download for Windows\"** or **\"Download for macOS\"**\n3. Run the installer and follow the prompts\n4. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Create Your First Repository (Project Folder)**\nA \"repository\" (or \"repo\") is just a folder that GitHub tracks.\n\n1. In GitHub Desktop, click **\"Create a New Repository on your Hard Drive\"**\n2. Give it a name (e.g., \"my-first-project\")\n3. Choose where to save it on your computer\n4. Click **\"Create Repository\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Make Changes & Save Them (Commits)**\n1. Add or edit files in your repository folder (using any app—Word, Notepad, etc.)\n2. Open GitHub Desktop—it will automatically detect your changes\n3. In the bottom-left, write a short description of what you changed (e.g., \"Added intro paragraph\")\n4.

endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?\nI'll research common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and modern debugging approaches for 2026.\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive overview of **common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them**:\n\n---\n\n## Common Causes of 500 Internal Server Errors\n\n### 1. **Code & Application Issues**\n- **Unhandled exceptions** – Runtime errors in business logic not properly caught\n- **Code bugs** – Null pointer references, type mismatches, improper input handling\n- **Recent deployments** – New code introducing breaking changes\n- **Third-party dependency failures** – Incompatible library versions or external service errors\n\n### 2. **Server & Infrastructure Problems**\n- **Resource exhaustion** – Out-of-memory (OOM) issues, CPU limits reached\n- **Timeout errors** – Backend services taking too long to respond\n- **Server misconfigurations** – Incorrect routing, invalid environment variables\n- **File permission issues** – Server can't access required files/directories\n\n### 3. **Database Issues**\n- **Connection pool exhaustion** – Too many concurrent connections\n- **Query failures** – Malformed queries, deadlocks, missing tables\n- **Database unavailability** – Server down or network issues\n\n### 4. **API-Specific Causes**\n- **Malformed requests** – Incorrectly formatted JSON, missing required parameters\n- **Invalid mapping templates** – Sending incorrect data transformations to backends\n- **Authorization/permissions failures** – Invalid tokens, IAM misconfigurations\n- **CORS misconfigurations** – Blocking legitimate cross-origin requests\n\n### 5. **Cloud/Serverless Issues** (AWS, GCP, Azure)\n- **Lambda/Function errors** – Cold start timeouts, insufficient permissions\n- **API Gateway misconfigurations** – Incorrect integration settings\n- **Service overload** – Rate limiting, throttling from cloud providers\n\n---\n\n## How to Debug 500 Errors in 2026\n\n### Step 1: **Check Logs First**\n- **Application logs** – Look for stack traces and error messages\n- **Cloud provider logs** – AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor\n- **Web server logs** – Nginx/Apache error logs\n- **Structured logging with correlation IDs** – Trace requests across microservices\n\n### Step 2: **Reproduce the Error**\n- Use tools like **Postman**, **cURL**, or **HTTPie** to replicate the exact request\n- Verify request headers, body, query parameters match expected format\n- Test in staging environment to isolate production-specific issues\n\n### Step 3: **Analyze Recent Changes**\n- Check recent deployments via CI/CD pipeline history\n- Review git commits for recent code changes\n- Consider rolling back if error correlates with a deployment\n\n### Step 4: **Validate Configurations**\n- Environment variables and secrets\n- Database connection strings\n- API Gateway/proxy settings\n- IAM roles and permissions (for cloud services)\n\n### Step 5: **Test Dependencies**\n- Check external API health (third-party services)\n- Verify database connectivity and performance\n- Test message queue/cache connections (Redis, RabbitMQ)\n\n### Step 6: **Use Modern Observability Tools**\n- **Distributed tracing** – OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin\n- **APM solutions** – Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace\n- **Error tracking** – Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag\n- **Real-time monitoring** – Prometheus + Grafana dashboards\n\n### Step 7: **Implement Defensive Measures**\n- Add **circuit breakers** for external dependencies\n- Implement **graceful degradation** and fallback responses\n- Use **rate limiting** to prevent overload\n- Return specific error codes (422, 503) instead of generic 500 when possible\n\n---\n\n## Quick Debugging Checklist\n\n| Check | Command/Action |\n|-------|----------------|\n| Server logs | `tail -f /var/log/app/error.log` |\n| Cloud logs | AWS: `aws logs tail /aws/lambda/my-function` |\n| Request format | Validate JSON with linters, check API docs |\n| Database | Test connection, check slow query logs |\n| Memory/CPU | Monitor via `htop`, cloud metrics |\n| Rollback | Deploy previous known-good version |\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices to Prevent 500 Errors\n\n1. **Implement comprehensive error handling** – Catch all exceptions and return appropriate status codes\n2. **Use input validation** – Validate request payloads before processing\n3. **Add health checks** – `/health` endpoints for monitoring\n4. **Set up alerting** – Get notified immediately when 500 rates spike\n5. **Practice chaos engineering** – Test failure scenarios proactively","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are common causes of 500 errors in

{"id":"websearch-1267","input":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","output":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial\nI'll search for the most up-to-date information on setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo for 2026.\nNow let me fetch the official documentation from shadcn/ui and Turborepo for the most accurate and up-to-date information:\nLet me also fetch the changelog for the monorepo feature and get more details:\nNow I have all the information needed. Here's a comprehensive tutorial on setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo for 2026:\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Guide)\n\n## Overview\n\nAs of late 2024, shadcn/ui has **native monorepo support** built into the CLI, making it much easier to use in Turborepo projects. The CLI now automatically handles component installation, dependencies, and import paths across workspaces.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1: Create a New Monorepo Project (Recommended for New Projects)\n\n### Step 1: Initialize the Project\n\nRun the shadcn CLI and select the monorepo option:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using yarn\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@canary init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select **\"Next.js (Monorepo)\"**.\n\nThis creates a complete monorepo with:\n- **Turborepo** as the build system\n- Two workspaces: `apps/web` and `packages/ui`\n- **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS v4** pre-configured\n- All necessary configuration files\n\n### Step 2: Project Structure\n\nAfter initialization, you'll have this structure:\n\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/                    # Next.js application\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for the app\n│       └── ...\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/                     # Shared UI components\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for UI package\n│       ├── src/\n│       │   ├── components/     # Shared components go here\n│       │   ├── hooks/          # Shared hooks\n│       │   └── lib/            # Shared utilities\n│       └── ...\n├── turbo.json\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n```\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Add shadcn/ui to an Existing Turborepo\n\n### Step 1: Create the UI Package\n\nCreate a `packages/ui` directory with a `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create `components.json` Files\n\n**packages/ui/components.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**apps/web/components.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Important:** Ensure `style`, `iconLibrary`, and `baseColor` match in both files!\n\n### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS\n\nFor **Tailwind CSS v4**, leave the `tailwind` config empty in `components.json` (as shown above).\n\nMake sure your app imports the UI package's styles or configure content paths appropriately.\n\n---\n\n## Adding Components\n\n### Run the Add Command from Your App Directory\n\nNavigate to your app directory and run:\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\n\n# Add a single component\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n\n# Add multiple components\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button card input label\n\n# Add a pre-built block (like a login form)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add login-01\n```\n\n**What happens:**\n- **UI components** (button, input, card) → installed to `packages/ui/src/components/`\n- **App-specific components** (like login-form from blocks) → installed to `apps/web/components/`\n- **Dependencies** → automatically installed to the correct package\n- **Import paths** → automatically configured\n\n---\n\n## Using Components in Your App\n\nImport components from the `@workspace/ui` package:\n\n```tsx\n// Import UI components\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\n\n// Import hooks\nimport { useMediaQuery } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-media-query\"\n\n// Import utilities\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n\nexport function MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>Hello World</CardTitle>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button variant=\"default\">Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **components.json** | Every workspace needs one |\n| **Matching config** | `style`, `iconLibrary`, `baseColor` must match across workspaces |\n| **Tailwind v4** | Leave `tailwind` config empty in `components.json` |\n| **Aliases** | Properly define paths in both workspace configs |\n| **CLI location** | Run `add` command from your **app directory** |\n\n---\n\n## Running Your Monorepo\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# Run development server (from root)\npnpm dev\n\n# Build all packages\npnpm build\n\n# Type check\npnpm typecheck\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tips & Best Practices\n\n1. **Use pnpm** - It's the recommended package manager for Turborepo monorepos\n2. **Keep UI package focused** - Only shared components go in `packages/ui`\n3. **App-specific components** - Keep them in `apps/[app-name]/components`\n4. **Consistent theming** - Define CSS variables in a shared location\n5. **Turborepo caching** - Take advantage of remote caching for faster builds\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo)\n- [Turborepo shadcn/ui Guide](https://turborepo.dev/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui)\n-

Here's a comprehensive tutorial on setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo for 2026:\n\n---\n\n# How to Set Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Guide)\n\n## Overview\n\nAs of late 2024, shadcn/ui has **native monorepo support** built into the CLI, making it much easier to use in Turborepo projects. The CLI now automatically handles component installation, dependencies, and import paths across workspaces.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1: Create a New Monorepo Project (Recommended for New Projects)\n\n### Step 1: Initialize the Project\n\nRun the shadcn CLI and select the monorepo option:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using yarn\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@canary init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select **\"Next.js (Monorepo)\"**.\n\nThis creates a complete monorepo with:\n- **Turborepo** as the build system\n- Two workspaces: `apps/web` and `packages/ui`\n- **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS v4** pre-configured\n- All necessary configuration files\n\n### Step 2: Project Structure\n\nAfter initialization, you'll have this structure:\n\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/                    # Next.js application\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for the app\n│       └── ...\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/                     # Shared UI components\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for UI package\n│       ├── src/\n│       │   ├── components/     # Shared components go here\n│       │   ├── hooks/          # Shared hooks\n│       │   └── lib/            # Shared utilities\n│       └── ...\n├── turbo.json\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n```\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Add shadcn/ui to an Existing Turborepo\n\n### Step 1: Create the UI Package\n\nCreate a `packages/ui` directory with a `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create `components.json` Files\n\n**packages/ui/components.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@workspace/ui/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**apps/web/components.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@workspace/ui/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@workspace/ui/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Important:** Ensure `style`, `iconLibrary`, and `baseColor` match in both files!\n\n### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS\n\nFor **Tailwind CSS v4**, leave the `tailwind` config empty in `components.json` (as shown above).\n\nMake sure your app imports the UI package's styles or configure content paths appropriately.\n\n---\n\n## Adding Components\n\n### Run the Add Command from Your App Directory\n\nNavigate to your app directory and run:\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\n\n# Add a single component\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n\n# Add multiple components\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button card input label\n\n# Add a pre-built block (like a login form)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add login-01\n```\n\n**What happens:**\n- **UI components** (button, input, card) → installed to `packages/ui/src/components/`\n- **App-specific components** (like login-form from blocks) → installed to `apps/web/components/`\n- **Dependencies** → automatically installed to the correct package\n- **Import paths** → automatically configured\n\n---\n\n## Using Components in Your App\n\nImport components from the `@workspace/ui` package:\n\n```tsx\n// Import UI components\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\n\n// Import hooks\nimport { useMediaQuery } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-media-query\"\n\n// Import utilities\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n\nexport function MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>Hello World</CardTitle>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button variant=\"default\">Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **components.json** | Every workspace needs one |\n| **Matching config** | `style`, `iconLibrary`, `baseColor` must match across workspaces |\n| **Tailwind v4** | Leave `tailwind` config empty in `components.json` |\n| **Aliases** | Properly define paths in both workspace configs |\n| **CLI location** | Run `add` command from your **app directory** |\n\n---\n\n## Running Your Monorepo\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# Run development server (from root)\npnpm dev\n\n# Build all packages\npnpm build\n\n# Type check\npnpm typecheck\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tips & Best Practices\n\n1. **Use pnpm** - It's the recommended package manager for Turborepo monorepos\n2. **Keep UI package focused** - Only shared components go in `packages/ui`\n3. **App-specific components** - Keep them in `apps/[app-name]/components`\n4. **Consistent theming** - Define CSS variables in a shared location\n5. **Turborepo caching** - Take advantage of remote caching for faster builds\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo)\n- [Turborepo shadcn/ui Guide](https://turborepo.dev/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui)\n-

{"id":"websearch-1408","input":"How can I use SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models in 2025?","output":"How can I use SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models in 2025?\nI'll search for current information on SAE (Sparse Autoencoder) feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models.\nNow let me search for more practical tutorials and code implementations:\nBased on my comprehensive research, here's a detailed guide on using SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models:\n\n---\n\n## SAE Feature Steering for Mechanistic Interpretability in Multilingual Models (2025)\n\n### Overview\n\nSparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have become a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability, enabling researchers to extract interpretable features from LLM activations and use them to steer model behavior.

It launched in 2021 and allows users to send live photos directly to friends' home screens via an iOS widget, emphasizing intimacy over traditional social media features like likes and comments.\n\n**Key Marketing Strategy Elements in 2026:**\n\n1. **Gen Alpha Focus:** Locket's 2026 strategy centers heavily on targeting Gen Alpha users. About 80% of their engaged users are from this demographic, and CEO Matt Moss has positioned the app as Gen Alpha's *primary* social platform—not just a supplementary app.\n\n2. **Rollcall Feature Launch:** A major 2026 marketing push involves the \"Rollcall\" feature, which uses Apple's Live Activities technology to display content directly on iPhone Lock Screens. This feature allows users to share weekly \"photo dumps\" with close friends that disappear after seven days. In its first week, Rollcall generated over **1 million shares**.\n\n3. **TikTok Influencer Evolution:** Locket's TikTok strategy evolved from initially leveraging small influencers to building an internal growth team that consistently posts content. They also recruit dedicated TikTok creators to maintain their successful content format (short videos with face shots, engaging text overlays, and screen recordings).\n\n4. **Platform Feature Leverage:** A core philosophy of their strategy is capitalizing on Apple's native platform features—first home screen widgets, now Lock Screen Live Activities—to create intimate, real-time photo sharing experiences that feel integrated into the phone experience.\n\n5. **Privacy & Authenticity Positioning:** The app limits users to 20 close friends and removes algorithms and public feeds, marketing itself as an antidote to the pressures of traditional social media.\n\n**The Results:** As of 2025-2026, Locket has achieved 80+ million downloads, ranks in the top 20 free social networking apps, and has raised $12.5 million in seed funding with just 7 employees.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What is the story behind the Locket widget marketing strategy in 2026?","timestamp":26168},{"type":"message","content":"I'll search the web for information about Locket widget's marketing strategy in 2026.","timestamp":26168},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":26168},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GN3AXRRNvzTKYWtKX6QyWZ","status":"completed","timestamp":26168},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search, here's the story behind Locket widget's marketing strategy in 2026:\n\n## Locket Widget Marketing Strategy in 2026\n\n**The Origin Story:**\nLocket was created by Matt Moss originally as a personal app for his girlfriend during a long-distance relationship.

Add delays between calls when paginating.\n\n3. **Data Freshness** - Funding rates settle every 8 hours (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC).\n\n4. **January 2024 Update** - HTX removed `estimated_rate`, `next_funding_time`, and `realized_rate` from some responses. The `funding_rate` and `funding_time` fields remain available.\n\n5. **Alternative for Bulk Data** - For large historical datasets, consider using data providers like [Tardis.dev](https://docs.tardis.dev/historical-data-details/huobi-dm-linear-swap) which archive HTX swap data.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How can I use the Huobi HTX /swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate or /linear-swap-api endpoint to get historical funding rates for 2026?","timestamp":52709},{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you understand how to use the Huobi HTX API to get historical funding rates.

Here's how:\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\nimport requests\nimport time\n\ndef get_historical_funding_rates(contract_code, start_timestamp, end_timestamp):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetch historical funding rates for a specific time range.\n    For USDT-margined: use 'BTC-USDT', 'ETH-USDT', etc.\n    For Coin-margined: use 'BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD', etc.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Choose endpoint based on contract type\n    if \"-USDT\" in contract_code.upper():\n        base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    else:\n        base_url = \"https://api.hbdm.com/swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate\"\n    \n    all_data = []\n    page_index = 1\n    page_size = 50  # Maximum allowed\n    \n    while True:\n        params = {\n            \"contract_code\": contract_code,\n            \"page_index\": page_index,\n            \"page_size\": page_size\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        result = response.json()\n        \n        if result[\"status\"] != \"ok\":\n            print(f\"Error: {result}\")\n            break\n        \n        data = result[\"data\"][\"data\"]\n        if not data:\n            break\n        \n        # Filter for 2026 data\n        for record in data:\n            funding_time = int(record[\"funding_time\"])\n            if start_timestamp <= funding_time <= end_timestamp:\n                all_data.append(record)\n            elif funding_time < start_timestamp:\n                # Data is chronologically ordered (newest first)\n                # So if we're past the start, we can stop\n                return all_data\n        \n        # Check if we've reached the last page\n        if page_index >= result[\"data\"][\"total_page\"]:\n            break\n        \n        page_index += 1\n        time.sleep(0.1)  # Rate limiting\n    \n    return all_data\n\n# Usage for 2026 data:\n# 2026-01-01 00:00:00 UTC = 1767225600000 ms\n# 2026-12-31 23:59:59 UTC = 1798761599000 ms\nstart_2026 = 1767225600000\nend_2026 = 1798761599000\n\n# For USDT-margined BTC perpetual\nbtc_usdt_funding = get_historical_funding_rates(\"BTC-USDT\", start_2026, end_2026)\n\n# For Coin-margined BTC perpetual\nbtc_usd_funding = get_historical_funding_rates(\"BTC-USD\", start_2026, end_2026)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key Notes:**\n\n1. **No Authentication Required** - These are public endpoints, no API key needed.\n\n2. **Rate Limits** - HTX typically allows ~10 requests/second for public endpoints. Add delays between calls when paginating.\n\n3. **Data Freshness** - Funding rates settle every 8 hours (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC).\n\n4. **January 2024 Update** - HTX removed `estimated_rate`, `next_funding_time`, and `realized_rate` from some responses. The `funding_rate` and `funding_time` fields remain available.\n\n5. **Alternative for Bulk Data** - For large historical datasets, consider using data providers like [Tardis.dev](https://docs.tardis.dev/historical-data-details/huobi-dm-linear-swap) which archive HTX swap data.","timestamp":52709}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Cryptocurrency Exchange","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769686105715,"end":1769686158424,"firstResponse":52709,"sessionCreation":0,"total":52709},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Here's how it works:\n\n### Core Concept\n\nThe technique exploits legitimate DLLs loaded into a process's memory space as \"decoys\" to hide malicious shellcode. Instead of allocating suspicious new memory regions with RWX permissions, attackers overwrite portions of a legitimate DLL that's already loaded, making the malicious code appear to originate from trusted Windows components.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n#### 1. **Target Process Selection**\n- Create a new process (e.g., `notepad.exe`) in a suspended state, OR\n- Open a handle to an existing process\n\n#### 2. **DLL Loading with LoadLibraryEx**\nThe key innovation is using `LoadLibraryEx` with the **`DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` (0x00000001)** flag instead of regular `LoadLibrary`:\n\n```c\nLoadLibraryEx(\"amsi.dll\", NULL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES);\n```\n\n**Why this flag matters:**\n- Loads the DLL into memory **without calling DllMain**\n- Doesn't process the import table\n- Prevents shellcode from executing multiple times when threads are created/destroyed\n- Avoids triggering `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` / `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH` callbacks\n\n#### 3. **Locate Injection Point**\nParse the loaded DLL's PE headers to find a suitable injection location:\n- **Entry Point** (most common): The DLL's `AddressOfEntryPoint` from the PE Optional Header\n- **Exported Functions**: Like `DllCanUnloadNow` for a less obvious injection point\n\n```c\nPIMAGE_DOS_HEADER mzHeader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)hTargetDLL;\nPIMAGE_NT_HEADERS peHeader = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((char*)hTargetDLL + mzHeader->e_lfanew);\nvoid* entryPointDLL = (void*)((char*)hTargetDLL + peHeader->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);\n```\n\n#### 4. **Memory Permission Modification**\nChange the target memory region to writable:\n```c\nVirtualProtect(entryPointDLL, shellcode_size, PAGE_READWRITE, &oldProtect);\n```\n\n#### 5. **Shellcode Injection**\nOverwrite the DLL's entry point or exported function with shellcode:\n```c\nmemcpy(entryPointDLL, shellcode, shellcode_size);\n```\n\n#### 6. **Restore Permissions**\n```c\nVirtualProtect(entryPointDLL, shellcode_size, oldProtect, &oldProtect);\n```\n\n#### 7. **Execute Shellcode**\nCreate a thread pointing to the modified entry point:\n```c\nCreateThread(0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)entryPointDLL, NULL, 0, 0);\n// Or for remote processes:\nCreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, entryPointDLL, NULL, 0, NULL);\n```\n\n### Advanced Variant: Remote Process Injection\n\nFor injecting into another process:\n\n1. **PPID Spoofing** -

Supports nested JSON, images (JPG, PNG, WEBP, SVG, GIF), and random population. |\n| **[JSON to Figma Import](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1396123287818850149/json-to-figma-import)** | Creating nodes directly from JSON structure definitions. |\n| **[Populate](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1508085034287600469)** | Using JSON, CSV, and AI-generated data to populate designs. |\n| **[Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/)** | Managing design tokens via JSON for variables and styles. |\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Build a Custom Plugin**\n\nUse the **Figma Plugin API** to programmatically create nodes from your own JSON structure.\n\n#### Key API Methods for Creating Nodes:\n\n```javascript\n// Create different node types\nconst frame = figma.createFrame();\nconst text = figma.createText();\nconst rect = figma.createRectangle();\nconst ellipse = figma.createEllipse();\nconst component = figma.createComponent();\n```\n\n#### Example: Creating Nodes from JSON\n\n```javascript\n// Sample JSON structure\nconst designJSON = {\n  \"type\": \"FRAME\",\n  \"name\": \"Card\",\n  \"width\": 300,\n  \"height\": 200,\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"TEXT\",\n      \"name\": \"Title\",\n      \"characters\": \"Hello World\",\n      \"x\": 20,\n      \"y\": 20,\n      \"fontSize\": 24\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"RECTANGLE\",\n      \"name\": \"Background\",\n      \"x\": 0,\n      \"y\": 0,\n      \"width\": 300,\n      \"height\": 200,\n      \"fills\": [{ \"type\": \"SOLID\", \"color\": { \"r\": 0.9, \"g\": 0.9, \"b\": 0.9 } }]\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\n// Recursive function to create nodes from JSON\nasync function createNodeFromJSON(json, parent) {\n  let node;\n  \n  switch (json.type) {\n    case 'FRAME':\n      node = figma.createFrame();\n      node.resize(json.width || 100, json.height || 100);\n      break;\n    case 'TEXT':\n      node = figma.createText();\n      await figma.loadFontAsync({ family: \"Inter\", style: \"Regular\" });\n      node.characters = json.characters || \"\";\n      if (json.fontSize) node.fontSize = json.fontSize;\n      break;\n    case 'RECTANGLE':\n      node = figma.createRectangle();\n      node.resize(json.width || 100, json.height || 100);\n      break;\n    // Add more node types as needed\n  }\n  \n  // Set common properties\n  if (node) {\n    node.name = json.name || node.type;\n    if (json.x !== undefined) node.x = json.x;\n    if (json.y !== undefined) node.y = json.y;\n    if (json.fills) node.fills = json.fills;\n    \n    // Append to parent\n    if (parent) {\n      parent.appendChild(node);\n    }\n    \n    // Recursively create children\n    if (json.children && 'appendChild' in node) {\n      for (const child of json.children) {\n        await createNodeFromJSON(child, node);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return node;\n}\n\n// Usage\ncreateNodeFromJSON(designJSON, figma.currentPage);\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Getting Started with Plugin Development**\n\n1. **Install prerequisites**: Node.js, Figma Desktop App, VS Code\n2. **Create a new plugin**: In Figma → Plugins → Development → New Plugin\n3. **Edit `manifest.json`**:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"JSON Importer\",\n     \"id\": \"your-plugin-id\",\n     \"api\": \"1.0.0\",\n     \"main\": \"code.js\",\n     \"ui\": \"ui.html\",\n     \"editorType\": [\"figma\"]\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Build your plugin** using the API methods above\n5. **Test** by running from Plugins → Development → Your Plugin\n\n---\n\n### **Resources**\n\n- [Figma Plugin Quickstart Guide](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/plugin-quickstart-guide/)\n- [Figma Plugin API Reference](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/api-reference/)\n- [Node Types Documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/nodes/)\n\nFor most use cases in 2026, the **JSON to Figma** plugin or **Tokens Studio** should handle standard JSON imports. For custom JSON structures or advanced automation, building a custom plugin gives you full control over node creation.","timestamp":59387}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"Figma_Plugin","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769686545897,"end":1769686605284,"firstResponse":59387,"sessionCreation":0,"total":59387},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Here's the answer:\n\n## Using rust-libp2p Relay Client Behaviour to Dial Through a Relay\n\nIn **libp2p v0.56.0** (current latest), here's how to use the relay client to dial through a relay:\n\n### 1. Setup Dependencies in Cargo.toml\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.56\", features = [\"relay\", \"tcp\", \"noise\", \"yamux\", \"identify\"] }\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\nfutures = \"0.3\"\n```\n\n### 2. Create the Relay Client\n\nThe key function is `relay::client::new()` which returns both a `Transport` and a `Behaviour`:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay, \n    core::transport::OrTransport,\n    PeerId, Multiaddr,\n    multiaddr::Protocol,\n    core::transport::DialOpts,\n    core::{Endpoint, transport::PortUse},\n};\n\n// Create the relay client transport and behaviour\nlet local_peer_id = PeerId::random();\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n\n// Combine with your actual transport (e.g., TCP)\nlet transport = OrTransport::new(relay_transport, tcp_transport);\n```\n\n### 3. Dialing Through a Relay\n\nTo dial a peer through a relay, construct a multiaddress with the `/p2p-circuit` protocol:\n\n```rust\n// Construct the relay address\nlet relay_id: PeerId = /* your relay's peer id */;\nlet destination_id: PeerId = /* destination peer's id */;\n\nlet dst_addr_via_relay = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Ip4([1, 2, 3, 4].into()))  // Relay's IP\n    .with(Protocol::Tcp(4001))                  // Relay's port\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_id))              // Relay peer id\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)                 // Signal to use relay\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_id));       // Destination peer id\n\n// Dial through the relay\ntransport.dial(dst_addr_via_relay, DialOpts {\n    port_use: PortUse::Reuse,\n    role: Endpoint::Dialer,\n}).unwrap();\n```\n\n### 4. Listening for Incoming Relayed Connections\n\n```rust\nlet relay_addr = Multiaddr::empty()\n    .with(Protocol::Ip4([1, 2, 3, 4].into()))\n    .with(Protocol::Tcp(4001))\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_id))\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit);  // Signal to listen via relay\n\ntransport.listen_on(ListenerId::next(), relay_addr).unwrap();\n```\n\n### 5. Complete Example with Swarm\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay, identify, dcutr, ping,\n    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, SwarmEvent},\n    tcp, noise, yamux,\n    Swarm, SwarmBuilder,\n    PeerId, Multiaddr,\n    multiaddr::Protocol,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct Behaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    identify: identify::Behaviour,\n    dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour,  // For hole punching\n    ping: ping::Behaviour,\n}\n\nasync fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let local_key = libp2p::identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();\n    let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());\n\n    let (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n\n    let mut swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_existing_identity(local_key)\n        .with_tokio()\n        .with_tcp(tcp::Config::default(), noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)?\n        .with_other_transport(|_keypair| relay_transport)?\n        .with_behaviour(|keypair| {\n            Behaviour {\n                relay_client: relay_behaviour,\n                identify: identify::Behaviour::new(identify::Config::new(\n                    \"/your-protocol/1.0.0\".into(),\n                    keypair.public(),\n                )),\n                dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour::new(local_peer_id),\n                ping: ping::Behaviour::new(ping::Config::new()),\n            }\n        })?\n        .build();\n\n    // Listen on relay\n    let relay_addr: Multiaddr = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID/p2p-circuit\"\n        .parse()\n        .unwrap();\n    swarm.listen_on(relay_addr)?;\n\n    // Dial through relay\n    let remote_addr: Multiaddr = \n        \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID/p2p-circuit/p2p/DEST_PEER_ID\"\n        .parse()\n        .unwrap();\n    swarm.dial(remote_addr)?;\n\n    // Event loop\n    loop {\n        match swarm.select_next_some().await {\n            SwarmEvent::Behaviour(event) => {\n                println!(\"Behaviour event: {:?}\", event);\n            }\n            SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished { peer_id, .. } => {\n                println!(\"Connected to {peer_id}\");\n            }\n            _ => {}\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **`relay::client::new(peer_id)`** - Creates both the `Transport` and `Behaviour` that work together\n2. **`OrTransport`** - Combines relay transport with your base transport (TCP/QUIC)\n3. **`/p2p-circuit`** protocol - Signals that the connection should go through the relay\n4. **DCUtR (optional)** - Add `dcutr::Behaviour` for hole punching to upgrade relayed connections to direct ones\n5. The relay client `Behaviour` must be included in your composed `NetworkBehaviour` for proper functioning","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012JxK6WXtfed8xcFTvKbj8m","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Js41B6SH7QY7qP1DNP2TEC","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017h9U5BfZS6MvsY5oPXQW7p","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NS9L4aC4WGoo4KvYoEjNns","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YJsDXumEkdDepX4HgG2JkL","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LC5ZFUChjki37dLy3Dk8hp","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for more specific code examples in the rust-libp2p repository:","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01K4pCaQmX954q9rUW3FcMEq","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013pEJ1JFCLyn525ReWNeTAa","status":"completed","timestamp":92597},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I now have comprehensive information about using the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through a relay.

Complete Example with Swarm\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay, identify, dcutr, ping,\n    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, SwarmEvent},\n    tcp, noise, yamux,\n    Swarm, SwarmBuilder,\n    PeerId, Multiaddr,\n    multiaddr::Protocol,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct Behaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    identify: identify::Behaviour,\n    dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour,  // For hole punching\n    ping: ping::Behaviour,\n}\n\nasync fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let local_key = libp2p::identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();\n    let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());\n\n    let (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n\n    let mut swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_existing_identity(local_key)\n        .with_tokio()\n        .with_tcp(tcp::Config::default(), noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)?\n        .with_other_transport(|_keypair| relay_transport)?\n        .with_behaviour(|keypair| {\n            Behaviour {\n                relay_client: relay_behaviour,\n                identify: identify::Behaviour::new(identify::Config::new(\n                    \"/your-protocol/1.0.0\".into(),\n                    keypair.public(),\n                )),\n                dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour::new(local_peer_id),\n                ping: ping::Behaviour::new(ping::Config::new()),\n            }\n        })?\n        .build();\n\n    // Listen on relay\n    let relay_addr: Multiaddr = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID/p2p-circuit\"\n        .parse()\n        .unwrap();\n    swarm.listen_on(relay_addr)?;\n\n    // Dial through relay\n    let remote_addr: Multiaddr = \n        \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID/p2p-circuit/p2p/DEST_PEER_ID\"\n        .parse()\n        .unwrap();\n    swarm.dial(remote_addr)?;\n\n    // Event loop\n    loop {\n        match swarm.select_next_some().await {\n            SwarmEvent::Behaviour(event) => {\n                println!(\"Behaviour event: {:?}\", event);\n            }\n            SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished { peer_id, .. } => {\n                println!(\"Connected to {peer_id}\");\n            }\n            _ => {}\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **`relay::client::new(peer_id)`** - Creates both the `Transport` and `Behaviour` that work together\n2. **`OrTransport`** - Combines relay transport with your base transport (TCP/QUIC)\n3. **`/p2p-circuit`** protocol - Signals that the connection should go through the relay\n4. **DCUtR (optional)** - Add `dcutr::Behaviour` for hole punching to upgrade relayed connections to direct ones\n5. The relay client `Behaviour` must be included in your composed `NetworkBehaviour` for proper functioning","timestamp":92597}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Libp2p_Rust","lang":"Rust","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769687130397,"end":1769687222994,"firstResponse":92597,"sessionCreation":0,"total":92597},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

{"id":"websearch-1828","input":"How to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?","output":"How to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?\nI'll help you find information about integrating YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026. Let me search for current documentation and guides on this topic.\nI found very useful information. Let me get more specific details on the New API and One API payment integration configurations.\nNow I have comprehensive information. Let me compile a complete guide on integrating YiPay (易支付/EPay) with one-api and new-api.\n\n## How to Integrate YiPay (易支付) with One-API and New-API in 2026\n\n### Overview\n\n**YiPay (易支付/EPay)** is a third-party aggregated payment gateway that consolidates multiple payment channels (WeChat Pay, Alipay, bank cards) into a unified interface. Both **one-api** (by songquanpeng) and **new-api** (by QuantumNous) support YiPay integration for user recharge/top-up functionality.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\nBefore integration, you need:\n1. **A YiPay merchant account** with:\n   - Merchant ID (PID/商户ID)\n   - Merchant Key (KEY/通信密钥)\n   - API Base URL from your YiPay provider\n\n2. **A running one-api or new-api instance**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Integration with New-API\n\nNew-API has built-in EPay support. Configure it in the admin panel:\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Log in to your New-API admin dashboard\n2. Navigate to **Settings → Payment Settings**\n3. Fill in the EPay configuration:\n   - **API Base URL**: Your YiPay provider's API endpoint (e.g., `https://pay.example.com`)\n   - **Merchant ID (PID)**: Your merchant ID from the YiPay provider\n   - **Merchant Key (KEY)**: Your secret key for signing requests\n\n4. Configure **Recharge Methods** using JSON:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\", \n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"QQ钱包\",\n    \"color\": \"#12B7F5\",\n    \"type\": \"qqpay\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n5. Optionally set **minimum top-up amounts** and **discounts**:\n```json\n{\n  \"100\": 0.95,\n  \"200\": 0.9,\n  \"500\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\n6. Save settings to enable the wallet recharge feature\n\n---\n\n### 3. Integration with One-API (songquanpeng)\n\nOne-API also supports EPay through environment variables or admin settings:\n\n**Option A: Environment Variables**\n```bash\n# Docker deployment example\ndocker run --name one-api -d --restart always \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e EPAY_API_URL=\"https://pay.example.com\" \\\n  -e EPAY_PID=\"your_merchant_id\" \\\n  -e EPAY_KEY=\"your_merchant_key\" \\\n  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \\\n  -v /home/ubuntu/data/one-api:/data \\\n  justsong/one-api\n```\n\n**Option B: Admin Panel Configuration**\n1. Log in as admin (default: `root` / `123456`)\n2. Go to **Settings → Payment Configuration**\n3. Enter your EPay credentials:\n   - Payment API URL\n   - Merchant ID\n   - Merchant Key\n\n---\n\n### 4. YiPay Callback Configuration\n\nFor payment notifications to work properly:\n\n1. **Set Notify URL (异步通知)**: Configure in your YiPay merchant backend\n   - Format: `https://your-domain.com/api/user/epay/notify`\n   - This URL receives POST requests when payment completes\n\n2. **Set Return URL (页面跳转)**: \n   - Format: `https://your-domain.com/topup`\n   - User is redirected here after payment\n\n3. **Whitelist IPs**: Some YiPay providers require whitelisting their callback IPs\n\n---\n\n### 5. Security Best Practices (2026 Requirements)\n\n1. **Use HTTPS** for all endpoints\n2. **Verify signatures** - Both one-api and new-api automatically verify EPay callback signatures\n3. **Keep keys secure** - Never expose your merchant key in client-side code\n4. **Regular key rotation** - Update API keys periodically\n5. **Monitor transactions** - Check payment logs for anomalies\n\n---\n\n### 6. Common Payment Types (Channel Codes)\n\n| Payment Method | Type Code |\n|---------------|-----------|\n| Alipay | `alipay` |\n| WeChat Pay | `wxpay` |\n| QQ Pay | `qqpay` |\n| UnionPay | `bank` |\n| Custom | `custom1`, `custom2`, etc. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Payment not credited | Check notify_url is accessible, verify signature settings |\n| \"Invalid sign\" error | Verify merchant key is correct, check encoding (UTF-8) |\n| Callback not received | Whitelist YiPay's IP addresses in your firewall |\n| 404 on callback | Ensure API routes are properly configured |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nIntegrating YiPay with one-api/new-api in 2026 is straightforward:\n1. Obtain YiPay merchant credentials (PID, KEY, API URL)\n2. Configure in the admin panel or environment variables\n3. Set up callback URLs in your YiPay merchant backend\n4. Configure payment methods (Alipay, WeChat, etc.)\n5. Test with small amounts before going live\n\nBoth platforms handle signature verification and order management automatically, making the integration process relatively simple for operators.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?","timestamp":83142},{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you find information about integrating YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026.

2025?\nBased on my web search, here are the **latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025**:\n\n## Core Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Data Quality & Validation**\n- Implement data quality checks **before** loading data (identify duplicates, null values, schema mismatches)\n- Validate and certify data to prevent errors that lead to poor business decisions\n- Organizations report achieving 99.9% data accuracy with proper practices\n\n### 2. **ETL vs. ELT Decision**\n- **ETL**: Transform before loading – best for structured data with predictable transformations\n- **ELT**: Load raw data first, transform in the target system – preferred in cloud environments where warehouses have strong processing power\n- Choose based on your data architecture, latency requirements, and warehouse capabilities\n\n### 3. **Real-Time & Streaming Capabilities**\n- Move beyond traditional batch processing to support real-time data needs\n- Implement **Change Data Capture (CDC)** for continuous, low-latency synchronization\n- Enable timely insights for analytics, ML, and compliance reporting\n\n### 4. **Automation & Orchestration**\n- Automate extraction, partitioning, and incremental loading to reduce manual errors\n- Use orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Dagster, dbt) for managing complex workflows and dependencies\n- Implement dynamic resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage) to avoid bottlenecks\n\n### 5. **Scalability & Performance**\n- Design pipelines to handle increasing data volumes without performance degradation\n- Use parallel processing and modular architectures\n- Optimize transformation logic to reduce latency and resource consumption\n\n### 6. **Metadata Management & Lineage**\n- Track data lineage for auditability and compliance\n- Maintain robust metadata to understand data origins, transformations, and dependencies\n\n### 7. **Security & Compliance**\n- Implement data masking to protect sensitive information throughout the pipeline\n- Ensure compliance with regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)\n- Prioritize encryption and access controls\n\n### 8. **Monitoring & Observability**\n- Establish continuous monitoring to track pipeline performance and data quality\n- Implement comprehensive logging and alerting for early issue detection\n- Conduct regular audits to identify improvement areas\n\n### 9. **Documentation & Version Control**\n- Maintain thorough documentation of ETL workflows for troubleshooting and onboarding\n- Use version control for pipeline code to ensure reliability and facilitate updates\n\n###

Let me provide a complete answer on managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in production for 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Managing Terraform Security Scanning Baseline Exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in Production (2026)\n\n### 1. **Checkov Baseline Management**\n\n#### Creating and Using Baselines\nCheckov provides a powerful baseline feature to manage exceptions at scale:\n\n```bash\n# Create a baseline file capturing current state\ncheckov -d /path/to/terraform --create-baseline\n\n# This generates .checkov.baseline in the directory\n\n# Run subsequent scans comparing against the baseline\ncheckov -d /path/to/terraform --baseline /path/to/.checkov.baseline\n```\n\nThe baseline file captures all current findings, so future scans only report *new* issues introduced after the baseline was established.\n\n#### Inline Skip Directives\nFor individual resource exceptions, use inline comments:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"public_assets\" {\n  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Public access required for static website hosting\n  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_19:Encryption handled at CDN layer\n  bucket = \"my-public-assets\"\n}\n```\n\n#### CLI-Based Skipping\n```bash\n# Skip specific checks\ncheckov -d . --skip-check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_19\n\n# Skip entire paths\ncheckov -d . --skip-path \"modules/legacy/*\"\n\n# Framework-specific scanning\ncheckov -d . --framework terraform --skip-check CKV2_AWS_6\n```\n\n#### Hard/Soft Fail Configuration for CI/CD\n```bash\n# Soft fail on specific checks (won't break pipeline)\ncheckov -d . --soft-fail-on CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_19\n\n# Hard fail only on critical checks\ncheckov -d . --hard-fail-on HIGH,CRITICAL\n\n# Combine both for granular control\ncheckov -d . --soft-fail-on LOW,MEDIUM --hard-fail-on HIGH\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **tfsec Configuration Management**\n\n#### Configuration File (`.tfsec/config.yml`)\nCreate a `.tfsec/config.yml` file in your repository root:\n\n```yaml\n# Exclude specific checks globally\nexclude:\n  - aws-s3-enable-versioning\n  - aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr\n  - CUS002\n\n# Override severity levels\nseverity_overrides:\n  aws-s3-enable-versioning: LOW\n  aws-ec2-enforce-http-token-imds: ERROR\n  CUS002: WARNING\n\n# Minimum severity to report (filter noise)\nminimum_severity: MEDIUM\n```\n\n#### Inline Ignore Directives\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"allow_https\" {\n  #tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr\n  type        = \"ingress\"\n  from_port   = 443\n  to_port     = 443\n  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### Expiring Ignores (Time-Bound Exceptions)\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr:exp:2026-06-30\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"temporary_access\" {\n  # This exception expires on June 30, 2026\n}\n```\n\n#### Workspace-Specific Ignores\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-versioning:ws:development\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"dev_logs\" {\n  # Only ignored in development workspace\n}\n```\n\n#### Value-Specific Ignores (for `for_each`)\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr[from_port=443]\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"multi_port\" {\n  for_each = toset([\"22\", \"443\", \"8080\"])\n  # Only port 443 is ignored\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Production CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices (2026)**\n\n#### GitHub Actions Example\n```yaml\nname: Terraform Security Scan\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - '**/*.tf'\n\njobs:\n  security-scan:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Run Checkov\n        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@v12\n        with:\n          directory: .\n          framework: terraform\n          baseline: .checkov.baseline\n          soft_fail_on: LOW,MEDIUM\n          output_format: sarif\n          output_file_path: checkov-results.sarif\n\n      - name: Run tfsec\n        uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1\n        with:\n          working_directory: .\n          soft_fail: false\n          format: sarif\n          sarif_file: tfsec-results.sarif\n\n      - name: Upload SARIF results\n        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3\n        with:\n          sarif_file: .\n```\n\n#### GitLab CI Example\n```yaml\ncheckov-scan:\n  stage: validate\n  image: bridgecrew/checkov:latest\n  script:\n    - checkov -d . \n        --framework terraform \n        --baseline .checkov.baseline \n        --soft-fail-on LOW,MEDIUM \n        --hard-fail-on HIGH,CRITICAL \n        --output cli \n        --output junitxml \n        --output-file-path console,checkov-results.xml\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      junit: checkov-results.xml\n  rules:\n    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == \"merge_request_event\"'\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Exception Governance Best Practices**\n\n| Practice | Implementation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Document all exceptions** | Require suppression comments explaining *why* |\n| **Time-bound exceptions** | Use expiration dates (`exp:YYYY-MM-DD`) |\n| **Regular baseline reviews** | Regenerate baselines quarterly |\n| **Severity-based gates** | Hard fail on HIGH/CRITICAL, soft fail on LOW/MEDIUM |\n| **Audit trail** | Store baseline files in version control |\n| **Environment-specific** | Use workspace scoping for dev vs prod |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Key 2026 Updates**\n\n1. **tfsec is now part of Trivy** -

Let me provide a complete answer on managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in production for 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Managing Terraform Security Scanning Baseline Exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in Production (2026)\n\n### 1. **Checkov Baseline Management**\n\n#### Creating and Using Baselines\nCheckov provides a powerful baseline feature to manage exceptions at scale:\n\n```bash\n# Create a baseline file capturing current state\ncheckov -d /path/to/terraform --create-baseline\n\n# This generates .checkov.baseline in the directory\n\n# Run subsequent scans comparing against the baseline\ncheckov -d /path/to/terraform --baseline /path/to/.checkov.baseline\n```\n\nThe baseline file captures all current findings, so future scans only report *new* issues introduced after the baseline was established.\n\n#### Inline Skip Directives\nFor individual resource exceptions, use inline comments:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"public_assets\" {\n  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Public access required for static website hosting\n  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_19:Encryption handled at CDN layer\n  bucket = \"my-public-assets\"\n}\n```\n\n#### CLI-Based Skipping\n```bash\n# Skip specific checks\ncheckov -d . --skip-check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_19\n\n# Skip entire paths\ncheckov -d . --skip-path \"modules/legacy/*\"\n\n# Framework-specific scanning\ncheckov -d . --framework terraform --skip-check CKV2_AWS_6\n```\n\n#### Hard/Soft Fail Configuration for CI/CD\n```bash\n# Soft fail on specific checks (won't break pipeline)\ncheckov -d . --soft-fail-on CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_19\n\n# Hard fail only on critical checks\ncheckov -d . --hard-fail-on HIGH,CRITICAL\n\n# Combine both for granular control\ncheckov -d . --soft-fail-on LOW,MEDIUM --hard-fail-on HIGH\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **tfsec Configuration Management**\n\n#### Configuration File (`.tfsec/config.yml`)\nCreate a `.tfsec/config.yml` file in your repository root:\n\n```yaml\n# Exclude specific checks globally\nexclude:\n  - aws-s3-enable-versioning\n  - aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr\n  - CUS002\n\n# Override severity levels\nseverity_overrides:\n  aws-s3-enable-versioning: LOW\n  aws-ec2-enforce-http-token-imds: ERROR\n  CUS002: WARNING\n\n# Minimum severity to report (filter noise)\nminimum_severity: MEDIUM\n```\n\n#### Inline Ignore Directives\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"allow_https\" {\n  #tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr\n  type        = \"ingress\"\n  from_port   = 443\n  to_port     = 443\n  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### Expiring Ignores (Time-Bound Exceptions)\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr:exp:2026-06-30\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"temporary_access\" {\n  # This exception expires on June 30, 2026\n}\n```\n\n#### Workspace-Specific Ignores\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-versioning:ws:development\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"dev_logs\" {\n  # Only ignored in development workspace\n}\n```\n\n#### Value-Specific Ignores (for `for_each`)\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-vpc-no-public-ingress-sgr[from_port=443]\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"multi_port\" {\n  for_each = toset([\"22\", \"443\", \"8080\"])\n  # Only port 443 is ignored\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Production CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices (2026)**\n\n#### GitHub Actions Example\n```yaml\nname: Terraform Security Scan\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - '**/*.tf'\n\njobs:\n  security-scan:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Run Checkov\n        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@v12\n        with:\n          directory: .\n          framework: terraform\n          baseline: .checkov.baseline\n          soft_fail_on: LOW,MEDIUM\n          output_format: sarif\n          output_file_path: checkov-results.sarif\n\n      - name: Run tfsec\n        uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1\n        with:\n          working_directory: .\n          soft_fail: false\n          format: sarif\n          sarif_file: tfsec-results.sarif\n\n      - name: Upload SARIF results\n        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3\n        with:\n          sarif_file: .\n```\n\n#### GitLab CI Example\n```yaml\ncheckov-scan:\n  stage: validate\n  image: bridgecrew/checkov:latest\n  script:\n    - checkov -d . \n        --framework terraform \n        --baseline .checkov.baseline \n        --soft-fail-on LOW,MEDIUM \n        --hard-fail-on HIGH,CRITICAL \n        --output cli \n        --output junitxml \n        --output-file-path console,checkov-results.xml\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      junit: checkov-results.xml\n  rules:\n    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == \"merge_request_event\"'\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Exception Governance Best Practices**\n\n| Practice | Implementation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Document all exceptions** | Require suppression comments explaining *why* |\n| **Time-bound exceptions** | Use expiration dates (`exp:YYYY-MM-DD`) |\n| **Regular baseline reviews** | Regenerate baselines quarterly |\n| **Severity-based gates** | Hard fail on HIGH/CRITICAL, soft fail on LOW/MEDIUM |\n| **Audit trail** | Store baseline files in version control |\n| **Environment-specific** | Use workspace scoping for dev vs prod |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Key 2026 Updates**\n\n1. **tfsec is now part of Trivy** - Aqua Security merged tfsec into Trivy. Consider migrating to `trivy config` for future-proofing:\n   ```bash\n   trivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --skip-dirs .terraform .\n   ```\n\n2. **Checkov 3.x baseline improvements** - Baseline files now support directory-level scoping and better graph policy handling.\n\n3. **SARIF output** - Both tools now output SARIF format for GitHub Security tab integration.\n\n4. **Policy-as-Code integration** - Consider combining with OPA/Sentinel for organization-wide policy enforcement beyond individual exceptions.","timestamp":88426}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"Terraform","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769688047335,"end":1769688135761,"firstResponse":88426,"sessionCreation":0,"total":88426},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).
