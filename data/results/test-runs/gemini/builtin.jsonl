However, since the query explicitly asks for the *current* week report of *2025*, and it is impossible to know what a future week's report will contain, the response is slightly flawed because the year 2025 is in the future, making the request impossible to fulfill now. It still correctly identifies the CFTC website and general procedure, so it is not completely wrong, but the 2025 aspect detracts from the complete relevance.

The link works and the explanation of how to find the reports on the CFTC site is accurate.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":false,"mcpToolCalled":false,"deterministicScore":60,"llmScore":35,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false}}}
