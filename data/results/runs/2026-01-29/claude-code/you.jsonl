{"id":"websearch-2","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","output":"Based on my research using ydc-server, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026:\n\n## Landing Page Strategies for 2026\n\n### 1. **Story-Driven Hero Sections**\nMove beyond static taglines to narrative headlines that show your product value instantly. Companies like Notion, Linear, and Framer demonstrate the \"before → after\" arc visually in the hero section, using animation and micro-interactions to illustrate product workflows.\n\n### 2. **Personalized CTAs and Dynamic Value Props**\nOne-size-fits-all CTAs are fading. Implement:\n- Audience segmentation (startup vs enterprise, B2C vs B2B)\n- Dynamic text based on visitor context\n- Interactive inputs to adapt messaging\n- Benefit-driven language instead of generic \"Sign up\" buttons\n\n### 3. **Immersive Product Previews**\nScreenshots are evolving into interactive components. Leading brands embed product demos, guided tours, and interactive elements right in the hero section. Tools like Guideflow enable these immersive experiences, with companies like Amplitude seeing higher engagement from interactive demos.\n\n### 4. **AI-Assisted Design**\nAI tools are streamlining workflows:\n- AI-generated headlines, copy, and CTAs based on product context\n- Custom illustrations that align with brand style\n- Dynamic personalization based on visitor behavior and traffic source\n- Design-to-code workflows reducing concept-to-implementation time by up to 80%\n\n### 5. **Conversion-Optimized Navigation**\n- Sticky primary CTAs always visible\n- Action-focused labels (\"Schedule a demo\", \"Try for free\")\n- Reduced extraneous links to minimize distraction\n- Anchor links guiding users to key sections\n\n## Responsive Design Patterns for Galleries\n\n### 1. **Container Queries Over Media Queries**\nThe biggest shift in 2026 is adopting container queries instead of viewport-based media queries. Components adapt based on their parent container's size rather than screen size, creating truly context-aware responsive designs:\n\n```css\n.card-container {\n  container-type: inline-size;\n}\n\n@container (min-width: 19rem) {\n  .card-content {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Grid + Flexbox Hybrid Layouts**\n- Use CSS Grid for overall gallery structure and two-dimensional layouts\n- Use Flexbox for component-level layouts and one-dimensional arrangements\n- Modern 12-column responsive grid systems that adapt across viewport sizes\n\n### 3. **Fluid Typography with Viewport Scaling**\nUse the `clamp()` function for typography that scales smoothly without breakpoints:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n  font-size: clamp(1rem, 1rem + 0.24vw, 1.25rem);\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Touch-Optimized Interactions**\n- Minimum touch target size of 44-48dp (about 9mm)\n- Place interactive elements within natural thumb reach zones\n- Provide immediate visual, sound, or haptic feedback\n- 75% of users navigate with thumbs, so prioritize thumb-friendly zones\n\n## Pricing Table Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Be Concise**\nShow differences between plans, not similarities. Place distinctive features at the top and common features at the bottom.\n\n### 2. **Make Prices Stand Out**\nUse appropriate font weight and semantic HTML. Consider charm pricing (prices ending in 9) which studies show can double conversions in some cases.\n\n### 3. **Highlight the Best Option**\nUse ribbons (\"Most Popular\", \"Best Value\"), drop shadows, or visual hierarchy to guide users to your recommended plan.\n\n### 4. **Split-Screen Layouts**\nUse split-screen comparisons for:\n- Problem vs Solution visualization\n- Before/After product comparison\n- Different user personas or use cases\n- Feature or plan comparison\n\n### 5. **Responsive Pricing Tables**\nImplement:\n- Container queries so pricing tables adapt to their parent container\n- Mobile-first design with stacked layouts on small screens\n- Touch-friendly CTAs and interactive elements\n- Lazy loading and code splitting for performance\n\n### 6. **Visual Consistency**\nUse visuals sparingly - avoid excessive checkmarks and crosses. Maintain consistency with overall site design, and ensure pricing tables follow your brand's color system and typography.\n\n### 7. **Live Chat Support**\n38% of people became customers because they could ask pre-sales questions. Add live chat on pricing pages to address objections.\n\n### 8. **Component-Driven Development**\nBuild pricing tables using atomic design methodology - breaking interfaces into reusable atoms, molecules, and organisms. This approach reduces development time by up to 35% and improves design consistency by 20%.\n\n## Performance Patterns\n\n### 1. **Lazy Loading and Code Splitting**\nUse React's `lazy()` function with Suspense to load components only when needed, dramatically improving initial page load times.\n\n### 2. **Tree Shaking**\nRemove unused code during bundling to reduce bundle size. Mark files as side-effect-free in package.json.\n\n### 3. **Dark Mode with CSS Variables**\nImplement theming through CSS variables for easy dark mode switching:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --body-color: white;\n  --font-color: black;\n}\n\n[data-dark-mode] {\n  --body-color: black;\n  --font-color: white;\n}\n```\n\n## Sources:\n- [10 SaaS Landing Page Trends for 2026 (with Real Examples) - SaaSFrame](https://www.saasframe.io/blog/10-saas-landing-page-trends-for-2026-with-real-examples)\n- [Frontend Design Patterns That Actually Work in 2026 - Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/frontend-design-patterns)\n- [11 Pricing Table Best practices and Ideas for Conversion - Ninja Tables](https://ninjatables.com/pricing-table-best-practices/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026.","timestamp":58928},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":58928},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":58928},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":58928},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01TXhh15WXqsXSytdiVs9khh","status":"completed","timestamp":58928},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SUBaLbRJn46MDv2syCiB3M","status":"completed","timestamp":58928},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RKVaseC7QUeKZ4v9dEowRP","status":"completed","timestamp":58928},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed content from some of these key articles to provide you with comprehensive information.","timestamp":58928},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":58928},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YYkbCktMoKAMty778zz17Y","status":"completed","timestamp":58928},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research using ydc-server, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026:\n\n## Landing Page Strategies for 2026\n\n### 1. **Story-Driven Hero Sections**\nMove beyond static taglines to narrative headlines that show your product value instantly.

It consists of two key components:\n\n1. **Azure AI Foundry Hub** - The parent resource providing shared infrastructure, security, networking, and centralized management across multiple projects\n2. **Azure AI Foundry Projects** - Individual workspaces within a hub where actual AI development happens (model deployment, training, etc.)\n\n### Deployment Approaches\n\nThere are two main ways to deploy GPT models using Pulumi:\n\n#### Approach 1: Using Azure OpenAI Service (Recommended for 2026)\n\nThis approach creates a Cognitive Services account with OpenAI capabilities and deploys GPT models.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- Azure subscription with access to Azure OpenAI\n- Pulumi CLI installed\n- Azure CLI installed and logged in\n- Pulumi project initialized\n\n**Example Code (TypeScript):**\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// Create Resource Group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"ai-rg\", {\n    resourceGroupName: \"rg-ai-foundry\",\n    location: \"eastus\",\n});\n\n// Create Cognitive Services Account (Azure OpenAI)\nconst openAiAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    accountName: \"openai-foundry-account\",\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\",\n    },\n    properties: {\n        publicNetworkAccess: \"Enabled\",\n    },\n});\n\n// Deploy GPT-4o Model\nconst gptDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    accountName: openAiAccount.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-4o-deployment\",\n    sku: {\n        name: \"GlobalStandard\",\n        capacity: 50,\n    },\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-4o\",\n            version: \"2024-11-20\", // Use latest version available in 2026\n        },\n        raiPolicyName: \"Microsoft.Default\",\n    },\n});\n\n// Extract API Keys\nconst keys = azure_native.cognitiveservices.listAccountKeysOutput({\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    accountName: openAiAccount.name,\n});\n\n// Export endpoints and keys\nexport const endpoint = openAiAccount.properties.endpoint;\nexport const apiKey = keys.key1;\nexport const deploymentName = gptDeployment.name;\n```\n\n**Example Code (Python):**\n\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport pulumi_azure_native as azure_native\n\n# Create Resource Group\nresource_group = azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\n    \"ai-rg\",\n    resource_group_name=\"rg-ai-foundry\",\n    location=\"eastus\"\n)\n\n# Create Cognitive Services Account (Azure OpenAI)\nopenai_account = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\n    \"openai-account\",\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    location=resource_group.location,\n    account_name=\"openai-foundry-account\",\n    kind=\"OpenAI\",\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"S0\"\n    ),\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.AccountPropertiesArgs(\n        public_network_access=\"Enabled\"\n    )\n)\n\n# Deploy GPT-4o Model\ngpt_deployment = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\n    \"gpt-deployment\",\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    account_name=openai_account.name,\n    deployment_name=\"gpt-4o-deployment\",\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"GlobalStandard\",\n        capacity=50\n    ),\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentPropertiesArgs(\n        model=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentModelArgs(\n            format=\"OpenAI\",\n            name=\"gpt-4o\",\n            version=\"2024-11-20\"\n        ),\n        rai_policy_name=\"Microsoft.Default\"\n    )\n)\n\n# Extract API Keys\nkeys = azure_native.cognitiveservices.list_account_keys_output(\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    account_name=openai_account.name\n)\n\n# Export outputs\npulumi.export(\"endpoint\", openai_account.properties.endpoint)\npulumi.export(\"api_key\", keys.key1)\npulumi.export(\"deployment_name\", gpt_deployment.name)\n```\n\n#### Approach 2: Using Azure AI Foundry Hub and Projects\n\nFor enterprise deployments requiring advanced governance, networking, and security controls, create a full AI Foundry Hub with projects:\n\n**Key Components to Provision:**\n\n1. **AI Hub** with:\n   - Security and networking configuration\n   - Shared storage resources\n   - Key Vault for credential management\n   - Container Registry\n   - Access control (RBAC/ABAC)\n\n2. **AI Project** under the hub with:\n   - Model deployments\n   - Endpoints\n   - Datasets and indexes\n\n**Note:** As of 2026, comprehensive Pulumi resources for Azure AI Foundry Hub and Projects may be available in the `azure-native` provider. Check the latest Pulumi Registry documentation for:\n- `azure-native.machinelearningservices.Workspace` (for AI Hub/Projects)\n- Related networking and security resources\n\n### Deployment Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Pulumi Project:**\n```bash\npulumi new azure-typescript  # or azure-python\n```\n\n2. **Configure Azure Region:**\n```bash\npulumi config set azure-native:location eastus\n```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies:**\n```bash\n# TypeScript\nnpm install @pulumi/azure-native\n\n# Python\npip install pulumi-azure-native\n```\n\n4. **Deploy Infrastructure:**\n```bash\npulumi up\n```\n\n5. **Use the Deployed Model:**\nAfter deployment, use the exported endpoint and API key to access your GPT model via REST API or Azure SDK.\n\n### Available GPT Models in 2026\n\nBased on current trends, you can deploy various models including:\n- **GPT-5** and **GPT-5.2** (latest as of 2026)\n- **GPT-4.1** series\n- **GPT-4o** (optimized version)\n- **GPT-OSS** (OpenAI's open-source model)\n- Earlier versions like GPT-4, GPT-3.5\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Security:** Use private endpoints for production deployments\n2. **Cost Management:** Set appropriate token limits and capacity\n3. **Monitoring:** Enable diagnostic logging and monitoring\n4. **Identity:** Use managed identities for authentication between Azure services\n5. **Storage:** Configure dedicated storage accounts for model artifacts\n6. **Networking:** Implement proper inbound/outbound access controls for enterprise deployments\n\n### Key Differences: Azure AI Foundry vs Azure OpenAI\n\n- **Azure OpenAI**: Direct access to OpenAI models with Azure security\n- **Azure AI Foundry**: Comprehensive platform for full AI lifecycle including 1900+ models, MLOps/LLMOps, RAG applications, and enterprise governance\n\nChoose Azure OpenAI (Approach 1) if you specifically need OpenAI models. Choose Azure AI Foundry (Approach 2) if you need comprehensive ML model management, team collaboration, and enterprise controls.\n\n## Sources:\n- [How to Provision Azure OpenAI with Pulumi in C#](https://blog.byalex.dev/article/azure-openai-pulumi/)\n- [How to Setup Azure AI Foundry: Create Hub, Projects & Deploy LLM Models](https://devopscube.com/setup-azure-ai-foundry/)\n- [Pulumi Azure Native Deployment Documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/azure-native/api-docs/cognitiveservices/deployment/)\n- [How to deploy Azure OpenAI models with Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models-openai)\n- [GPT-5 in Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/gpt-5-in-azure-ai-foundry-the-future-of-ai-apps-and-agents-starts-here/)\n- [Announcing GPT‑5.2‑Codex in Microsoft Foundry](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/announcing-gpt%E2%80%915-2%E2%80%91codex-in-microsoft-foundry-enterprise%E2%80%91grade-ai-for-secure-sof/4485379)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about deploying GPT models to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026.","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014uqCocSrRGWedCzr1PSkzY","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information about using Pulumi with Azure AI Foundry.","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EnJs9LJiSbAUwMBP51ynd7","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CjLE3ZqFq65kS9joFXn2ma","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific Pulumi Azure OpenAI and Azure AI documentation.","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FYsPwuHVFaTdimVKBD2NSK","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0148tpUmaM2RHBihinxkV51y","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch detailed content from the key Pulumi documentation pages.","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01T4UhozjdsWw1qF2RzVcoi3","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SUzuicHA4wZuN9jHnL7Vvf","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018W3VVbWmC5ouJ9km4LK3jZ","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HCwKASYAQWmhNmiB2eH2ku","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for a more focused example.","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Wm51p7HQ2WHoQoSSmTkQHG","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PC5y7e56F4PXJWny2Mnaty","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me get information specifically about Azure AI Foundry structure and how it differs from regular Azure OpenAI.","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WZoo2GYPP17bCtCu7rz5n1","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":114741},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014kTDUXSUiL9Aatue9NKSrd","status":"completed","timestamp":114741},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on deploying GPT models to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026:\n\n## How to Deploy a GPT Model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026\n\n### Understanding Azure AI Foundry Architecture\n\nAzure AI Foundry is Microsoft's managed platform for the entire AI application lifecycle.

Now I have comprehensive information about migrating from `@google/generative-ai` to `@google/genai`. Let me provide you with a clear summary.\n\n# How to Migrate from @google/generative-ai to @google/genai\n\n## Overview\n\nStarting with the Gemini 2.0 release in late 2024, Google introduced the **Google GenAI SDK** (`@google/genai`) as a replacement for the older `@google/generative-ai` package. This new SDK provides:\n\n- A centralized `Client` architecture\n- Better developer experience\n- Improved consistency across API methods\n- Support for Gemini 2.0+ features\n- Easier transition between developer and enterprise workflows\n\nThe new SDK is now **Generally Available (GA)** and is recommended for all new projects.\n\n## Key Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Installation\n\n**Before:**\n```bash\nnpm install @google/generative-ai\n```\n\n**After:**\n```bash\nnpm install @google/genai\n```\n\n### 2. Client Initialization\n\n**Before (Old SDK):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenerativeAI } from \"@google/generative-ai\";\n\nconst genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\n```\n\n**After (New SDK):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenAI } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({apiKey: \"YOUR_API_KEY\"});\n// Access all services through the centralized client\n```\n\n### 3. Generate Content\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\nconst result = await model.generateContent(prompt);\nconsole.log(result.response.text());\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Tell me a story in 300 words.\",\n});\nconsole.log(response.text);\n```\n\n### 4. Streaming\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst result = await model.generateContentStream(prompt);\nfor await (const chunk of result.stream) {\n  console.log(chunk.text());\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Write a story about a magic backpack.\",\n});\nfor await (const chunk of response) {\n  console.log(chunk.text);\n}\n```\n\n### 5.

Now I have comprehensive information about migrating from `@google/generative-ai` to `@google/genai`. Let me provide you with a clear summary.\n\n# How to Migrate from @google/generative-ai to @google/genai\n\n## Overview\n\nStarting with the Gemini 2.0 release in late 2024, Google introduced the **Google GenAI SDK** (`@google/genai`) as a replacement for the older `@google/generative-ai` package. This new SDK provides:\n\n- A centralized `Client` architecture\n- Better developer experience\n- Improved consistency across API methods\n- Support for Gemini 2.0+ features\n- Easier transition between developer and enterprise workflows\n\nThe new SDK is now **Generally Available (GA)** and is recommended for all new projects.\n\n## Key Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Installation\n\n**Before:**\n```bash\nnpm install @google/generative-ai\n```\n\n**After:**\n```bash\nnpm install @google/genai\n```\n\n### 2. Client Initialization\n\n**Before (Old SDK):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenerativeAI } from \"@google/generative-ai\";\n\nconst genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\n```\n\n**After (New SDK):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenAI } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({apiKey: \"YOUR_API_KEY\"});\n// Access all services through the centralized client\n```\n\n### 3. Generate Content\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\nconst result = await model.generateContent(prompt);\nconsole.log(result.response.text());\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Tell me a story in 300 words.\",\n});\nconsole.log(response.text);\n```\n\n### 4. Streaming\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst result = await model.generateContentStream(prompt);\nfor await (const chunk of result.stream) {\n  console.log(chunk.text());\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Write a story about a magic backpack.\",\n});\nfor await (const chunk of response) {\n  console.log(chunk.text);\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Chat Sessions\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst chat = model.startChat({ history: [...] });\nlet result = await chat.sendMessage(\"Hello\");\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst chat = ai.chats.create({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  history: [...],\n});\nconst response = await chat.sendMessage({ message: \"Hello\" });\n```\n\n### 6.

Use TypedDict for compile-time safety\n- **Deterministic mutations** - State changes are explicit and traceable\n- **Serializable** - All state can be persisted to databases\n- **Replayable** - You can reconstruct agent behavior from state snapshots\n\n### 2. **Checkpointing for Long-Term Memory**\n\nFor persistent memory across sessions, use **checkpoint savers**:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\n\n# Local development\ncheckpointer = SqliteSaver(\"agent_memory.db\")\n\n# Production (2026 standard)\ncheckpointer = PostgresSaver(connection_string=\"postgresql://...\")\n\napp = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Run with session memory\nresult = app.invoke(\n    {\"question\": \"What did we discuss?\"},\n    config={\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"user_123\"}}\n)\n```\n\n**What this enables:**\n- Crash recovery\n- Multi-turn conversations\n- Human-in-the-loop approvals\n- Audit trails for compliance\n- Session persistence\n\n### 3. **Memory Injection Patterns**\n\n**Pattern A: Pre-loading Context**\n```python\ndef retrieval_node(state):\n    # Inject RAG context into state\n    question = state[\"question\"]\n    documents = vectorstore.similarity_search(question, k=5)\n    \n    return {\n        \"documents\": documents,\n        \"question\": question\n    }\n```\n\n**Pattern B: Memory Accumulation**\n```python\nfrom operator import add\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    # Use Annotated to define merge behavior\n    memory: Annotated[List[str], add]  # Appends instead of replacing\n    \ngraph.add_node(\"step1\", lambda s: {\"memory\": [\"Retrieved docs\"]})\ngraph.add_node(\"step2\", lambda s: {\"memory\": [\"Generated answer\"]})\n# Final state.memory = [\"Retrieved docs\", \"Generated answer\"]\n```\n\n**Pattern C: External Memory Integration (2026 Standard)**\n```python\nfrom langchain.memory import MongoDBChatMessageHistory\n\ndef inject_user_context(state):\n    user_id = state.get(\"user_id\")\n    \n    # Load long-term memory from MongoDB\n    history = MongoDBChatMessageHistory(\n        connection_string=\"mongodb://...\",\n        session_id=user_id\n    )\n    \n    return {\n        \"conversation_history\": history.messages,\n        \"user_preferences\": load_user_profile(user_id)\n    }\n\ngraph.add_node(\"load_memory\", inject_user_context)\ngraph.set_entry_point(\"load_memory\")\n```\n\n## RAG Context Injection (2026 Agentic Pattern)\n\n### 4. **Self-Correcting RAG Architecture**\n\nThe 2026 standard is **Agentic RAG** with these nodes:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n\nworkflow = StateGraph(GraphState)\n\n# Node 1: Retrieve\ndef retrieve(state):\n    docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(state[\"question\"])\n    return {\"documents\": docs}\n\n# Node 2: Grade relevance (KEY 2026 PATTERN)\ndef grade_documents(state):\n    grader_llm = llm.with_structured_output(GradeDocuments)\n    \n    filtered_docs = []\n    for doc in state[\"documents\"]:\n        score = grader_llm.invoke({\n            \"question\": state[\"question\"],\n            \"document\": doc.page_content\n        })\n        if score.binary_score == \"yes\":\n            filtered_docs.append(doc)\n    \n    return {\"documents\": filtered_docs}\n\n# Node 3: Conditional routing\ndef decide_to_generate(state):\n    if not state[\"documents\"]:\n        return \"rewrite_query\"  # Loop back\n    return \"generate\"\n\n# Node 4: Query rewriting (self-correction)\ndef transform_query(state):\n    rewriter = prompt | llm\n    better_question = rewriter.invoke({\"question\": state[\"question\"]})\n    return {\"question\": better_question}\n\n# Build graph\nworkflow.add_node(\"retrieve\", retrieve)\nworkflow.add_node(\"grade\", grade_documents)\nworkflow.add_node(\"generate\", generate)\nworkflow.add_node(\"rewrite\", transform_query)\n\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"retrieve\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"retrieve\", \"grade\")\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"grade\",\n    decide_to_generate,\n    {\n        \"rewrite_query\": \"rewrite\",\n        \"generate\": \"generate\"\n    }\n)\nworkflow.add_edge(\"rewrite\", \"retrieve\")  # Loop\nworkflow.add_edge(\"generate\", END)\n```\n\n### 5. **Context Injection Best Practices (2026)**\n\n**A. Use Structured Output for Grading**\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass RelevanceScore(BaseModel):\n    score: str = Field(description=\"'yes' or 'no'\")\n    reasoning: str = Field(description=\"Why this score?\")\n\ngrader = llm.with_structured_output(RelevanceScore)\n```\n\n**B. Add Hallucination Checks**\n```python\ndef check_hallucination(state):\n    checker_prompt = \"\"\"Is this answer grounded in the documents?\n    Answer: {generation}\n    Documents: {documents}\n    \"\"\"\n    result = llm.invoke(checker_prompt.format(**state))\n    \n    if \"not grounded\" in result.lower():\n        return \"regenerate\"\n    return \"done\"\n\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\"generate\", check_hallucination)\n```\n\n**C. Multi-Source RAG (2026 Advanced)**\n```python\ndef hybrid_retrieval(state):\n    # Vector search\n    vector_docs = chroma.search(state[\"question\"])\n    \n    # BM25 keyword search\n    bm25_docs = bm25_retriever.search(state[\"question\"])\n    \n    # Web search fallback\n    if not vector_docs:\n        web_docs = tavily_search(state[\"question\"])\n        return {\"documents\": web_docs, \"source\": \"web\"}\n    \n    # Merge with reciprocal rank fusion\n    merged = reciprocal_rank_fusion([vector_docs, bm25_docs])\n    return {\"documents\": merged}\n```\n\n### 6. **Production Memory Patterns (2026)**\n\n**Redis for Fast State Access**\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.redis import RedisSaver\n\ncheckpointer = RedisSaver(\n    host=\"redis.example.com\",\n    ttl=3600  # 1 hour session memory\n)\n```\n\n**MongoDB for Long-Term Agent Memory**\n```python\nfrom langchain.memory import MongoDBChatMessageHistory\n\nmemory = MongoDBChatMessageHistory(\n    connection_string=\"mongodb+srv://...\",\n    session_id=user_id,\n    database_name=\"agent_memory\",\n    collection_name=\"conversations\"\n)\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways for 2026\n\n1. **State is everything** - Use strongly typed TypedDict, never rely on implicit state\n2. **Checkpointing is mandatory** - Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB in production, SQLite for dev\n3. **Agentic RAG is the standard** - Linear retrieve→generate is obsolete; use grading and self-correction loops\n4. **Memory injection happens at nodes** - Load user context, conversation history, and preferences explicitly\n5. **Use conditional edges for control** - Don't let LLMs fail blindly; route based on quality checks\n\nSources:\n- [LangGraph Explained (2026 Edition) -

{"id":"websearch-212","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?","output":"Based on the latest information from 2024-2025, here's how to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDocker directly manipulates `iptables`, inserting ACCEPT rules into its own DOCKER chain that execute **before** UFW's rules are evaluated. This means published container ports become publicly accessible even when UFW appears to deny them.\n\n## The Solution: Modify UFW Configuration\n\nThis approach requires modifying only one UFW configuration file while keeping all Docker settings at their defaults.\n\n### Step 1: Edit UFW After Rules\n\nEdit `/etc/ufw/after.rules` and add the following at the end of the file:\n\n```bash\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [0:0]\n:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [0:0]\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 172.16.0.0/12\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] \"\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\n### Step 2: Restart UFW\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw reload\n# or\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n```\n\nIf rules don't take effect, reboot the server.\n\n## What This Does\n\n- **Blocks external traffic**: Public networks cannot access any published Docker ports by default\n- **Allows internal communication**: Containers on private networks (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) can still communicate\n- **Preserves outbound access**: Containers can access external networks normally\n- **Enables logging**: Blocked attempts are logged with prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK]\"\n\n## Allowing Public Access to Specific Containers\n\nAfter applying the fix, explicitly allow public access when needed:\n\n**Allow any container on port 80:**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to any port 80\n```\n\n**Allow a specific container (by its IP):**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to 172.17.0.2 port 80\n```\n\n**Allow UDP services (like DNS):**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto udp from any to any port 53\n```\n\n## Why This Works\n\nThe solution uses Docker's **DOCKER-USER** chain, which sits before Docker's own rules in the packet flow. By routing traffic through UFW's chains (`ufw-user-forward`) first, UFW becomes the authority on what traffic is allowed, restoring proper firewall control without breaking Docker's networking features.\n\nSources:\n- [Why Docker Bypassed My UFW Firewall & How You Can Fix It](https://rithwik.hashnode.dev/how-docker-can-be-sneaky-around-your-ufw-firewall)\n- [Docker, UFW, and the Hidden Firewall Bypass: A Deep Technical Breakdown](https://blogs.srikanthkarthi.tech/blog/docker-ufw-firewall-bypass)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about preventing Docker from bypassing UFW firewall rules.","timestamp":32559},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":32559},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019CFZsB7wUUXks1XMzHFYUu","status":"completed","timestamp":32559},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from these sources.","timestamp":32559},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":32559},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Dz1qi5368568Y96XJSYZ6p","status":"completed","timestamp":32559},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest information from 2024-2025, here's how to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDocker directly manipulates `iptables`, inserting ACCEPT rules into its own DOCKER chain that execute **before** UFW's rules are evaluated.

**Deterministic pre-execution**: Reduces WAN bandwidth consumption by pre-executing transactions locally before replication, detecting conflicts early\n   - **Mini-batch partitioning**: Partitions large transaction batches into smaller mini-batches to reduce concurrent conflicts\n   - **Deterministic re-execution**: Re-executes aborted transactions in subsequent epochs rather than returning them to clients\n\n3. **Performance Results**:\n   - 17.8% reduction in network bandwidth consumption\n   - 5.1% throughput increase compared to baseline systems\n   - Near-zero abort rates under high-contention workloads\n\n4. **System Implementation**: Built on NeuChain, a fast permissioned blockchain using Aria's deterministic concurrency control\n\n### **Related 2025 Research:**\n\n**\"SoK: Concurrency in Blockchain - A Systematic Literature Review\"** (arXiv:2506.01885v1, June 2025)\n- Provides a systematic overview of concurrency mechanisms in blockchain systems\n\n**\"Concurrency Control as a Service\"** (ResearchGate, September 2025)\n- Explores service-oriented approaches to concurrency control\n\n### **Key Concurrency Control Systems Referenced:**\n\n1. **Calvin** (2012): Pre-ordering mechanism with lock-based DCC\n2. **Aria** (2020): No-ordering mechanism with batch execution\n3. **Gria** (2024): Multi-version control with automatic batch size adjustment\n4. **NeuChain** (2022): Fast permissioned blockchain with deterministic ordering\n5. **Spectrum** (2024): Strictly-deterministic smart contract transactions\n\n### **Research Focus Areas:**\n\nThe 2025 research emphasizes:\n- **Geo-distributed systems** with WAN constraints\n- **Reducing abort rates** in high-contention scenarios\n- **Bandwidth optimization** for distributed transaction processing\n- **Deterministic execution** to avoid coordination overhead\n- **Blockchain applications** in finance, commerce, and cloud storage\n\n### **Advisory Lock Context:**\n\nWhile the research doesn't specifically focus on \"advisory locks\" (application-level cooperative locking mechanisms like PostgreSQL's advisory locks), it addresses the broader challenge of concurrency control through deterministic approaches that eliminate the need for traditional locking mechanisms by:\n- Pre-determining transaction execution order\n- Detecting conflicts deterministically\n- Avoiding deadlocks through ordered execution\n\nSources:\n- [An optimized deterministic concurrency control approach for geo-distributed transaction processing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-00478-5)\n- [SoK: Concurrency in Blockchain -

Let me provide you with the key findings:\n\n## Latest 2025 Research on Database Concurrency Control\n\n### **Primary Research Paper (Published June 2025):**\n\n**\"An optimized deterministic concurrency control approach for geo-distributed transaction processing on permissioned blockchains\"**\n- Published in: *Scientific Reports* (Nature), Volume 15, Article 19238 (2025)\n- Authors: Han, Z., Peng, Z., Wang, G., et al. from Northeastern University, China\n- DOI: 10.1038/s41598-025-00478-5\n\n**Key Contributions:**\n\n1. **GB-DCC System**: An optimized deterministic concurrency control (DCC) algorithm designed for geographically distributed systems, particularly permissioned blockchains\n\n2. **Three Optimization Strategies**:\n   - **Deterministic pre-execution**: Reduces WAN bandwidth consumption by pre-executing transactions locally before replication, detecting conflicts early\n   - **Mini-batch partitioning**: Partitions large transaction batches into smaller mini-batches to reduce concurrent conflicts\n   - **Deterministic re-execution**: Re-executes aborted transactions in subsequent epochs rather than returning them to clients\n\n3. **Performance Results**:\n   - 17.8% reduction in network bandwidth consumption\n   - 5.1% throughput increase compared to baseline systems\n   - Near-zero abort rates under high-contention workloads\n\n4. **System Implementation**: Built on NeuChain, a fast permissioned blockchain using Aria's deterministic concurrency control\n\n### **Related 2025 Research:**\n\n**\"SoK: Concurrency in Blockchain - A Systematic Literature Review\"** (arXiv:2506.01885v1, June 2025)\n- Provides a systematic overview of concurrency mechanisms in blockchain systems\n\n**\"Concurrency Control as a Service\"** (ResearchGate, September 2025)\n- Explores service-oriented approaches to concurrency control\n\n### **Key Concurrency Control Systems Referenced:**\n\n1. **Calvin** (2012): Pre-ordering mechanism with lock-based DCC\n2. **Aria** (2020): No-ordering mechanism with batch execution\n3. **Gria** (2024): Multi-version control with automatic batch size adjustment\n4. **NeuChain** (2022): Fast permissioned blockchain with deterministic ordering\n5. **Spectrum** (2024): Strictly-deterministic smart contract transactions\n\n### **Research Focus Areas:**\n\nThe 2025 research emphasizes:\n- **Geo-distributed systems** with WAN constraints\n- **Reducing abort rates** in high-contention scenarios\n- **Bandwidth optimization** for distributed transaction processing\n- **Deterministic execution** to avoid coordination overhead\n- **Blockchain applications** in finance, commerce, and cloud storage\n\n### **Advisory Lock Context:**\n\nWhile the research doesn't specifically focus on \"advisory locks\" (application-level cooperative locking mechanisms like PostgreSQL's advisory locks), it addresses the broader challenge of concurrency control through deterministic approaches that eliminate the need for traditional locking mechanisms by:\n- Pre-determining transaction execution order\n- Detecting conflicts deterministically\n- Avoiding deadlocks through ordered execution\n\nSources:\n- [An optimized deterministic concurrency control approach for geo-distributed transaction processing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-00478-5)\n- [SoK: Concurrency in Blockchain - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.01885v1)\n- [Concurrency Control as a Service - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395259654_Concurrency_Control_as_a_Service)","timestamp":54540}],"metadata":{"category":"Research","subcategory":"Database concurrency","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769682326015,"end":1769682380555,"firstResponse":54540,"sessionCreation":0,"total":54540},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.86,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-557","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","output":"Based on my research, here are the best practices for handling optional array parameters in Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026:\n\n## Best Practices for Optional Array Parameters in Supabase RPC\n\n### 1. **Define Optional Parameters with DEFAULT NULL**\n\nIn your PostgreSQL function, make array parameters optional by setting a default value:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n  product_ids integer[],\n  override_data jsonb DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS void\nLANGUAGE plpgsql\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF override_data IS NOT NULL THEN\n    -- Process overrides\n  END IF;\nEND;$$\n```\n\n### 2. **Choose the Right Array Type**\n\nFor pricing overrides, you have two main options:\n\n**Option A: Custom Type (Strongly Typed)**\n```sql\nCREATE TYPE price_override AS (\n  product_id integer,\n  override_price numeric,\n  effective_date date\n);\n\nCREATE FUNCTION apply_overrides(overrides price_override[] DEFAULT NULL)\n...\n```\n\n**Option B: JSONB (Flexible)**\n```sql\nCREATE FUNCTION apply_overrides(overrides jsonb DEFAULT NULL)\n...\n-- Then use jsonb_to_recordset() to process:\nINSERT INTO price_overrides(product_id, override_price)\nSELECT product_id, override_price\nFROM jsonb_to_recordset(overrides)\n  AS x(product_id int, override_price numeric);\n```\n\n### 3. **Handle NULL Values Properly**\n\nAlways check if the optional parameter was provided:\n\n```sql\nIF overrides IS NULL OR jsonb_array_length(overrides) = 0 THEN\n  -- Skip override logic\n  RETURN;\nEND IF;\n```\n\n### 4. **Client-Side Invocation**\n\nWhen calling from JavaScript, you can omit optional parameters:\n\n```javascript\n// With overrides\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  product_ids: [1, 2, 3],\n  override_data: [\n    { product_id: 1, override_price: 99.99 },\n    { product_id: 2, override_price: 149.99 }\n  ]\n});\n\n// Without overrides - parameter can be omitted or set to null\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  product_ids: [1, 2, 3]\n  // override_data is optional\n});\n```\n\n### 5. **Parameter Ordering Rules**\n\nIn PostgreSQL, all parameters following a parameter with a default value must also have default values.

Structure your function signature accordingly:\n\n```sql\n-- Correct\nCREATE FUNCTION fn(required_param int, optional_array int[] DEFAULT NULL)\n\n-- Incorrect - won't work\nCREATE FUNCTION fn(optional_array int[] DEFAULT NULL, required_param int)\n```\n\n### 6. **Use Named Parameters for Clarity**\n\nWhen some optional parameters are omitted, use named notation:\n\n```javascript\nawait supabase.rpc('complex_pricing', {\n  product_ids: [1, 2, 3],\n  // skip optional middle parameters\n  apply_seasonal: true\n});\n```\n\n### Key Recommendations for Pricing Overrides\n\n1. **Use JSONB for flexibility** - Pricing structures may evolve, and JSONB allows schema changes without function updates\n2. **Validate data in the function** - Check for required fields and valid ranges\n3. **Make it transactional** - Wrap override applications in BEGIN/COMMIT blocks\n4. **Add audit logging** - Track who applied overrides and when\n5. **Use COALESCE for defaults** - `COALESCE(overrides, '[]'::jsonb)` to ensure you always have an array to work with\n\n## Sources\n\n- [JavaScript API Reference | Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/rpc)\n- [send array of objects in supabase rpc parameters · supabase · Discussion #3030](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/3030)\n- [Sql: Creating PostgreSQL Functions with Optional Parameters: A Guide](https://copyprogramming.com/howto/how-to-write-function-for-optional-parameters-in-postgresql)\n- [PostgreSQL: Documentation: 18: CREATE FUNCTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)\n- [How to Write a PostgreSQL Function with Optional Parameters: Fixing Unexpected Results When Parameters Are Omitted](https://www.codegenes.net/blog/how-to-write-function-for-optional-parameters-in-postgresql/)","timestamp":90765}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Supabase","lang":"SQL","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769682648048,"end":1769682738813,"firstResponse":90765,"sessionCreation":1,"total":90765},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

'You: ' : 'AI: '}\n          {m.parts.map((part, index) => {\n            // Render text\n            if (part.type === 'text') {\n              return <span key={`${m.id}-text-${index}`}>{part.text}</span>;\n            }\n            // Render images\n            if (part.type === 'file' && part.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')) {\n              return (\n                <Image\n                  key={`${m.id}-image-${index}`}\n                  src={part.url}\n                  width={500}\n                  height={500}\n                  alt={`attachment-${index}`}\n                />\n              );\n            }\n            // Render PDFs\n            if (part.type === 'file' && part.mediaType === 'application/pdf') {\n              return (\n                <iframe\n                  key={`${m.id}-pdf-${index}`}\n                  src={part.url}\n                  width={500}\n                  height={600}\n                  title={`pdf-${index}`}\n                />\n              );\n            }\n            return null;\n          })}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n\n      {/* Form with file upload */}\n      <form\n        onSubmit={async event => {\n          event.preventDefault();\n\n          // Convert selected files to data URLs\n          const fileParts =\n            files && files.length > 0\n              ? await convertFilesToDataURLs(files)\n              : [];\n\n          // Send message with text and files\n          sendMessage({\n            role: 'user',\n            parts: [{ type: 'text', text: input }, ...fileParts],\n          });\n\n          // Reset form\n          setInput('');\n          setFiles(undefined);\n          if (fileInputRef.current) {\n            fileInputRef.current.value = '';\n          }\n        }}\n      >\n        <input\n          type=\"file\"\n          accept=\"image/*,application/pdf\"\n          onChange={event => {\n            if (event.target.files) {\n              setFiles(event.target.files);\n            }\n          }}\n          multiple\n          ref={fileInputRef}\n        />\n        <input\n          value={input}\n          placeholder=\"Ask about the image...\"\n          onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative: Using Messages Array Directly\n\nYou can also pass images in the messages array using the URL format:\n\n```typescript\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: 'user',\n      content: [\n        { type: 'text', text: 'What is in this image?' },\n        { \n          type: 'image', \n          image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' // URL or data URL\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n### Provider Support\n\nDifferent providers have different multimodal capabilities. Switch providers by changing one line:\n\n```typescript\n// OpenAI\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n  messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n});\n\n// Anthropic\nimport { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-20250514'),\n  messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n});\n\n// Google\nimport { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash'),\n  messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n});\n```\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Parts-based structure**: Messages contain a `parts` array with text, images, PDFs, and other content\n- **Data URL support**: Files are converted to base64 data URLs for transmission\n- **Streaming**: Responses stream in real-time using `toUIMessageStreamResponse()`\n- **Provider agnostic**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers\n- **Multiple files**: Support for multiple attachments in a single message\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Use `convertToModelMessages()` to transform UI messages to the format expected by the model\n- Files must be converted to data URLs (base64) before sending\n- Different providers have varying file size limits and capabilities\n- The `useChat` hook automatically handles streaming and state management\n\nSources:\n- [Vercel AI SDK Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-sdk)\n- [Multi-Modal Agent Guide](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/guides/multi-modal-chatbot)\n- [Text Generation Documentation](https://deepwiki.com/vercel/ai/2.1-text-generation)\n- [Real-time AI Streaming with Vercel SDK](https://blog.logrocket.com/nextjs-vercel-ai-sdk-streaming/)","timestamp":83428}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Vercel AI SDK multimodal","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769682747562,"end":1769682830990,"firstResponse":83428,"sessionCreation":1,"total":83428},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"Based on the comprehensive documentation I've gathered, I can now provide you with a detailed answer about handling Clerk webhook events for organizations in 2026.\n\n---\n\n## How to Handle Clerk Webhook Events for Organizations in 2026\n\nBased on current Clerk documentation and best practices, here's a comprehensive guide to handling `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` webhook events:\n\n### 1. Setup Webhook Endpoint\n\nFirst, create a webhook endpoint in the Clerk Dashboard:\n\n1. Navigate to the [Webhooks page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/webhooks)\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`)\n4. Subscribe to organization events:\n   - `organization.created`\n   - `organization.updated`\n   - `organization.deleted`\n5. Copy your **Signing Secret** for verification\n\n### 2. Add Signing Secret to Environment Variables\n\nStore your signing secret securely in `.env`:\n\n```bash\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx\n```\n\n### 3. Create the Webhook Handler\n\n**Next.js App Router** (app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts):\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\nimport { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma' // or your DB client\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    // Verify the webhook using Clerk's helper\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n    \n    // Handle organization.created event\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.created') {\n      const { id, name, slug, created_at, image_url, public_metadata, private_metadata } = evt.data\n      \n      await prisma.organization.upsert({\n        where: { clerkId: id },\n        update: {}, // No update on create - handles duplicate webhooks\n        create: {\n          clerkId: id,\n          name: name,\n          slug: slug,\n          imageUrl: image_url,\n          publicMetadata: public_metadata,\n          createdAt: new Date(created_at),\n        },\n      })\n      \n      console.log(`Organization created: ${id}`)\n    }\n    \n    // Handle organization.updated event\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.updated') {\n      const { id, name, slug, image_url, public_metadata, updated_at } = evt.data\n      \n      await prisma.organization.upsert({\n        where: { clerkId: id },\n        update: {\n          name: name,\n          slug: slug,\n          imageUrl: image_url,\n          publicMetadata: public_metadata,\n          updatedAt: new Date(updated_at),\n        },\n        create: {\n          clerkId: id,\n          name: name,\n          slug: slug,\n          imageUrl: image_url,\n          publicMetadata: public_metadata,\n          createdAt: new Date(updated_at),\n        },\n      })\n      \n      console.log(`Organization updated: ${id}`)\n    }\n    \n    // Handle organization.deleted event\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.deleted') {\n      const { id } = evt.data\n      \n      if (id) {\n        // Option 1: Hard delete\n        await prisma.organization.delete({\n          where: { clerkId: id }\n        }).catch(() => {}) // Ignore if already deleted\n        \n        // Option 2: Soft delete (recommended for data retention)\n        // await prisma.organization.update({\n        //   where: { clerkId: id },\n        //   data: { deletedAt: new Date() }\n        // })\n        \n        console.log(`Organization deleted: ${id}`)\n      }\n    }\n    \n    return new Response('Webhook processed', { status: 200 })\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Webhook verification failed:', err)\n    return new Response('Invalid webhook', { status: 400 })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Database Schema (Prisma Example)\n\n```prisma\nmodel Organization {\n  id             Int      @id @default(autoincrement())\n  clerkId        String   @unique  // Clerk organization ID\n  name           String\n  slug           String   @unique\n  imageUrl       String?\n  publicMetadata Json?\n  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())\n  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt\n  deletedAt      DateTime? // For soft deletes\n  \n  // Relations\n  members        OrganizationMembership[]\n  \n  @@index([clerkId])\n  @@index([slug])\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Express.js Implementation\n\nFor Express/Node.js applications:\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/backend/webhooks'\nimport express, { Request, Response } from 'express'\nimport { WebhookEvent } from '@clerk/backend'\n\nconst app = express()\n\n// Use raw body parser ONLY for webhook route\napp.post(\n  '/api/webhooks/clerk',\n  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }),\n  async (req: Request, res: Response) => {\n    try {\n      const evt: WebhookEvent = verifyWebhook(req)\n      \n      switch (evt.type) {\n        case 'organization.created':\n          await db.organizations.create({\n            data: {\n              clerkId: evt.data.id,\n              name: evt.data.name,\n              slug: evt.data.slug,\n              imageUrl: evt.data.image_url,\n            }\n          })\n          break\n          \n        case 'organization.updated':\n          await db.organizations.update({\n            where: { clerkId: evt.data.id },\n            data: {\n              name: evt.data.name,\n              slug: evt.data.slug,\n              imageUrl: evt.data.image_url,\n            }\n          })\n          break\n          \n        case 'organization.deleted':\n          await db.organizations.delete({\n            where: { clerkId: evt.data.id }\n          })\n          break\n      }\n      \n      res.json({ success: true })\n    } catch (err: any) {\n      console.error('Webhook verification failed:', err.message)\n      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' })\n    }\n  }\n)\n\n// Apply JSON parsing AFTER webhook route\napp.use(express.json())\n```\n\n### 6. Key Best Practices for 2026\n\n**Security:**\n- Always use `verifyWebhook()` to validate webhook signatures\n- Never skip signature verification in production\n- Store signing secrets in environment variables\n- Make webhook routes public (they don't have auth headers)\n\n**Reliability:**\n- Use **upsert** operations for idempotency (webhooks can be delivered multiple times)\n- Return HTTP 200 for success, 400 for verification failures\n- Respond within 15 seconds to avoid Svix retries\n- Log webhook IDs (`svix-id` header) to track duplicate deliveries\n\n**Data Handling:**\n- Sync only the data you need from organization objects\n- Use database indexes on `clerkId` for fast lookups\n- Consider eventual consistency - webhooks are asynchronous\n- Handle the case where webhooks arrive out of order\n\n### 7. Advanced: Queue-Based Processing\n\nFor high-reliability production systems:\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\nimport { webhookQueue } from '@/lib/queue'\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n    const svixId = req.headers.get('svix-id')\n    \n    // Queue for async processing\n    await webhookQueue.add('clerk-event', {\n      eventType: evt.type,\n      data: evt.data,\n      svixId: svixId,\n    }, {\n      attempts: 3,\n      backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 2000 }\n    })\n    \n    return new Response('Queued', { status: 200 })\n  } catch (err) {\n    return new Response('Invalid webhook', { status: 400 })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Local Development with ngrok\n\nTest webhooks locally:\n\n1. Install ngrok and create a static domain\n2. Run: `ngrok http --url=your-domain.ngrok-free.app 3000`\n3. In Clerk Dashboard, use `https://your-domain.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/clerk`\n4. Test by creating/updating/deleting organizations in Clerk Dashboard\n\n### 9. Monitoring and Debugging\n\nAdd logging and metrics:\n\n```typescript\nlogger.info('Processing webhook', {\n  webhookId: svixId,\n  eventType: evt.type,\n  organizationId: evt.data.id,\n  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n})\n\nmetrics.increment(`webhook.${evt.type.replace('.', '_')}`)\n```\n\nView webhook delivery logs in the Clerk Dashboard under **Webhooks > [Your Endpoint] > Message Attempts**.\n\n---\n\n## Sources:\n\n- [How to sync Clerk user data to your database](https://clerk.com/articles/how-to-sync-clerk-user-data-to-your-database)\n- [Clerk Webhooks overview - Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks/overview)\n- [Sync Clerk data to your app with webhooks](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks/syncing)\n- [Handling Clerk webhook events - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/clerk-webhook-events)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about handling Clerk webhook events for organization events in 2026.","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015ACLuvh7kwfpkyzg8s97rE","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information about Clerk webhook events and organization-specific webhooks.","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01StBHbQVzrVfurSBkVeJ62F","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011Utg7wmB78u9DvyENNtqML","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the official Clerk webhook documentation to get the most current information about organization events.","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FsXmjHfZQ8vAq3W9dMWyen","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search specifically for organization webhook events documentation.","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01APvnqKXVZ4JGw33xNMAqj9","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get the Inngest documentation which might have organization webhook examples.","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VeNCn4phdui3W42ge8NPzs","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for the specific Clerk webhook events reference to find organization events.","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019U6ov4EvdJSUm9LftZez4U","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for Clerk reference documentation for webhook events types.","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RoaWLESZykzQWUtZCvgQ4t","status":"completed","timestamp":72995},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the comprehensive documentation I've gathered, I can now provide you with a detailed answer about handling Clerk webhook events for organizations in 2026.\n\n---\n\n## How to Handle Clerk Webhook Events for Organizations in 2026\n\nBased on current Clerk documentation and best practices, here's a comprehensive guide to handling `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` webhook events:\n\n### 1.

Key Best Practices for 2026\n\n**Security:**\n- Always use `verifyWebhook()` to validate webhook signatures\n- Never skip signature verification in production\n- Store signing secrets in environment variables\n- Make webhook routes public (they don't have auth headers)\n\n**Reliability:**\n- Use **upsert** operations for idempotency (webhooks can be delivered multiple times)\n- Return HTTP 200 for success, 400 for verification failures\n- Respond within 15 seconds to avoid Svix retries\n- Log webhook IDs (`svix-id` header) to track duplicate deliveries\n\n**Data Handling:**\n- Sync only the data you need from organization objects\n- Use database indexes on `clerkId` for fast lookups\n- Consider eventual consistency - webhooks are asynchronous\n- Handle the case where webhooks arrive out of order\n\n### 7. Advanced: Queue-Based Processing\n\nFor high-reliability production systems:\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\nimport { webhookQueue } from '@/lib/queue'\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n    const svixId = req.headers.get('svix-id')\n    \n    // Queue for async processing\n    await webhookQueue.add('clerk-event', {\n      eventType: evt.type,\n      data: evt.data,\n      svixId: svixId,\n    }, {\n      attempts: 3,\n      backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 2000 }\n    })\n    \n    return new Response('Queued', { status: 200 })\n  } catch (err) {\n    return new Response('Invalid webhook', { status: 400 })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Local Development with ngrok\n\nTest webhooks locally:\n\n1. Install ngrok and create a static domain\n2. Run: `ngrok http --url=your-domain.ngrok-free.app 3000`\n3. In Clerk Dashboard, use `https://your-domain.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/clerk`\n4. Test by creating/updating/deleting organizations in Clerk Dashboard\n\n### 9. Monitoring and Debugging\n\nAdd logging and metrics:\n\n```typescript\nlogger.info('Processing webhook', {\n  webhookId: svixId,\n  eventType: evt.type,\n  organizationId: evt.data.id,\n  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n})\n\nmetrics.increment(`webhook.${evt.type.replace('.', '_')}`)\n```\n\nView webhook delivery logs in the Clerk Dashboard under **Webhooks > [Your Endpoint] > Message Attempts**.\n\n---\n\n## Sources:\n\n- [How to sync Clerk user data to your database](https://clerk.com/articles/how-to-sync-clerk-user-data-to-your-database)\n- [Clerk Webhooks overview - Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks/overview)\n- [Sync Clerk data to your app with webhooks](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks/syncing)\n- [Handling Clerk webhook events - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/clerk-webhook-events)","timestamp":72995}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Clerk","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769683339505,"end":1769683412500,"firstResponse":72995,"sessionCreation":0,"total":72995},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

For i18n (internationalization) in Kotlin Multiplatform projects, KSP enables automated generation of type-safe resource accessors and localization code.\n\n### Why Use KSP for i18n?\n\n1. **Performance**: Up to **2x faster** than KAPT-based processors\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: 30-50% less memory consumption\n3. **Kotlin-Native**: Direct integration with Kotlin compiler (no Java stub generation)\n4. **Multiplatform Support**: Works with KMP targets (JVM, JS, Native)\n5. **Incremental Compilation**: Only reprocesses changed symbols\n\n### Current State in 2026\n\nPopular i18n libraries for KMP are transitioning to or already support KSP:\n\n- **Moko Resources**: Widely used for KMP i18n (as shown in the Thomas Kioko example)\n- **Custom KSP Processors**: Teams are building tailored solutions for their needs\n- **Lyricist**: KMP string localization library\n- **KMP Resources**: Alternative resource management solutions\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n#### 1. **Basic Setup**\n\nAdd KSP plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`:\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\") version \"2.0.20-1.0.25\" // Match your Kotlin version\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    // Your i18n library with KSP support\n    commonMainImplementation(\"dev.icerock.moko:resources:0.23.0\")\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"dev.icerock.moko:resources-generator:0.23.0\")\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. **Create Annotation-Based System**\n\nDefine annotations for i18n resources:\n\n```kotlin\n@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)\nannotation class LocalizedStrings\n\n@Target(AnnotationTarget.PROPERTY)\nannotation class StringResource(val key: String)\n```\n\n#### 3. **Implement KSP Processor**\n\nCreate a custom processor for generating localization code:\n\n```kotlin\nclass I18nSymbolProcessor(\n    private val codeGenerator: CodeGenerator,\n    private val logger: KSPLogger\n) : SymbolProcessor {\n    \n    override fun process(resolver: Resolver): List<KSAnnotated> {\n        val symbols = resolver.getSymbolsWithAnnotation(\n            \"com.yourapp.LocalizedStrings\"\n        )\n        \n        symbols.filterIsInstance<KSClassDeclaration>().forEach { classDecl ->\n            generateLocalizationAdapter(classDecl)\n        }\n        \n        return emptyList()\n    }\n    \n    private fun generateLocalizationAdapter(classDecl: KSClassDeclaration) {\n        // Use KotlinPoet to generate code\n        val file = codeGenerator.createNewFile(\n            Dependencies(false),\n            classDecl.packageName.asString(),\n            \"${classDecl.simpleName.asString()}Generated\"\n        )\n        \n        // Generate localization accessors\n        file.bufferedWriter().use { writer ->\n            writer.write(\"\"\"\n                // Generated code for ${classDecl.simpleName.asString()}\n                object LocalizedResources {\n                    fun getString(key: String, locale: String): String {\n                        // Implementation\n                    }\n                }\n            \"\"\".trimIndent())\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass I18nProcessorProvider : SymbolProcessorProvider {\n    override fun create(environment: SymbolProcessorEnvironment): SymbolProcessor {\n        return I18nSymbolProcessor(\n            environment.codeGenerator,\n            environment.logger\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Architecture Pattern (2026 Best Practice)**\n\nFollowing the architecture from Thomas Kioko's implementation:\n\n```kotlin\n// Common module\ninterface LocaleProvider {\n    val currentLocale: Flow<String>\n    suspend fun setLocale(languageCode: String)\n    fun getSupportedLocales(): Flow<List<String>>\n}\n\n// Generated by KSP\n@LocalizedStrings\nobject AppStrings {\n    @StringResource(\"button_retry\")\n    val buttonRetry: String = \"\" // KSP generates actual implementation\n    \n    @StringResource(\"label_settings\")\n    val labelSettings: String = \"\"\n}\n\n// Usage in Presenter\nclass SettingsPresenter(\n    private val localeProvider: LocaleProvider,\n    private val localizer: Localizer\n) {\n    val state = localeProvider.currentLocale.map { locale ->\n        SettingsState(\n            retryLabel = localizer.getString(AppStrings.buttonRetry)\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. **Platform-Specific Implementations**\n\n**Android:**\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocaleProvider(private val context: Context) {\n    actual fun getPreferredLocales(): Flow<List<String>> {\n        val locales = context.resources.configuration.locales\n        return flowOf((0 until locales.size()).map { locales[it].language })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**iOS:**\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocaleProvider {\n    actual fun getPreferredLocales(): Flow<List<String>> {\n        val identifiers = NSLocale.preferredLanguages\n            .filterIsInstance<String>()\n            .mapNotNull { it.split('-', '_').firstOrNull()?.lowercase() }\n        return flowOf(identifiers)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Benefits for i18n\n\n1. **Type Safety**: Generated code ensures compile-time checking of string keys\n2. **No Runtime Reflection**: All localization logic resolved at compile time\n3. **Performance**: Faster resource lookups with generated adapters\n4. **Dynamic Language Switching**: Support for runtime language changes without app restart\n5. **Testing**: Easy to mock and test localized strings\n\n### Migration Path from KAPT/Other Solutions\n\n```kotlin\n// Before (KAPT-based)\nkapt(\"com.example:i18n-processor:1.0\")\n\n// After (KSP-based)\nksp(\"com.example:i18n-processor:2.0-ksp\")\n```\n\n### Tools and Libraries to Use\n\n1. **KotlinPoet**: For generating Kotlin source files\n2. **Moko Resources**: Mature KMP resource management\n3. **KSP API**: Core symbol processing framework\n4. **Gradle KSP Plugin**: Build integration\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Incremental Processing**: Mark your processor as `ISOLATING` for optimal caching\n2. **Separate Concerns**: Keep i18n in dedicated module for parallel builds\n3. **DataStore Integration**: Persist language preferences across app restarts\n4. **Testing Strategy**: Write tests for locale switching logic\n5. **CI/CD Optimization**: KSP reduces build times significantly in pipelines\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\n\nBased on real-world data from 2025-2026:\n- **Build Time**: 40-87% reduction compared to KAPT\n- **Memory Usage**: 30-50% lower heap consumption\n- **Incremental Builds**: 50-70% faster for unchanged modules\n\n### Conclusion\n\nKSP is the recommended approach for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform as of 2026. It provides superior performance, native Kotlin support, and excellent multiplatform compatibility. Combined with libraries like Moko Resources or custom processors using KotlinPoet, you can build robust, type-safe internationalization systems with minimal runtime overhead.\n\n---\n\n### Sources:\n- [Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform: Part 2 - Thomas Kioko](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization_part2/)\n- [Leveraging Code Generation with KSP for Efficient JSON Serialization - adjoe](https://adjoe.io/company/engineer-blog/generating-code-with-kotlin-symbol-processing/)\n- [Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP): A Comprehensive Guide - Medium](https://medium.com/@SrimanthChowdary/kotlin-symbol-processing-ksp-a-comprehensive-guide-to-modern-annotation-processing-in-kotlin-0200d4ac53e4)\n- [State of Kotlin 2026 - Dev Newsletter](https://devnewsletter.com/p/state-of-kotlin-2026)\n- [Kotlin Multiplatform: 2025 Updates and 2026 Predictions - Aetherius Solutions](https://www.aetherius-solutions.com/blog-posts/kotlin-multiplatform-in-2026)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about using KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026.","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":76959},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HmWDD896W9FzUEXtyuaowo","status":"completed","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information about KSP for i18n code generation:","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":76959},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AHWd6iM1o96Q2xQTbSssKq","status":"completed","timestamp":76959},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XH9G9VTxYJQt7Q9VLmDkYb","status":"completed","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about KSP-based i18n code generation:","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":76959},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01V56QTUmynjAxNjERE8AT7C","status":"completed","timestamp":76959},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QvmBSo4TqAqBK9LiJFw5U5","status":"completed","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":76959},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BzrrLLoVpVx6pDHxp9CMi5","status":"completed","timestamp":76959},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research using ydc-server, here's a comprehensive answer about using KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026:\n\n## How to Use KSP for i18n Code Generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026\n\n### Overview\n\n**Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)** is the modern approach for compile-time code generation in Kotlin, offering significant performance improvements over KAPT.

architecture from Thomas Kioko's implementation:\n\n```kotlin\n// Common module\ninterface LocaleProvider {\n    val currentLocale: Flow<String>\n    suspend fun setLocale(languageCode: String)\n    fun getSupportedLocales(): Flow<List<String>>\n}\n\n// Generated by KSP\n@LocalizedStrings\nobject AppStrings {\n    @StringResource(\"button_retry\")\n    val buttonRetry: String = \"\" // KSP generates actual implementation\n    \n    @StringResource(\"label_settings\")\n    val labelSettings: String = \"\"\n}\n\n// Usage in Presenter\nclass SettingsPresenter(\n    private val localeProvider: LocaleProvider,\n    private val localizer: Localizer\n) {\n    val state = localeProvider.currentLocale.map { locale ->\n        SettingsState(\n            retryLabel = localizer.getString(AppStrings.buttonRetry)\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. **Platform-Specific Implementations**\n\n**Android:**\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocaleProvider(private val context: Context) {\n    actual fun getPreferredLocales(): Flow<List<String>> {\n        val locales = context.resources.configuration.locales\n        return flowOf((0 until locales.size()).map { locales[it].language })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**iOS:**\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocaleProvider {\n    actual fun getPreferredLocales(): Flow<List<String>> {\n        val identifiers = NSLocale.preferredLanguages\n            .filterIsInstance<String>()\n            .mapNotNull { it.split('-', '_').firstOrNull()?.lowercase() }\n        return flowOf(identifiers)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Benefits for i18n\n\n1. **Type Safety**: Generated code ensures compile-time checking of string keys\n2. **No Runtime Reflection**: All localization logic resolved at compile time\n3. **Performance**: Faster resource lookups with generated adapters\n4. **Dynamic Language Switching**: Support for runtime language changes without app restart\n5. **Testing**: Easy to mock and test localized strings\n\n### Migration Path from KAPT/Other Solutions\n\n```kotlin\n// Before (KAPT-based)\nkapt(\"com.example:i18n-processor:1.0\")\n\n// After (KSP-based)\nksp(\"com.example:i18n-processor:2.0-ksp\")\n```\n\n### Tools and Libraries to Use\n\n1. **KotlinPoet**: For generating Kotlin source files\n2. **Moko Resources**: Mature KMP resource management\n3. **KSP API**: Core symbol processing framework\n4. **Gradle KSP Plugin**: Build integration\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Incremental Processing**: Mark your processor as `ISOLATING` for optimal caching\n2. **Separate Concerns**: Keep i18n in dedicated module for parallel builds\n3. **DataStore Integration**: Persist language preferences across app restarts\n4. **Testing Strategy**: Write tests for locale switching logic\n5. **CI/CD Optimization**: KSP reduces build times significantly in pipelines\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\n\nBased on real-world data from 2025-2026:\n- **Build Time**: 40-87% reduction compared to KAPT\n- **Memory Usage**: 30-50% lower heap consumption\n- **Incremental Builds**: 50-70% faster for unchanged modules\n\n### Conclusion\n\nKSP is the recommended approach for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform as of 2026. It provides superior performance, native Kotlin support, and excellent multiplatform compatibility. Combined with libraries like Moko Resources or custom processors using KotlinPoet, you can build robust, type-safe internationalization systems with minimal runtime overhead.\n\n---\n\n### Sources:\n- [Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform: Part 2 - Thomas Kioko](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization_part2/)\n- [Leveraging Code Generation with KSP for Efficient JSON Serialization - adjoe](https://adjoe.io/company/engineer-blog/generating-code-with-kotlin-symbol-processing/)\n- [Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP): A Comprehensive Guide - Medium](https://medium.com/@SrimanthChowdary/kotlin-symbol-processing-ksp-a-comprehensive-guide-to-modern-annotation-processing-in-kotlin-0200d4ac53e4)\n- [State of Kotlin 2026 - Dev Newsletter](https://devnewsletter.com/p/state-of-kotlin-2026)\n- [Kotlin Multiplatform: 2025 Updates and 2026 Predictions - Aetherius Solutions](https://www.aetherius-solutions.com/blog-posts/kotlin-multiplatform-in-2026)","timestamp":76959}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Kotlin","lang":"Kotlin","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769683460682,"end":1769683537641,"firstResponse":76959,"sessionCreation":0,"total":76959},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Here's how to do it:\n\n## How to Compute TTFB Using httpx Trace Callback and Response Headers Timing in Python\n\nThere are two main approaches to measure Time To First Byte (TTFB) with httpx:\n\n### Method 1: Using Event Hooks with Manual Timing\n\nhttpx provides event hooks that allow you to measure timing at different stages of the request lifecycle. Here's how to calculate TTFB:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\n# Dictionary to store request start times\nrequest_times = {}\n\ndef log_request(request):\n    \"\"\"Called when request is about to be sent\"\"\"\n    # Store the start time for this request\n    request_times[id(request)] = time.perf_counter()\n    print(f\"Request: {request.method} {request.url}\")\n\ndef log_response(response):\n    \"\"\"Called when first byte of response is received\"\"\"\n    request = response.request\n    request_id = id(request)\n    \n    # Calculate TTFB\n    if request_id in request_times:\n        ttfb = time.perf_counter() - request_times[request_id]\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.4f} seconds\")\n        \n        # Clean up\n        del request_times[request_id]\n    \n    # If you need the full response time including body download\n    # you must call response.read() first\n    response.read()\n    \n    # Now you can access response.elapsed\n    total_time = response.elapsed.total_seconds()\n    print(f\"Total time: {total_time:.4f} seconds\")\n    print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n\n# Create client with event hooks\nclient = httpx.Client(\n    event_hooks={\n        'request': [log_request],\n        'response': [log_response]\n    }\n)\n\n# Make request\nresponse = client.get('https://example.com')\nclient.close()\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using Context Manager and response.elapsed\n\nFor simpler timing without hooks:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\nurl = 'https://example.com'\n\n# Measure TTFB manually\nstart = time.perf_counter()\nresponse = httpx.get(url, follow_redirects=True)\nttfb = time.perf_counter() - start\n\nprint(f\"TTFB (approximate): {ttfb:.4f} seconds\")\n\n# Read the response body\ncontent = response.read()\n\n# Total time after reading body\ntotal_time = response.elapsed.total_seconds()\nprint(f\"Total elapsed time: {total_time:.4f} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Body size: {len(content)} bytes\")\n```\n\n### Method 3: Async Support with Event Hooks\n\nFor async applications, use async event hooks:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\nasync def async_log_request(request):\n    \"\"\"Async request hook\"\"\"\n    request.extensions['start_time'] = time.perf_counter()\n    print(f\"Request: {request.method} {request.url}\")\n\nasync def async_log_response(response):\n    \"\"\"Async response hook\"\"\"\n    start_time = response.request.extensions.get('start_time')\n    if start_time:\n        ttfb = time.perf_counter() - start_time\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.4f} seconds\")\n    \n    # Read response if needed\n    await response.aread()\n    print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n\nasync def main():\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient(\n        event_hooks={\n            'request': [async_log_request],\n            'response': [async_log_response]\n        }\n    ) as client:\n        response = await client.get('https://example.com')\n        return response\n\n# Run async code\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Method 4: Parsing Server-Timing Headers\n\nIf the server provides `Server-Timing` headers, you can extract backend timing information:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport re\n\ndef parse_server_timing(response):\n    \"\"\"Parse Server-Timing header for backend metrics\"\"\"\n    timing_header = response.headers.get('Server-Timing', '')\n    if not timing_header:\n        return {}\n    \n    timings = {}\n    # Server-Timing format: metric;dur=123.4;desc=\"description\"\n    for entry in timing_header.split(','):\n        parts = entry.strip().split(';')\n        if parts:\n            metric_name = parts[0].strip()\n            duration = None\n            description = None\n            \n            for part in parts[1:]:\n                if part.strip().startswith('dur='):\n                    duration = float(part.split('=')[1])\n                elif part.strip().startswith('desc='):\n                    description = part.split('=')[1].strip('\"')\n            \n            timings[metric_name] = {\n                'duration': duration,\n                'description': description\n            }\n    \n    return timings\n\n# Make request and parse timing headers\nresponse = httpx.get('https://example.com')\nserver_timings = parse_server_timing(response)\n\nprint(\"Server-Timing metrics:\", server_timings)\n```\n\n### Complete Example with All Metrics\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass TimingStats:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.request_start = None\n        self.ttfb = None\n        self.total_time = None\n        self.dns_time = None\n        self.connect_time = None\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return (f\"Request Start: {self.request_start}\\n\"\n                f\"TTFB: {self.ttfb:.4f}s\\n\"\n                f\"Total Time: {self.total_time:.4f}s\")\n\ndef create_timing_client():\n    timing_stats = {}\n    \n    def request_hook(request):\n        req_id = id(request)\n        stats = TimingStats()\n        stats.request_start = time.perf_counter()\n        timing_stats[req_id] = stats\n        print(f\"→ {request.method} {request.url}\")\n    \n    def response_hook(response):\n        req_id = id(response.request)\n        if req_id in timing_stats:\n            stats = timing_stats[req_id]\n            stats.ttfb = time.perf_counter() - stats.request_start\n            \n            # Read response to get full elapsed time\n            response.read()\n            stats.total_time = response.elapsed.total_seconds()\n            \n            print(f\"← {response.status_code} - TTFB: {stats.ttfb:.4f}s, \"\n                  f\"Total: {stats.total_time:.4f}s\")\n            \n            # Parse Server-Timing if available\n            if 'server-timing' in response.headers:\n                print(f\"  Server-Timing: {response.headers['server-timing']}\")\n    \n    client = httpx.Client(\n        event_hooks={\n            'request': [request_hook],\n            'response': [response_hook]\n        },\n        follow_redirects=True\n    )\n    \n    return client, timing_stats\n\n# Usage\nclient, stats = create_timing_client()\nresponse = client.get('https://httpbin.org/delay/1')\nclient.close()\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **Event Hooks**: The `response` hook is called when the first byte arrives, making it ideal for TTFB measurement\n2. **response.elapsed**: Only available after calling `response.read()` or when the response is closed\n3. **Async Support**: Use async functions for event hooks with `AsyncClient`\n4. **Server-Timing Header**: Provides server-side performance metrics if the server supports it\n5. **time.perf_counter()**: Use this instead of `time.time()` for accurate timing measurements\n\nSources:\n- [Event Hooks -

start_time\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.4f} seconds\")\n    \n    # Read response if needed\n    await response.aread()\n    print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n\nasync def main():\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient(\n        event_hooks={\n            'request': [async_log_request],\n            'response': [async_log_response]\n        }\n    ) as client:\n        response = await client.get('https://example.com')\n        return response\n\n# Run async code\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Method 4: Parsing Server-Timing Headers\n\nIf the server provides `Server-Timing` headers, you can extract backend timing information:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport re\n\ndef parse_server_timing(response):\n    \"\"\"Parse Server-Timing header for backend metrics\"\"\"\n    timing_header = response.headers.get('Server-Timing', '')\n    if not timing_header:\n        return {}\n    \n    timings = {}\n    # Server-Timing format: metric;dur=123.4;desc=\"description\"\n    for entry in timing_header.split(','):\n        parts = entry.strip().split(';')\n        if parts:\n            metric_name = parts[0].strip()\n            duration = None\n            description = None\n            \n            for part in parts[1:]:\n                if part.strip().startswith('dur='):\n                    duration = float(part.split('=')[1])\n                elif part.strip().startswith('desc='):\n                    description = part.split('=')[1].strip('\"')\n            \n            timings[metric_name] = {\n                'duration': duration,\n                'description': description\n            }\n    \n    return timings\n\n# Make request and parse timing headers\nresponse = httpx.get('https://example.com')\nserver_timings = parse_server_timing(response)\n\nprint(\"Server-Timing metrics:\", server_timings)\n```\n\n### Complete Example with All Metrics\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass TimingStats:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.request_start = None\n        self.ttfb = None\n        self.total_time = None\n        self.dns_time = None\n        self.connect_time = None\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return (f\"Request Start: {self.request_start}\\n\"\n                f\"TTFB: {self.ttfb:.4f}s\\n\"\n                f\"Total Time: {self.total_time:.4f}s\")\n\ndef create_timing_client():\n    timing_stats = {}\n    \n    def request_hook(request):\n        req_id = id(request)\n        stats = TimingStats()\n        stats.request_start = time.perf_counter()\n        timing_stats[req_id] = stats\n        print(f\"→ {request.method} {request.url}\")\n    \n    def response_hook(response):\n        req_id = id(response.request)\n        if req_id in timing_stats:\n            stats = timing_stats[req_id]\n            stats.ttfb = time.perf_counter() - stats.request_start\n            \n            # Read response to get full elapsed time\n            response.read()\n            stats.total_time = response.elapsed.total_seconds()\n            \n            print(f\"← {response.status_code} -

Let me compile the key findings:\n\n## Best Prompt Engineering Techniques for Bounding Box Detection in Medical Imaging Using Vertex AI in 2026\n\nBased on the latest research and developments, here are the most effective prompt engineering techniques:\n\n### 1. **Multi-Modal Prompt Strategies with Gemini Models**\n\n**Bounding Box Prompts:**\n- Use explicit coordinate-based prompts: Provide bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] as part of your prompt to guide the model's attention to specific anatomical regions\n- Conversational segmentation: Leverage Gemini 2.5's conversational capabilities to iteratively refine detection boundaries through natural language dialogue\n- Zero-shot object detection: Use descriptive prompts like \"Identify and draw bounding boxes around all lesions in this chest X-ray\" without requiring training data\n\n**Visual + Text Prompt Combinations:**\n- Combine textual descriptions with visual markers (reference images or annotated examples)\n- Use chain-of-thought prompting: \"First identify the region of interest, then describe its characteristics, then provide bounding box coordinates\"\n\n### 2. **SAM (Segment Anything Model) Integration Techniques**\n\nRecent research highlights several SAM-based approaches for medical imaging:\n\n**Prompt Types for SAM:**\n- **Point prompts**: Click specific pixels to indicate objects of interest\n- **Box prompts**: Provide rough bounding boxes that SAM refines automatically\n- **Mask prompts**: Use existing segmentation masks to guide detection\n- **Text prompts**: Natural language descriptions of anatomical structures\n\n**Medical SAM3 (2026):**\n- Universal prompt-driven architecture supporting all modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound)\n- Self-prompt mechanisms that automatically generate optimal prompts for medical structures\n- Learnable prompt strategies that adapt to specific medical imaging tasks\n\n### 3. **Vertex AI-Specific Best Practices**\n\n**Prompt Design Framework:**\n- **Context setting**: Begin prompts with medical imaging context (e.g., \"You are analyzing a chest CT scan for lung nodule detection\")\n- **Task specification**: Clearly define the detection task (e.g., \"Generate bounding boxes for all nodules larger than 3mm\")\n- **Format requirements**: Specify output format (e.g., \"Return coordinates in COCO format: [x_min, y_min, width, height]\")\n- **Confidence thresholds**: Include desired confidence levels (e.g., \"Only return detections with >90% confidence\")\n\n**Multimodal Capabilities (2026):**\n- Google Cloud enhanced Vertex AI Search for Healthcare with multimodal AI, enabling combined text-image prompts\n- MedGemma 1.5 with imaging support for specialized medical image analysis\n- Use Vertex AI Studio for no-code prompt prototyping and testing\n\n### 4. **Advanced Prompt Engineering Patterns**\n\n**Few-Shot Learning:**\n- Provide 2-4 annotated examples in your prompt showing correct bounding box placements\n- Include both positive examples (correct detections) and negative examples (what to avoid)\n\n**Chain-of-Thought for Complex Cases:**\n```\n\"Analyze this medical image step by step:\n1. Identify the anatomical region\n2. Locate any abnormalities\n3. For each abnormality, provide:\n   - Clinical description\n   - Bounding box coordinates\n   - Confidence score\"\n```\n\n**Constraint-Based Prompts:**\n- Include anatomical constraints (e.g., \"tumors should be within organ boundaries\")\n- Size constraints (e.g., \"detect objects between 5-50mm\")\n- Spatial relationships (e.g., \"lymph nodes must be adjacent to major vessels\")\n\n### 5. **Error Handling and Refinement**\n\n**Iterative Refinement Strategies:**\n- Use conversation history to refine detections: \"The previous bounding box was too large. Reduce it to only include the dense region\"\n- Multi-turn prompting for ambiguous cases\n- Request explanation: \"Explain why you placed the bounding box at these coordinates\"\n\n**Validation Prompts:**\n- Ask the model to verify: \"Review the bounding boxes and flag any that may be incorrect\"\n- Cross-check with clinical guidelines in the prompt\n\n### 6. **Performance Optimization**\n\n**Model Selection in Vertex AI:**\n- Use Gemini 2.5 Pro for complex medical imaging tasks requiring high accuracy\n- Use Gemini Flash models for faster inference on routine detection tasks\n- Consider specialized models like MedGemma for clinical-specific vocabulary\n\n**Prompt Efficiency:**\n- Keep prompts concise while maintaining specificity\n- Use structured templates for consistent results\n- Leverage Vertex AI's prompt caching for repeated similar tasks\n\n### 7. **Recent Innovations (2026)**\n\n**BREPS Framework:**\n- Bounding-Box Robustness Evaluation for Promptable Segmentation\n- Tests prompt robustness across variations in box placement\n- Use slightly perturbed bounding boxes in prompts to improve model robustness\n\n**Agentic Vision (Gemini 3 Flash):**\n- New \"agentic vision\" capabilities for autonomous image analysis\n- Model can self-correct bounding box predictions through internal reasoning\n\n### Implementation Example for Vertex AI:\n\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nTask: Medical object detection in chest X-ray\nInstructions:\n1.

{"id":"websearch-844","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","output":"Based on the official Android developer documentation I've retrieved, here are the **2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key Changes in Android 15+ (2026)\n\n### Edge-to-Edge Enforcement\n- **Android 15 (API 35) and higher**: Apps automatically draw edge-to-edge by default once they target SDK 35\n- App content now extends behind the status bar and navigation bar by default\n- This is a mandatory change for apps targeting Android 15+\n\n### Window Insets Types\n\nAndroid provides several inset types for handling navigation bar gestures:\n\n#### Navigation-Related Insets\n\n1. **`WindowInsets.navigationBars`** - Describes the system UI bars (taskbar or navigation icons) on left, right, or bottom. Changes dynamically based on user's navigation method.\n\n2. **`WindowInsets.systemGestures`** - Represents areas where the system intercepts gestures for navigation. Apps can opt out of a limited portion using `Modifier.systemGestureExclusion()`.\n\n3. **`WindowInsets.mandatorySystemGestures`** - A subset of system gestures that are **always** handled by the system and cannot be opted out via gesture exclusion. Critical for home and quick-switch gestures.\n\n4. **`WindowInsets.tappableElement`** - Provides detailed information about navigation UI, indicating areas where \"taps\" are handled by the system rather than the app. For transparent navigation bars with gesture navigation, some app elements can be tappable through the system navigation UI.\n\n#### Safe Inset Types (Recommended)\n\n- **`WindowInsets.safeDrawing`** - Prevents content from being obscured by system UI (most common usage)\n- **`WindowInsets.safeGestures`** - Prevents system gestures from conflicting with app gestures (important for bottom sheets, carousels, games)\n- **`WindowInsets.safeContent`** - Combination of both safeDrawing and safeGestures for complete protection\n\n### Gesture Navigation Guidelines\n\n#### Back Gestures\n- Inward swipe from left or right edge\n- Apps can opt out selectively using `View.setSystemGestureExclusionRects()` by passing a `List<Rect>`\n- Should only exclude areas when necessary\n\n#### Home & Quick-Switch Gestures\n- Swipes at the bottom of the screen\n- **Apps cannot opt out** of these gestures\n- Use `WindowInsets.getMandatorySystemGestureInsets()` to understand touch recognition thresholds\n\n#### Dynamic Color Adaptation\n- After targeting Android 15 or calling `enableEdgeToEdge()`, the system applies **dynamic color adaptation**\n- Navigation bar handle automatically changes color (dark on light content, light on dark content) for better visibility\n- Transparent gesture navigation bars are always recommended\n\n### Best Practices (2026)\n\n1. **Call `enableEdgeToEdge()`** in your Activity for backward compatibility with pre-Android 15 devices\n\n2. **Use transparent/translucent system bars** - Let content draw behind them\n\n3. **Apply proper insets** - Use `WindowInsets` APIs to ensure important content and touch targets aren't obscured\n\n4. **Avoid placing interactive elements** under gesture navigation insets, especially mandatory gesture areas\n\n5. **For scrolling content** - Use gradient protection or translucent navigation bars when UI scrolls underneath\n\n6. **Games and full-screen apps** - Can request immersive mode to disable system gestures during gameplay; users can re-enable by swiping from bottom\n\n### Implementation Notes\n\n- Each inset type provides four pixel dimensions: **top, left, right, bottom**\n- These specify how far system UI extends from corresponding sides of the app window\n- Documentation was last updated **January 26, 2026** (official Android Developers site)\n\nSources:\n- [About window insets | Jetpack Compose | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/system/insets)\n- [Lay out your app within window insets | Views | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/insets)\n- [Ensure compatibility with gesture navigation | Views | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/gestures/gesturenav)\n- [Android system bars | Mobile | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/foundations/system-bars)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets.","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":59114},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011GeQjkEvP3kVEhgwKzCKP2","status":"completed","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search more specifically for Android developer documentation about WindowInsets and gesture insets.","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":59114},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Tcc6q7jZb96EnvNuuwzYJa","status":"completed","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the official Android developer documentation on window insets to get the most accurate and up-to-date guidelines.","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":59114},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0121nBfiMc5TpVR45Mnam7QC","status":"completed","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about gesture navigation bar insets.","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":59114},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013q1c9NaQaX4QRgfPZbUE4x","status":"completed","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":59114},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01DFg7YMVqDdbA3X8RLZULxu","status":"completed","timestamp":59114},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the official Android developer documentation I've retrieved, here are the **2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key Changes in Android 15+ (2026)\n\n### Edge-to-Edge Enforcement\n- **Android 15 (API 35) and higher**: Apps automatically draw edge-to-edge by default once they target SDK 35\n- App content now extends behind the status bar and navigation bar by default\n- This is a mandatory change for apps targeting Android 15+\n\n### Window Insets Types\n\nAndroid provides several inset types for handling navigation bar gestures:\n\n#### Navigation-Related Insets\n\n1. **`WindowInsets.navigationBars`** - Describes the system UI bars (taskbar or navigation icons) on left, right, or bottom.

gathered, here are the latest trends in AI agent coordination and hierarchical team management for 2025-2026:\n\n## Key Trends in AI Agent Coordination and Hierarchical Management\n\n### 1. **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Architectures**\nThe most significant trend is the emergence of hierarchical agent systems with distinct roles:\n- **Manager Agents**: Coordinate tasks and delegate to specialist agents\n- **Specialist Agents**: Handle domain-specific tasks with expertise\n- **Worker Agents**: Execute low-level operations and data processing\n\nThis mirrors traditional organizational structures but with AI agents at each level.\n\n### 2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns**\nEnterprise-grade orchestration is becoming standardized with several architectural patterns:\n- **Sequential coordination**: Agents work in pipeline fashion\n- **Parallel processing**: Multiple agents tackle independent tasks simultaneously\n- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining sequential and parallel patterns based on task requirements\n\n### 3. **Agentic AI Enterprise Adoption**\nOrganizations are moving from single chatbots to \"agentic enterprises\" where:\n- AI agents manage themselves with minimal human oversight\n- Agents coordinate across departments and functions\n- Enterprise systems integrate multiple specialized agents\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Coordination Mechanisms**\nNew coordination capabilities include:\n- **Inter-agent communication protocols**: Standardized ways for agents to share information\n- **Dynamic task allocation**: Agents self-organize based on capabilities and workload\n- **Conflict resolution**: Automated handling of competing priorities or resource conflicts\n\n### 5. **Team-Based AI Models**\nRather than individual agents, the focus is shifting to:\n- Pre-configured agent teams for specific use cases\n- Persistent team memory and shared context\n- Collaborative problem-solving with complementary agent skills\n\n### 6. **ROI and Performance Benchmarking**\nOrganizations are developing:\n- Metrics for measuring multi-agent system effectiveness\n- Benchmarks comparing different orchestration approaches\n- Cost-benefit analysis frameworks for agent coordination complexity\n\n### 7. **Autonomous Management Capabilities**\nThe \"machines that manage themselves\" concept includes:\n- Self-healing agent systems\n- Automated scaling and resource allocation\n- Continuous learning from team interactions\n\nThese trends indicate a maturation of AI agent technology from individual assistants to sophisticated, coordinated teams capable of handling complex enterprise workflows with minimal human intervention.\n\nSources:\n- [7 Agentic AI Trends to Watch in 2026 -

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","output":"Based on the latest information from 2025-2026, here's how to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object:\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n**Human-in-the-loop workflows** in LangGraph allow you to pause graph execution, collect human input, and resume processing. The key components are:\n\n1. **`interrupt()` function** - Pauses execution and waits for human input\n2. **`Command` object** - Used to resume execution and optionally control routing\n3. **Checkpointer** - Required for persistence (e.g., `InMemorySaver`)\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### 1. Setup and State Definition\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    user_feedback: str\n\n# Checkpointer is REQUIRED for interrupts to work\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\n```\n\n### 2. Create a Node with `interrupt()`\n\n```python\ndef human_feedback(state):\n    print(\"---Waiting for human feedback---\")\n    \n    # Pause execution and wait for input\n    feedback = interrupt(\"Please provide feedback:\")\n    \n    return {\"user_feedback\": feedback}\n```\n\n### 3. Build and Compile the Graph\n\n```python\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"step_1\", step_1)\nbuilder.add_node(\"human_feedback\", human_feedback)\nbuilder.add_node(\"step_3\", step_3)\n\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_1\", \"human_feedback\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"human_feedback\", \"step_3\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_3\", END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n```\n\n### 4.

The key components are:\n\n1. **`interrupt()` function** - Pauses execution and waits for human input\n2. **`Command` object** - Used to resume execution and optionally control routing\n3. **Checkpointer** - Required for persistence (e.g., `InMemorySaver`)\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### 1. Setup and State Definition\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    user_feedback: str\n\n# Checkpointer is REQUIRED for interrupts to work\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\n```\n\n### 2. Create a Node with `interrupt()`\n\n```python\ndef human_feedback(state):\n    print(\"---Waiting for human feedback---\")\n    \n    # Pause execution and wait for input\n    feedback = interrupt(\"Please provide feedback:\")\n    \n    return {\"user_feedback\": feedback}\n```\n\n### 3. Build and Compile the Graph\n\n```python\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"step_1\", step_1)\nbuilder.add_node(\"human_feedback\", human_feedback)\nbuilder.add_node(\"step_3\", step_3)\n\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"step_1\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_1\", \"human_feedback\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"human_feedback\", \"step_3\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"step_3\", END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n```\n\n### 4. Run Until Interrupt\n\n```python\ninitial_input = {\"input\": \"hello world\"}\nthread = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n\n# Run until hitting the interrupt\nfor event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode=\"updates\"):\n    print(event)\n\n# Output shows: {'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='Please provide feedback:', ...),)}\n```\n\n### 5. Resume with `Command(resume=...)`\n\n```python\n# Resume with human input\nfor event in graph.stream(\n    Command(resume=\"go to step 3!\"),\n    thread,\n    stream_mode=\"updates\"\n):\n    print(event)\n\n# Check final state\nfinal_state = graph.get_state(thread).values\n# {'input': 'hello world', 'user_feedback': 'go to step 3!'}\n```\n\n## Advanced Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Approve or Reject with Dynamic Routing\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Literal\n\ndef human_approval(state) -> Command[Literal[\"approved_path\", \"rejected_path\"]]:\n    # Pause and ask for approval\n    decision = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"Do you approve the following output?\",\n        \"llm_output\": state[\"llm_output\"]\n    })\n    \n    # Route based on decision using Command(goto=...)\n    if decision == \"approve\":\n        return Command(goto=\"approved_path\", update={\"decision\": \"approved\"})\n    else:\n        return Command(goto=\"rejected_path\", update={\"decision\": \"rejected\"})\n```\n\n**Resume:**\n```python\n# Approve\nresult = graph.invoke(Command(resume=\"approve\"), config=config)\n\n# Or reject\nresult = graph.invoke(Command(resume=\"reject\"), config=config)\n```\n\n### Pattern 2: Review and Edit State\n\n```python\ndef human_review_edit(state):\n    # Pause and show generated content\n    result = interrupt({\n        \"task\": \"Please review and edit the generated summary.\",\n        \"generated_summary\": state[\"summary\"]\n    })\n    \n    # Update state with edited version\n    return {\"summary\": result[\"edited_summary\"]}\n```\n\n**Resume with structured data:**\n```python\nedited_summary = \"The cat lay on the rug, gazing at the stars.\"\nresult = graph.invoke(\n    Command(resume={\"edited_summary\": edited_summary}),\n    config=config\n)\n```\n\n### Pattern 3: Review Tool Calls (Most Critical)\n\n```python\ndef book_hotel(hotel_name: str):\n    \"\"\"Book a hotel -

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Based on the comprehensive articles I found, here's how to fix PyTorch model loading deadlocks when using multiprocessing in 2026:\n\n## Root Causes and Solutions\n\n### 1. **Use `spawn` start method instead of `fork` (Most Critical)**\n\nThe primary cause of deadlocks with CUDA and multiprocessing is forking after CUDA has been initialized. When you `fork` a process, it copies the CUDA context into child processes, which causes corruption and deadlocks.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    # Your code here\n```\n\nAlways use `spawn` when CUDA is involved, even indirectly. This starts processes cleanly without copying the CUDA context.\n\n### 2. **Initialize CUDA inside worker processes, not in parent**\n\nDon't create CUDA tensors or call any `torch.cuda.*` functions before spawning child processes.\n\n**Bad:**\n```python\n# Don't do this\ntorch.cuda.is_available()  # CUDA initialized in parent\nmp.spawn(train_worker, ...)  # Children inherit corrupted context\n```\n\n**Good:**\n```python\ndef train_worker(rank, world_size):\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)  # Initialize inside worker\n    model = Model().cuda(rank)\n    # Training code...\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    mp.spawn(train_worker, nprocs=world_size)\n```\n\n### 3. **Don't pass CUDA tensors across process boundaries**\n\nCUDA tensors cannot be safely shared between processes. Move tensors to CPU before passing them through queues or multiprocessing primitives.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\n# In worker\nresult = model(x)\nqueue.put(result.cpu())  # Move to CPU first\n\n# In main process\nresult = queue.get()\nresult = result.cuda()  # Move back to GPU\n```\n\n### 4. **Guard entry points with `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`**\n\nOn Windows and macOS (and with `spawn` on Linux), failing to guard your main code causes recursive process spawning.\n\n**Always do this:**\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    main()\n```\n\n### 5. **Avoid file handles and unpicklable objects in parent**\n\nDon't open files, create database connections, or initialize thread locks before spawning. These objects often can't be pickled and can cause deadlocks.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\n# Open files inside the worker function, not in parent\ndef worker(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:  # Open here\n        data = f.read()\n```\n\n### 6. **Set proper timeouts and use persistent workers**\n\nFor `DataLoader`, set timeouts to surface deadlocks instead of hanging forever:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\nloader = DataLoader(\n    dataset,\n    batch_size=128,\n    num_workers=8,\n    pin_memory=True,\n    persistent_workers=True,  # Reduces startup overhead\n    timeout=60  # Fail after 60 seconds instead of hanging\n)\n```\n\n### 7. **Use proper lifecycle management**\n\nAlways join processes and close queues to avoid resource leaks that can cause deadlocks:\n\n```python\nworkers = [mp.Process(target=worker, args=(...)) for _ in range(4)]\nfor w in workers:\n    w.start()\n\n# Do work...\n\nfor w in workers:\n    w.join()  # Always join!\n```\n\n## Complete Safe Example (2026 Best Practices)\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\nimport torch.distributed as dist\nimport os\n\ndef setup(rank, world_size):\n    os.environ[\"MASTER_ADDR\"] = \"127.0.0.1\"\n    os.environ[\"MASTER_PORT\"] = \"29500\"\n    dist.init_process_group(\"nccl\", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)\n\ndef cleanup():\n    dist.destroy_process_group()\n\ndef train_worker(rank, world_size):\n    setup(rank, world_size)\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)  # Initialize CUDA here, not in parent\n    \n    model = YourModel().cuda(rank)\n    model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])\n    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n    \n    # Your training loop\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        for batch in dataloader:\n            x, y = batch\n            x, y = x.cuda(rank), y.cuda(rank)\n            # Training step...\n    \n    cleanup()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)  # Critical!\n    world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()\n    mp.spawn(train_worker, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size, join=True)\n```\n\n## Quick Debugging Checklist\n\nIf you're still experiencing deadlocks:\n\n1. ✅ Set start method to `spawn` explicitly\n2. ✅ Guard code with `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`\n3. ✅ Initialize CUDA only inside worker functions\n4. ✅ Don't pass CUDA tensors between processes\n5. ✅ Close all file handles before spawning\n6. ✅ Add timeouts to DataLoader\n7. ✅ Always join() worker processes\n8. ✅ Reduce to single worker (`num_workers=0`) to verify it's a multiprocessing issue\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Multiprocessing in Python and PyTorch: A Practical, Modern Guide – TheLinuxCode](https://thelinuxcode.com/multiprocessing-in-python-and-pytorch-a-practical-modern-guide/)\n- [Multiprocessing in Python and PyTorch: Faster Training, Safer Pipelines, Real‑World Patterns – TheLinuxCode](https://thelinuxcode.com/multiprocessing-in-python-and-pytorch-faster-training-safer-pipelines-realworld-patterns/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about fixing PyTorch model loading deadlocks with multiprocessing in 2026.","timestamp":56141},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":56141},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0155w3snLCVm5PcwVWrRqaBX","status":"completed","timestamp":56141},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific content from the most relevant sources:","timestamp":56141},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":56141},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":56141},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01M1c9uLdD1ZyWWkgaqAPQNs","status":"completed","timestamp":56141},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RDGEktTfJmaFwWFfuCaV6c","status":"completed","timestamp":56141},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the comprehensive articles I found, here's how to fix PyTorch model loading deadlocks when using multiprocessing in 2026:\n\n## Root Causes and Solutions\n\n### 1. **Use `spawn` start method instead of `fork` (Most Critical)**\n\nThe primary cause of deadlocks with CUDA and multiprocessing is forking after CUDA has been initialized.

{"id":"websearch-990","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?","output":"Based on the search results and the content I've retrieved, I can provide you with a comprehensive answer about the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025.\n\n## Latest Data Selection Techniques for LLM Reasoning with RL (2024-2025)\n\n### 1. **Curriculum Learning from Easy to Hard**\n\nOne of the most significant advances is **curriculum-based data selection**, where training progresses from easier to harder tasks:\n\n- **Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (Curriculum RL)**: This approach structures training data by difficulty level, starting with simpler reasoning tasks and gradually increasing complexity. Research from 2025 shows this improves reasoning capabilities more effectively than training on uniformly difficult tasks.\n\n- The key insight is that RL alone on inherently difficult tasks is less effective, so curriculum learning provides a structured progression path.\n\n### 2. **Hard Sample Mining and Selection**\n\nMultiple 2025 papers focus on selecting challenging examples:\n\n- **\"Hard Examples Are All You Need\"**: Research shows that maximizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) performance under computational constraints is best achieved by focusing on hard examples rather than uniform sampling.\n\n- This technique prioritizes data points where the model struggles, making training more efficient and improving reasoning on difficult problems.\n\n### 3. **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**\n\nGRPO has emerged as a key algorithm for data selection in 2024-2025:\n\n- Used prominently in **DeepSeek-R1** and other reasoning models\n- Involves sampling multiple responses for the same prompt and using relative rankings to create preference pairs\n- More sample-efficient than traditional PPO for reasoning tasks\n- Enables better selection of training trajectories based on relative quality\n\n### 4. **Semantic and Token Entropy-Based Selection**\n\nRecent 2025 work introduces entropy-based metrics for data selection:\n\n- **Semantic entropy**: Measures uncertainty at the meaning level\n- **Token entropy**: Captures uncertainty in token predictions\n- These metrics help identify which training examples provide the most learning signal for the model\n\n### 5. **Self-Evolving Curriculum**\n\nAdvanced systems now dynamically adjust their training data:\n\n- Models assess their own performance and automatically select appropriate difficulty levels\n- Creates adaptive curricula that evolve based on the model's current capabilities\n- Reduces manual intervention in curriculum design\n\n### 6. **Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data**\n\nA 2025 innovation involves revisiting pre-training data with RL:\n\n- Applies RL techniques to curated subsets of pre-training data\n- Helps bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning\n- Enables more efficient use of existing high-quality data\n\n### 7. **Preference Data Selection for RLHF**\n\nTechniques for selecting high-quality preference pairs:\n\n- **Quality filtering**: Removing low-quality or ambiguous preference pairs\n- **Diversity sampling**: Ensuring preference data covers a wide range of reasoning scenarios\n- **Disagreement-based selection**: Focusing on cases where different models or annotators disagree\n\n### 8. **DeepSeek-R1 Approach**\n\nThe DeepSeek-R1 model (released January 2025) demonstrated a multi-stage data selection strategy:\n\n1. Start with supervised fine-tuning on reasoning traces\n2. Apply RL (specifically GRPO) without explicit rewards\n3. Use self-generated reasoning chains for training\n4. Focus on mathematical and coding tasks with verifiable answers\n\n### 9. **RhymeRL - History-Based Acceleration**\n\nA 2025 technique that accelerates RL by leveraging training history:\n\n- Uses past training trajectories to guide future data selection\n- \"History rhymes\" - similar problems benefit from similar training strategies\n- Reduces redundant exploration in the data space\n\n### 10. **Adaptive Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization (G2RPO-A)**\n\nAn evolution of GRPO with adaptive data selection:\n\n- Dynamically adjusts which groups of responses to compare\n- Uses adaptive mechanisms to focus on informative comparisons\n- Improves sample efficiency in reasoning tasks\n\n## Key Trends\n\nThe field has shifted from uniform random sampling toward:\n- **Difficulty-aware selection** (curriculum learning)\n- **Quality-focused filtering** (hard examples, high-entropy samples)\n- **Adaptive methods** (self-evolving curricula)\n- **Efficiency optimization** (focusing computational resources on informative examples)\n\nThese techniques are particularly important as reasoning models require extensive compute, and smart data selection can reduce training costs while improving performance.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Curriculum Reinforcement Learning from Easy to Hard Tasks Improves LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06632)\n- [DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning

on the search results and the content I've retrieved, I can provide you with a comprehensive answer about the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025.\n\n## Latest Data Selection Techniques for LLM Reasoning with RL (2024-2025)\n\n### 1. **Curriculum Learning from Easy to Hard**\n\nOne of the most significant advances is **curriculum-based data selection**, where training progresses from easier to harder tasks:\n\n- **Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (Curriculum RL)**: This approach structures training data by difficulty level, starting with simpler reasoning tasks and gradually increasing complexity. Research from 2025 shows this improves reasoning capabilities more effectively than training on uniformly difficult tasks.\n\n- The key insight is that RL alone on inherently difficult tasks is less effective, so curriculum learning provides a structured progression path.\n\n### 2. **Hard Sample Mining and Selection**\n\nMultiple 2025 papers focus on selecting challenging examples:\n\n- **\"Hard Examples Are All You Need\"**: Research shows that maximizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) performance under computational constraints is best achieved by focusing on hard examples rather than uniform sampling.\n\n- This technique prioritizes data points where the model struggles, making training more efficient and improving reasoning on difficult problems.\n\n### 3. **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**\n\nGRPO has emerged as a key algorithm for data selection in 2024-2025:\n\n- Used prominently in **DeepSeek-R1** and other reasoning models\n- Involves sampling multiple responses for the same prompt and using relative rankings to create preference pairs\n- More sample-efficient than traditional PPO for reasoning tasks\n- Enables better selection of training trajectories based on relative quality\n\n### 4. **Semantic and Token Entropy-Based Selection**\n\nRecent 2025 work introduces entropy-based metrics for data selection:\n\n- **Semantic entropy**: Measures uncertainty at the meaning level\n- **Token entropy**: Captures uncertainty in token predictions\n- These metrics help identify which training examples provide the most learning signal for the model\n\n### 5. **Self-Evolving Curriculum**\n\nAdvanced systems now dynamically adjust their training data:\n\n- Models assess their own performance and automatically select appropriate difficulty levels\n- Creates adaptive curricula that evolve based on the model's current capabilities\n- Reduces manual intervention in curriculum design\n\n### 6. **Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data**\n\nA 2025 innovation involves revisiting pre-training data with RL:\n\n- Applies RL techniques to curated subsets of pre-training data\n- Helps bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning\n- Enables more efficient use of existing high-quality data\n\n### 7. **Preference Data Selection for RLHF**\n\nTechniques for selecting high-quality preference pairs:\n\n- **Quality filtering**: Removing low-quality or ambiguous preference pairs\n- **Diversity sampling**: Ensuring preference data covers a wide range of reasoning scenarios\n- **Disagreement-based selection**: Focusing on cases where different models or annotators disagree\n\n### 8. **DeepSeek-R1 Approach**\n\nThe DeepSeek-R1 model (released January 2025) demonstrated a multi-stage data selection strategy:\n\n1. Start with supervised fine-tuning on reasoning traces\n2. Apply RL (specifically GRPO) without explicit rewards\n3. Use self-generated reasoning chains for training\n4. Focus on mathematical and coding tasks with verifiable answers\n\n### 9. **RhymeRL - History-Based Acceleration**\n\nA 2025 technique that accelerates RL by leveraging training history:\n\n- Uses past training trajectories to guide future data selection\n- \"History rhymes\" - similar problems benefit from similar training strategies\n- Reduces redundant exploration in the data space\n\n### 10. **Adaptive Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization (G2RPO-A)**\n\nAn evolution of GRPO with adaptive data selection:\n\n- Dynamically adjusts which groups of responses to compare\n- Uses adaptive mechanisms to focus on informative comparisons\n- Improves sample efficiency in reasoning tasks\n\n## Key Trends\n\nThe field has shifted from uniform random sampling toward:\n- **Difficulty-aware selection** (curriculum learning)\n- **Quality-focused filtering** (hard examples, high-entropy samples)\n- **Adaptive methods** (self-evolving curricula)\n- **Efficiency optimization** (focusing computational resources on informative examples)\n\nThese techniques are particularly important as reasoning models require extensive compute, and smart data selection can reduce training costs while improving performance.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Curriculum Reinforcement Learning from Easy to Hard Tasks Improves LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06632)\n- [DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948)\n- [Hard Examples Are All You Need: Maximizing GRPO Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.14094v4)\n- [The State of Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-state-of-llm-reasoning-model-training)\n- [Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Semantic and Token Entropy](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04359v1)\n- [Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.14970v3)\n- [Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/grpo)\n- [A Technical Survey of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.04136v1)\n- [History Rhymes: Accelerating LLM Reinforcement Learning with RhymeRL](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.18588v1)\n- [G2RPO-A: Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization with Adaptive](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.13023v1)","timestamp":91044}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"ML_Training","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769684662842,"end":1769684753886,"firstResponse":91044,"sessionCreation":0,"total":91044},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

In fact, multiple files with different names can all belong to the same package.\n\n**File Naming Rules:**\n- **Lowercase** - all lowercase letters for consistency and cross-platform compatibility\n- **Short names** - follow package naming style\n- **Underscores allowed** - for readability in multi-word names (e.g., `move_to_front.go`, `huffman_bit_writer.go`)\n- **Some advocate mixedCaps** - though this is less common and problematic on case-insensitive filesystems\n\n**Special File Name Patterns:**\n- `*_test.go` - test files (compiled only by `go test`)\n- `*_linux.go`, `*_windows.go`, `*_amd64.go` - platform/architecture-specific builds\n- Files starting with `.` or `_` are ignored by the go tool\n\n**Example Structure:**\n```\nmypackage/\n├── server.go\n├── server_test.go\n├── client.go\n├── client_test.go\n├── util_linux.go\n└── util_windows.go\n```\n\nAll files declare `package mypackage` regardless of their individual filenames.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Unlike Java where `WebServer.java` contains class `WebServer`, Go does not require file names to match struct/type names.

Install Node.js and NPM from nodejs.org\n2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/extension-update-testing-tool`\n3. Run `npm install` in the repository root\n\n**Usage:**\n1. Start the server: `npm start`\n2. Open http://localhost:8080 in Chromium/Chrome\n3. Drag your unpacked extension (folder or .zip file) onto the page\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the extension\n5. Make changes to your extension (like adding new permissions that trigger warnings)\n6. Update the `version` field in your manifest.json\n7. Drag the updated extension to the page again\n8. Go to `chrome://extensions` and click **Update** to trigger the update flow\n\n**Advanced Options:**\n- Custom port: `PORT=4000 npm start`\n- Consistent extension ID: `WRITE_KEY=1 npm start`\n\n### Method 2: Manual Packing Method\n\nIf you prefer the traditional manual approach:\n\n**Initial Packing:**\n1.

{"id":"websearch-1049","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","output":"Based on the documentation I've retrieved, here's how to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4+ using the Add to Home Screen Push API:\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or later** - Web Push is only available starting from this version\n2. **Home Screen web app** - The website must be added to the Home Screen as a web app (not just a bookmark)\n3. **Manifest file** - Must have `display` set to `standalone` or `fullscreen`\n4. **User interaction** - Permission request must be triggered by direct user action (like tapping a button)\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### 1. Create a Web App Manifest\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"App\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"id\": \"/\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"icon-192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"icon-512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLink it in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n### 2. Register a Service Worker\n\n```javascript\n// In your main JavaScript file\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Request Push Notification Permission\n\n**Important:** This must be in response to user interaction:\n\n```javascript\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  // Check if Push API is supported\n  if (!('PushManager' in window)) {\n    console.log('Push notifications not supported');\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Request notification permission\n  const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n  \n  if (permission === 'granted') {\n    // Get service worker registration\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    \n    // Subscribe to push notifications\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY)\n    });\n    \n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach to a button click\ndocument.getElementById('subscribe-btn').addEventListener('click', subscribeToPush);\n```\n\n### 4. Create Service Worker (sw.js)\n\n```javascript\n// Handle push events\nself.addEventListener('push', event => {\n  const options = {\n    body: event.data ? event.data.text() : 'New notification',\n    icon: '/icon-192.png',\n    badge: '/badge-72.png',\n    vibrate: [200, 100, 200],\n    data: {\n      dateOfArrival: Date.now(),\n      primaryKey: 1\n    }\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification('Your App Name', options)\n  );\n});\n\n// Handle notification clicks\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', event => {\n  event.notification.close();\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow('/')\n  );\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Server-Side Push Setup\n\nYou'll need to:\n\n1. Generate VAPID keys (Voluntary Application Server Identification)\n2. Store user subscriptions in your database\n3. Use the Web Push protocol to send notifications\n4.

Create a Web App Manifest\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"App\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"id\": \"/\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"icon-192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"icon-512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLink it in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n### 2. Register a Service Worker\n\n```javascript\n// In your main JavaScript file\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Request Push Notification Permission\n\n**Important:** This must be in response to user interaction:\n\n```javascript\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  // Check if Push API is supported\n  if (!('PushManager' in window)) {\n    console.log('Push notifications not supported');\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Request notification permission\n  const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n  \n  if (permission === 'granted') {\n    // Get service worker registration\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    \n    // Subscribe to push notifications\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY)\n    });\n    \n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach to a button click\ndocument.getElementById('subscribe-btn').addEventListener('click', subscribeToPush);\n```\n\n### 4. Create Service Worker (sw.js)\n\n```javascript\n// Handle push events\nself.addEventListener('push', event => {\n  const options = {\n    body: event.data ? event.data.text() : 'New notification',\n    icon: '/icon-192.png',\n    badge: '/badge-72.png',\n    vibrate: [200, 100, 200],\n    data: {\n      dateOfArrival: Date.now(),\n      primaryKey: 1\n    }\n  };\n\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification('Your App Name', options)\n  );\n});\n\n// Handle notification clicks\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', event => {\n  event.notification.close();\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow('/')\n  );\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Server-Side Push Setup\n\nYou'll need to:\n\n1. Generate VAPID keys (Voluntary Application Server Identification)\n2. Store user subscriptions in your database\n3. Use the Web Push protocol to send notifications\n4. Allow URLs from `*.push.apple.com` in your server configuration\n\n**No Apple Developer Program membership required** - it uses the Apple Push Notification service automatically.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Badging API**: Set badge counts on the app icon\n```javascript\nnavigator.setAppBadge(5);  // Set count\nnavigator.clearAppBadge(); // Clear badge\n```\n\n- **Focus Integration**: Notifications respect iOS Focus modes automatically\n- **Manifest ID**: Use the `id` field in manifest to sync Focus settings across devices\n\n## How Users Add to Home Screen\n\n1. Open your website in Safari\n2. Tap the Share button\n3. Select \"Add to Home Screen\"\n4. The app opens standalone (not in browser) when tapped\n\n## Testing Notes\n\n- Use feature detection, not browser detection\n- Test on actual iOS 16.4+ devices (beta testing available)\n- Third-party browsers can also offer \"Add to Home Screen\" with the `com.apple.developer.web-browser` entitlement\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor detailed implementation, refer to:\n- [Meet Web Push - WebKit Blog](https://webkit.org/blog/12945/meet-web-push/)\n- [WWDC22 Session: Meet Web Push](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10098/)\n\nSources:\n- [Web Push for Web Apps on iOS and iPadOS | WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/)\n- [Sending web push notifications in web apps and browsers | Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending-web-push-notifications-in-web-apps-and-browsers)","timestamp":50260}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Web_API","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769685233806,"end":1769685284066,"firstResponse":50260,"sessionCreation":0,"total":50260},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Think of it as a powerful version control system that replaces the chaos of \"file.docx\", \"file final.docx\", \"file FINAL.docx\" with organized, trackable changes.\n\n### Step 1: Installation and Setup\n\n1. **Download GitHub Desktop** from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)\n2. Install it on your computer (works on Windows and Mac)\n3. **Create a GitHub account** if you don't have one already\n4. **Sign in** to GitHub Desktop using your account credentials\n\n### Step 2: Basic Concepts for Non-Programmers\n\n- **Repository**: A project folder that tracks all your changes\n- **Commit**: A snapshot of your work at a specific point in time\n- **Branch**: A separate version where you can experiment without affecting the main work\n- **Push**: Uploading your changes to GitHub's cloud\n- **Pull**: Downloading the latest changes from the cloud\n\n### Step 3: Creating Your First Project\n\n1. Click **File** → **New Repository**\n2. Give it a name and choose where to save it on your computer\n3. Click \"Create Repository\"\n\n### Step 4: Making and Tracking Changes\n\n1. **Edit your files** using your normal programs (Word, Excel, text editors, etc.)\n2. Open GitHub Desktop - it automatically detects changes\n3. **Review changes** in the left panel\n4. **Write a commit message** describing what you changed (e.g., \"Updated budget numbers\" or \"Fixed typos in report\")\n5. Click **Commit to main**\n6. Click **Push origin** to save to the cloud\n\n### Step 5: Collaborating with Others\n\n- **Branches** let you work on different versions simultaneously\n- **Pull Requests** let you propose changes and get feedback before merging\n- **Issues** help you track tasks and discuss ideas\n\n### Why Non-Programmers Should Use GitHub Desktop\n\n- **Never lose work** - every change is tracked and recoverable\n- **Know who changed what** - complete history of all edits\n- **Work together safely** - multiple people can work without overwriting each other\n- **No command line needed** - everything is visual and clickable\n- **Works with any file type** - documents, spreadsheets, images, etc.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Commit often** with clear, descriptive messages\n2. **Push regularly** to back up your work to the cloud\n3. **Pull before starting work** to get the latest version\n4. **Use branches** for experiments or major changes\n5. **Add specific files** rather than everything at once\n\n### Common Use Cases for Non-Programmers\n\n- Managing documentation and reports\n- Tracking design file versions\n- Collaborating on writing projects\n- Organizing research materials\n- Maintaining budgets and spreadsheets\n\nThe beauty of GitHub Desktop is that it provides professional-grade version control without requiring technical expertise.

Memory leaks, CPU overload, or disk space issues\n7. **Dependency failures** - Third-party services or APIs that your backend relies on failing\n\n### Customer Endpoint-Specific Issues\n\nFor customer endpoints specifically:\n- **Expired or invalid session tokens**\n- **Unsecured or exposed endpoints** vulnerable to malicious requests\n- **Complex endpoint structures** with multiple failure points\n- **Rate limit breaches** causing system overload\n- **Invalid session management** leading to unpredictable behavior\n\n## How to Debug 500 Errors in 2026\n\n### 1. **Check Server Logs**\n- Examine server logs for error messages and stack traces\n- Look for patterns indicating the root cause\n- Use structured logging (JSON format) with fields like `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, and contextual metadata\n\n### 2. **Verify Request Syntax and Parameters**\n- Ensure the request syntax is correct\n- Validate that you're sending valid data parameters\n- Check request headers and authentication tokens\n\n### 3. **Centralized Error Handling**\nUse middleware to catch and process all errors consistently:\n\n```javascript\napp.use((err, req, res, next) => {\n  if (res.headersSent) {\n    return next(err);\n  }\n  const status = err.status || 500;\n  res.status(status).json({\n    error: {\n      message: err.message,\n      code: status,\n      details: err.details || null\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### 4. **Implement Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**\n\nModern approaches include:\n\n- **Structured logging** with correlation IDs to trace requests across distributed systems\n- **Centralized log aggregation** using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or hosted solutions\n- **Real-time monitoring and alerting** with anomaly detection (can reduce API failures by up to 60%)\n- **API observability platforms** like Treblle, Grafana, or BetterStack\n\n### 5. **Use Debugging Tools**\n\n- **Postman** - Test API requests and compare against saved examples\n- **End-to-end API management tools** - Monitor and test APIs to identify infrastructure issues\n- **Automated tests** - Deploy regression tests regularly to catch issues before production\n\n### 6. **Security Considerations**\n\nWhile debugging:\n- **Hide stack traces in production** - Avoid exposing internal implementation details\n- **Log errors internally** - Capture complete error information with stack traces for debugging without exposing to clients\n- **Disable debug mode in production** - Prevent accidental exposure of sensitive details\n- **Use generic error messages** for clients while logging detailed information server-side\n\n### 7. **Proactive Measures**\n\n- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse and system overload\n- **Monitor API performance metrics** - Track latency, error rates, and uptime\n- **Set up automated alerts** - Get notified when error thresholds are exceeded\n- **Regular health checks** - Verify endpoint availability and database connectivity\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Standardize error response format** using RFC 7807 (\"Problem Details for HTTP APIs\")\n2. **Use AI-driven monitoring tools** for anomaly detection and faster mean time to resolution\n3. **Implement continuous API testing** in CI/CD pipelines\n4. **Apply observability platforms** that provide auto-generated dashboards for errors, performance, and security\n\nBy following these debugging approaches and implementing proper error handling, logging, and monitoring strategies, you can quickly identify and resolve 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Resolving Common REST API Errors: Troubleshooting Issues with REST API -

Turborepo Monorepo\n\n### 1. **Initialize Turborepo**\n```bash\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n```\n\n### 2. **Project Structure**\nCreate a typical monorepo structure:\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/              # Next.js app\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/               # Shared UI components\n├── turbo.json\n└── package.json\n```\n\n### 3. **Set Up the UI Package**\nCreate a shared UI package for shadcn components:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/ui\ncd packages/ui\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nIn `packages/ui/package.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n

\"^0.7.0\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Configure Tailwind CSS v4 (2026 Standard)**\nIn your UI package and apps, set up Tailwind CSS:\n\n```bash\nnpm install tailwindcss@latest postcss autoprefixer\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n```\n\nConfigure `tailwind.config.js`:\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    '../../packages/ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', // Include UI package\n  ],\n  // ... rest of config\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Initialize shadcn UI**\nIn your app directory:\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nFollow the prompts to configure:\n- TypeScript: Yes\n- Style: Default or New York\n- Base color: Your choice\n- CSS variables: Yes\n\n### 6. **Configure components.json for Monorepo**\nUpdate `apps/web/components.json` to point to the shared UI package:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"style\": \"default\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.js\",\n    \"css\": \"app/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@repo/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. **Add shadcn Components**\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest add button\nnpx shadcn@latest add card\n# Add other components as needed\n```\n\n### 8. **Export from UI Package**\nCreate `packages/ui/index.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\nexport * from './components/ui/button';\nexport * from './components/ui/card';\n// Export other components\n```\n\n### 9. **Use in Your Apps**\nIn your Next.js app:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from '@repo/ui';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button>Click me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 10. **Configure tsconfig.json**\nEnsure proper TypeScript path mappings in your app's `tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@repo/ui\": [\"../../packages/ui\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Key Benefits in 2026\n\n- **Tailwind CSS v4** integration (improved performance)\n- **Shared component library** across multiple apps\n- **Type-safe** with TypeScript\n- **Fast builds** with Turborepo caching\n- **Independent versioning** per package\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n- **Multiple apps**: Share the same UI package across web, docs, admin apps\n- **Theming**: Configure CSS variables in each app while sharing components\n- **Component customization**: Override styles per app while maintaining core components\n\nSources:\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI with

tsconfig.json**\nEnsure proper TypeScript path mappings in your app's `tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@repo/ui\": [\"../../packages/ui\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Key Benefits in 2026\n\n- **Tailwind CSS v4** integration (improved performance)\n- **Shared component library** across multiple apps\n- **Type-safe** with TypeScript\n- **Fast builds** with Turborepo caching\n- **Independent versioning** per package\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n- **Multiple apps**: Share the same UI package across web, docs, admin apps\n- **Theming**: Configure CSS variables in each app while sharing components\n- **Component customization**: Override styles per app while maintaining core components\n\nSources:\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI

Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n# or\nyarn add swiper\n# or\npnpm add swiper\n```\n\n### 2. Basic Implementation\n\nCreate a component file (e.g., `ImageSlider.tsx`):\n\n```tsx\n'use client'; // Required for Next.js App Router\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\n\nconst images = [\n  { src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function ImageSlider() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"w-full\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{ delay: 3000, disableOnInteraction: false }}\n        loop={true}\n        className=\"w-full h-[500px] md:h-[600px]\"\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <div className=\"relative w-full h-full\">\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                fill\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                priority={index === 0}\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Custom Styling for Full-Width\n\nAdd custom CSS (e.g., `globals.css` or component-specific styles):\n\n```css\n.swiper {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\n.swiper-slide {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-size: 18px;\n  background: #000;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n/* Custom navigation buttons */\n.swiper-button-next,\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: white;\n  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n  padding: 20px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  width: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n}\n\n.swiper-button-next:after,\n.swiper-button-prev:after {\n  font-size: 20px;\n}\n\n/* Custom pagination */\n.swiper-pagination-bullet {\n  background: white;\n  opacity: 0.7;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n```\n\n### 4.

This approach has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability in 2025.\n\n### Key Methodology\n\n**1. Feature Identification**\n\nThe process begins by using pretrained SAEs to decompose model activations into sparse, interpretable features:\n\n- **SAE Architecture**: For each transformer layer, an SAE encodes the residual activation into a sparse code with dimensions like 16,384 features\n- **Contrastive Analysis**: Identify language-specific features by computing activation differences between parallel sentences in different languages\n- Use datasets like Tatoeba Project (1,000 parallel sentence pairs per language) to find features that differentiate languages\n\n**2. Feature Selection**\n\nCalculate the contrastive feature difference for each layer:\n- Compare mean SAE feature activations across target language vs. English inputs\n- Alternative: Use only final token activations for more focused steering\n- Select top-k features (typically k=3) with largest absolute differences\n\n**3.

The app allows users to send live photos directly to friends' home screens through an iOS widget - creating an intimate, personal connection.\n\n**The Viral Marketing Strategy**:\n\n### Phase 1: Nano-Influencer Assault\nLocket employed a groundbreaking TikTok strategy centered on **nano and micro-influencers**.

Here's what's happening and how to fix it:\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe error \"The executable `cd` could not be found\" occurs when Railway tries to execute a custom start command that includes the `cd` command, but the base image you're using doesn't have basic shell utilities installed.\n\n## The Solution\n\n### 1. Remove the Custom Start Command in Railway Settings\n\nThe primary fix is to **remove any custom start command** you've configured in your Railway service settings:\n\n- Go to your Railway project\n- Navigate to your service settings\n- Find the \"Start Command\" field under Deploy settings\n- Delete/clear the start command field\n- Let Railway use the CMD or ENTRYPOINT defined in your Dockerfile instead\n\n### 2. Fix Your Dockerfile\n\nIf you're using a multi-stage build with a minimal base image (like `ubuntu:22.04` or `alpine`), ensure your final stage has the necessary runtime:\n\n**Wrong approach:**\n```dockerfile\n# Final stage with wrong base image\nFROM ubuntu:22.04\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=build /app/binary ./\n# Missing CMD/ENTRYPOINT\n```\n\n**Correct approach:**\n```dockerfile\n# For Node.js apps\nFROM node:18-slim\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=build /app ./\nCMD [\"node\", \"index.js\"]\n\n# For Go apps with minimal image\nFROM alpine:latest\nRUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=build /app/binary ./\nCMD [\"./binary\"]\n```\n\n### 3. Ensure Your Dockerfile Has CMD or ENTRYPOINT\n\nAlways include a CMD or ENTRYPOINT in your Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Use array syntax (recommended)\nCMD [\"./main\"]\n\n# Or for Node.js\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\n\n# Or use ENTRYPOINT\nENTRYPOINT [\"./app\"]\n```\n\n### 4. Avoid Using Shell Commands in Railway Start Command\n\nDon't use shell commands like `cd`, `&&`, or other bash syntax in Railway's start command field. If you need to change directories or run multiple commands, handle this in your Dockerfile using WORKDIR and proper CMD syntax.\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nRailway's container runtime expects either:\n1.

{"id":"websearch-1470","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","output":"Based on the latest information from 2026, here's how to properly handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs:\n\n## Best Practices for Checkbox Label and Input Interaction\n\n### 1. **Use Proper Label Association (Recommended)**\n\nThe most accessible and standard approach is to use the `htmlFor` attribute on labels with a matching `id` on inputs:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction CheckboxExample() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <label htmlFor=\"my-checkbox\">Enable Feature</label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        id=\"my-checkbox\"\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Users can click either the label text or checkbox to toggle\n- Accessible for screen readers\n- No need for onClick handlers on labels\n- Standard HTML behavior\n\n### 2. **Wrapped Label Pattern**\n\nYou can also wrap the input inside the label element:\n\n```jsx\nfunction CheckboxExample() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)}\n      />\n      Enable Feature\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Avoid onClick on Labels**\n\n**Don't do this:**\n```jsx\n// ❌ Incorrect - causes double-firing\n<label onClick={() => setIsChecked(!isChecked)}>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isChecked} />\n  Label\n</label>\n```\n\nThis creates issues because clicking the label already triggers the input click naturally.\n\n### 4. **Multiple Checkboxes with Object State**\n\n```jsx\nfunction PreferencesForm() {\n  const [preferences, setPreferences] = useState({\n    newsletter: false,\n    notifications: true,\n    darkMode: false\n  });\n\n  const handleChange = (key) => {\n    setPreferences(prev => ({\n      ...prev,\n      [key]: !prev[key]\n    }));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>User Preferences</legend>\n      \n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"newsletter\">Newsletter</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"newsletter\"\n          checked={preferences.newsletter}\n          onChange={() => handleChange('newsletter')}\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"notifications\">Notifications</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"notifications\"\n          checked={preferences.notifications}\n          onChange={() => handleChange('notifications')}\n        />\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Checkbox Group with Array State**\n\n```jsx\nfunction SkillSelector() {\n  const [selectedSkills, setSelectedSkills] = useState(['react']);\n\n  const handleSkillChange = (skill) => {\n    setSelectedSkills(prev =>\n      prev.includes(skill)\n        ? prev.filter(s => s !== skill)\n        : [...prev, skill]\n    );\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>Select Skills</legend>\n      \n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"react\">React</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"react\"\n          checked={selectedSkills.includes('react')}\n          onChange={() => handleSkillChange('react')}\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"vue\">Vue</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"vue\"\n          checked={selectedSkills.includes('vue')}\n          onChange={() => handleSkillChange('vue')}\n        />\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways for 2026\n\n1. **Always use controlled components** with the `checked` prop tied to state\n2. **Use `onChange` handler**, not `onClick` on checkboxes\n3. **Associate labels properly** using `htmlFor`/`id` or wrapping pattern\n4. **Wrap related checkboxes** in `<fieldset>` with `<legend>` for accessibility\n5. **Use `event.target.checked`** to get the boolean value in handlers\n6. **Update state immutably** when working with arrays or objects\n7. **Avoid onClick handlers on labels** -

causes double-firing\n<label onClick={() => setIsChecked(!isChecked)}>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isChecked} />\n  Label\n</label>\n```\n\nThis creates issues because clicking the label already triggers the input click naturally.\n\n### 4. **Multiple Checkboxes with Object State**\n\n```jsx\nfunction PreferencesForm() {\n  const [preferences, setPreferences] = useState({\n    newsletter: false,\n    notifications: true,\n    darkMode: false\n  });\n\n  const handleChange = (key) => {\n    setPreferences(prev => ({\n      ...prev,\n      [key]: !prev[key]\n    }));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>User Preferences</legend>\n      \n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"newsletter\">Newsletter</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"newsletter\"\n          checked={preferences.newsletter}\n          onChange={() => handleChange('newsletter')}\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"notifications\">Notifications</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"notifications\"\n          checked={preferences.notifications}\n          onChange={() => handleChange('notifications')}\n        />\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Checkbox Group with Array State**\n\n```jsx\nfunction SkillSelector() {\n  const [selectedSkills, setSelectedSkills] = useState(['react']);\n\n  const handleSkillChange = (skill) => {\n    setSelectedSkills(prev =>\n      prev.includes(skill)\n        ? prev.filter(s => s !== skill)\n        : [...prev, skill]\n    );\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <fieldset>\n      <legend>Select Skills</legend>\n      \n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"react\">React</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"react\"\n          checked={selectedSkills.includes('react')}\n          onChange={() => handleSkillChange('react')}\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"vue\">Vue</label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          id=\"vue\"\n          checked={selectedSkills.includes('vue')}\n          onChange={() => handleSkillChange('vue')}\n        />\n      </div>\n    </fieldset>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways for 2026\n\n1. **Always use controlled components** with the `checked` prop tied to state\n2. **Use `onChange` handler**, not `onClick` on checkboxes\n3. **Associate labels properly** using `htmlFor`/`id` or wrapping pattern\n4. **Wrap related checkboxes** in `<fieldset>` with `<legend>` for accessibility\n5. **Use `event.target.checked`** to get the boolean value in handlers\n6. **Update state immutably** when working with arrays or objects\n7. **Avoid onClick handlers on labels** - let native HTML behavior handle it\n\nThis approach ensures your checkboxes are accessible, performant, and follow React best practices in 2026.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Checkbox in React: The Complete Guide -

{"id":"websearch-1548","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","output":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive explanation of LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection.\n\n## LoadLibraryEx Decoy DLL Memory Hollowing Process Injection\n\n**LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing** (also known as **Module Stomping**, **Module Overloading**, or **DLL Hollowing**) is a stealthy process injection technique that became increasingly popular in 2024 for evading security detections. Here's how it works:\n\n### Technical Process\n\n**Step 1: Load a Benign DLL**\n- The attacker uses `LoadLibrary` or `LoadLibraryEx` to load a legitimate Windows DLL (the \"decoy\") into either:\n  - The current process (simple variant)\n  - A remote target process (advanced variant)\n- Common decoy DLLs include `amsi.dll`, `winhttp.dll`, or other system DLLs\n- The function returns the base address where the DLL is loaded in memory\n\n**Step 2: Locate the DLL's Entry Point**\n- Parse the DLL's PE (Portable Executable) headers:\n  - Read the DOS header (MZ header)\n  - Follow `e_lfanew` offset to find the NT/PE header\n  - Extract `AddressOfEntryPoint` from the Optional Header\n- Calculate actual entry point: `Base Address + AddressOfEntryPoint`\n- This typically points to `DllMain` or `DllMainCRTStartup`\n\n**Step 3: Overwrite Entry Point with Shellcode**\n- Modify memory permissions at entry point to `PAGE_READWRITE` using `VirtualProtect` (local) or `VirtualProtectEx` (remote)\n- Use `memcpy` (local) or `WriteProcessMemory` (remote) to overwrite the entry point with malicious shellcode\n- Restore original memory permissions (often `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`)\n\n**Step 4: Execute the Shellcode**\n- Create a new thread pointing to the compromised entry point:\n  - `CreateThread` for local process\n  - `CreateRemoteThread` for remote process\n- The thread executes from what appears to be a legitimate DLL location\n\n### Key Code Example (Remote Process Variant)\n\n```c\n// 1. Inject benign DLL name into remote process\nremoteDLLName = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, dllNameSize, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, remoteDLLName, \"amsi.dll\", dllNameSize, NULL);\n\n// 2. Force remote process to load the DLL\nloadLibAddr = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(\"Kernel32\"), \"LoadLibraryA\");\nCreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, loadLibAddr, remoteDLLName, 0, NULL);\n\n// 3. Find the loaded DLL in remote process\nEnumProcessModules(hProcess, modules, sizeof(modules), &moduleSize);\n// Loop to find amsi.dll base address\n\n// 4. Read DLL headers from remote process\nReadProcessMemory(hProcess, dllBase, headerBuffer, 0x1000, NULL);\nPIMAGE_DOS_HEADER dosHdr = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)headerBuffer;\nPIMAGE_NT_HEADERS ntHdr = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)(headerBuffer + dosHdr->e_lfanew);\nentryPoint = dllBase + ntHdr->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint;\n\n// 5. Overwrite entry point with shellcode\nWriteProcessMemory(hProcess, entryPoint, shellcode, shellcodeSize, NULL);\n\n// 6. Execute from DLL entry point\nCreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, entryPoint, NULL, 0, NULL);\n```\n\n### Advantages (from attacker perspective)\n\n1. **No RWX Memory**: Never allocates or changes permissions to RWX (Read-Write-Execute), avoiding common security detections\n2. **Legitimate DLL Path**: Shellcode resides in a Windows system DLL loaded from `C:\\Windows\\System32`, not suspicious locations\n3. **Thread Attribution**: The malicious thread appears to originate from a legitimate Microsoft-signed module\n4. **Blends with Normal Activity**: The DLL is genuinely loaded through normal Windows APIs\n\n### Detection Challenges\n\n- The process tree looks normal (legitimate parent → legitimate child → legitimate DLL)\n- Memory scanning shows shellcode inside a real Windows DLL\n- Thread start address points to legitimate module exports (e.g., `amsi!DllMainCRTStartup`)\n- Stack traces show execution transitioning through genuine DLL addresses\n\n### Detection Opportunities\n\nDespite its stealth, defenders can detect this through:\n\n1. **API Monitoring**: Unusual use of `ReadProcessMemory`/`WriteProcessMemory` (typically debugger APIs)\n2. **Module Load Analysis**: Tracking DLLs loaded into processes where they're not normally needed\n3. **Memory Integrity**: Comparing in-memory DLL code against on-disk versions\n4. **Thread Analysis**: Investigating threads with suspicious start addresses in unexpected modules\n5. **Behavioral Detection**: Monitoring for LoadLibrary + WriteProcessMemory + CreateRemoteThread sequences\n\n### 2024 Relevance\n\nAs of 2024, this technique remains effective because:\n- Many EDR solutions still rely on RWX memory detection\n- It bypasses user-mode hooks in the injected code\n- Security tools often whitelist system DLLs from inspection\n- The technique works on Windows 10/11 without requiring special privileges\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [TrustedSec | Burrowing a Hollow in a DLL to Hide](https://trustedsec.com/blog/burrowing-a-hollow-in-a-dll-to-hide)\n- [Module Stomping for Shellcode Injection | Red Team Notes](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/modulestomping-dll-hollowing-shellcode-injection)\n- [Ten process injection techniques: A technical survey](https://www.elastic.co/blog/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process)\n- [BorderGate - Module Stomping](https://www.bordergate.co.uk/module-stomping/)\n- [VMRay - Detecting DLL hollowing](https://www.vmray.com/december-2024-detection-highlights-detecting-dll-hollowing-and-phishing-using-svgs-and-an-expanded-set-of-new-yara-rules/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection techniques.","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":70560},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Xbz3GZro9mstgfUu8wDi2Z","status":"completed","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information about the LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL technique and memory hollowing:","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":70560},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Ex682sPuDKxku9MhR59dmz","status":"completed","timestamp":70560},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XzLx22cyrJLNKhdDQD75LC","status":"completed","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about LoadLibraryEx and the decoy DLL technique:","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":70560},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FTAXj3KTxz31ENdD3RRAqZ","status":"completed","timestamp":70560},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016jy6FsWUCjqPxcj8rznBZ2","status":"completed","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from one of these sources:","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":70560},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YS1LkeJC7avkcGziM8Rjub","status":"completed","timestamp":70560},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive explanation of LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection.\n\n## LoadLibraryEx Decoy DLL Memory Hollowing Process Injection\n\n**LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing** (also known as **Module Stomping**, **Module Overloading**, or **DLL Hollowing**) is a stealthy process injection technique that became increasingly popular in 2024 for evading security detections.

{"id":"websearch-1592","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the Claude Code skills API in the anthropics/skills GitHub repository for 2026?","output":"Based on the search results and documentation, here's how to use the Claude Code skills API in the anthropics/skills GitHub repository for 2026:\n\n## Creating Skills\n\nSkills in Claude Code are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality. Here's how to use them:\n\n### Basic Skill Structure\n\nEvery skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# Your Skill Name\n\n## Instructions\n[Clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude to follow]\n\n## Examples\n[Concrete examples of using this skill]\n```\n\n### Required Frontmatter Fields\n\n- **name**: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens for spaces, max 64 characters)\n- **description**: Complete description of what the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 characters)\n\n### Optional Frontmatter Fields\n\n- **disable-model-invocation**: Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading the skill (manual `/skill-name` invocation only)\n- **user-invocable**: Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu (background knowledge skills)\n- **allowed-tools**: Tools Claude can use without permission when this skill is active\n- **context**: Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context\n- **agent**: Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set\n- **model**: Model to use when this skill is active\n- **argument-hint**: Hint shown during autocomplete for expected arguments\n\n## Where Skills Live\n\nSkills can be stored at different levels:\n\n- **Personal**: `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (all your projects)\n- **Project**: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (this project only)\n- **Plugin**: `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (where plugin is enabled)\n- **Enterprise**: Via managed settings (organization-wide)\n\n## Using Skills in Claude Code\n\n### Install the Repository as a Plugin Marketplace\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills\n```\n\nThen install specific skill sets:\n\n```bash\n/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills\n/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills\n```\n\n### Using Skills via API\n\nThe Claude API requires three beta headers:\n\n- `code-execution-2025-08-25` - Skills run in the code execution container\n- `skills-2025-10-02` - Enables Skills functionality\n- `files-api-2025-04-14` - Required for uploading/downloading files\n\nSpecify skills using the `skill_id` in the `container` parameter along with the code execution tool.\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### String Substitutions\n\n- `$ARGUMENTS`: All arguments passed when invoking\n- `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or `$N`: Access specific argument by index\n- `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`: Current session ID\n\n### Dynamic Context Injection\n\nUse `!`command`` syntax to run shell commands before the skill content is sent to Claude:\n\n```markdown\n- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`\n- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`\n```\n\n### Supporting Files\n\nSkills can include multiple files:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)\n├── reference.md       # Detailed documentation\n├── examples.md        # Usage examples\n└── scripts/\n    └── helper.py      # Utility scripts\n```\n\n## Progressive Loading\n\nSkills use three levels of content loading:\n\n1. **Level 1 (Metadata)**: Always loaded at startup (~100 tokens per skill)\n2. **Level 2 (Instructions)**: Loaded when skill is triggered (under 5k tokens)\n3. **Level 3+ (Resources)**: Loaded as needed via bash commands (effectively unlimited)\n\nThis ensures only relevant content occupies the context window at any given time.\n\n## Sources\n\n- [GitHub -

{"id":"websearch-1594","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","output":"Based on the search results and documentation, here are some key **Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026**:\n\n## 1. **REST API Pattern** (Simple External Integration)\nFor applications outside Cloudflare Workers, use direct REST API calls:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\n\nACCOUNT_ID = os.environ.get(\"CF_ACCOUNT_ID\")\nAPI_TOKEN = os.environ.get(\"CF_API_TOKEN\")\n\nmodel = \"@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct\"\napi_url = f\"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/{model}\"\n\nheaders = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {API_TOKEN}\"}\nprompt_data = {\"prompt\": \"Where did the phrase Hello World come from\"}\n\nresponse = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=prompt_data)\n```\n\n## 2. **Worker Binding Pattern** (Edge AI Gateway)\nFor production applications, bind the AI service directly within a Cloudflare Worker:\n\n```javascript\n// wrangler.toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n\n// worker.js\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env) {\n    const aiPayload = {\n      messages: [\n        {role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant\"},\n        {role: \"user\", content: \"What is Pascal?\"}\n      ],\n      stream: false\n    };\n    \n    const result = await env.AI.run(\"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\", aiPayload);\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result));\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## 3. **Streaming Response Pattern**\nFor real-time AI interactions with lower perceived latency:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages: [...],\n  stream: true  // Enable streaming\n};\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelName, aiPayload);\n\n// Return as Server-Sent Events (SSE)\nreturn new Response(aiResult, {\n  headers: {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"text/event-stream;charset=utf-8\",\n    \"Cache-Control\": \"no-cache, no-transform\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## 4. **Dynamic Model Selection Pattern**\nAllow clients to choose models at runtime:\n\n```javascript\nconst DEFAULT_MODEL = \"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\";\n\nconst requestBody = await request.json();\nconst { model, messages } = requestBody;\n\nconst modelToUse = model || DEFAULT_MODEL;\nconst result = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, { messages });\n```\n\n## 5. **Tool/Function Calling Pattern** (Advanced Agents)\nBuild AI agents that can call external functions:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages: [...],\n  tools: [\n    {\n      type: \"function\",\n      function: {\n        name: \"get_weather\",\n        description: \"Get weather data\",\n        parameters: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            location: { type: \"string\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nconst result = await env.AI.run(model, aiPayload);\n// Check result.tool_calls for function invocations\n```\n\n## 6. **Secure Private Gateway Pattern**\nProtect AI endpoints with authentication:\n\n```javascript\n// Basic Auth with timing-safe comparison\nconst timingSafeEqual = async (a, b) => {\n  const encoder = new TextEncoder();\n  const aBytes = encoder.encode(a);\n  const bBytes = encoder.encode(b);\n  \n  if (aBytes.byteLength !== bBytes.byteLength) return false;\n  return await crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual(aBytes, bBytes);\n};\n\n// Validate credentials\nconst validUser = await timingSafeEqual(username, env.USERNAME);\nconst validPass = await timingSafeEqual(password, env.PASSWORD);\n```\n\n## 7. **Multi-Modal Pattern**\nDifferent model types for different tasks:\n\n- **Text Generation**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`\n- **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion models\n- **Speech-to-Text**: Whisper models\n- **Image Classification**: ResNet models\n\n## Key Benefits (2026 Context):\n- **Edge-based inference** - Low latency due to Cloudflare's global network\n- **Pay-per-neuron pricing** - No idle GPU costs\n- **Privacy-focused** - Data not used for training\n- **Serverless scaling** - Automatic handling of demand\n- **50+ open-source models** available in the catalog\n\nSources:\n- [Running AI Models on the Edge with Cloudflare Workers

{"id":"websearch-1611","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to store data locally using AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54 according to 2026 documentation?","output":"Based on the 2026 documentation for Expo SDK 54, here's how to store data locally using AsyncStorage:\n\n## Installation\n\nFor Expo projects (including SDK 54), install AsyncStorage using:\n\n```bash\nnpx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\nThis command ensures you get the compatible version for your Expo SDK.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### 1. Import AsyncStorage\n\n```javascript\nimport AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';\n```\n\n### 2. Store Data (setItem)\n\nAsyncStorage only stores strings, so you need to stringify objects:\n\n```javascript\n// Storing a simple string\nconst storeData = async (value) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem('user-name', value);\n    console.log('Data stored successfully');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error storing data:', error);\n  }\n};\n\n// Storing an object (must be stringified)\nconst storeUserData = async (userData) => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = JSON.stringify(userData);\n    await AsyncStorage.setItem('user-data', jsonValue);\n    console.log('User data saved');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to save user data:', error);\n  }\n};\n\n// Example usage\nconst user = {\n  id: 123,\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  email: 'john@example.com'\n};\nstoreUserData(user);\n```\n\n### 3. Retrieve Data (getItem)\n\n```javascript\n// Retrieving a simple value\nconst getData = async () => {\n  try {\n    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user-name');\n    if (value !== null) {\n      console.log('Retrieved value:', value);\n      return value;\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error reading data:', error);\n  }\n};\n\n// Retrieving and parsing an object\nconst getUserData = async () => {\n  try {\n    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user-data');\n    const userData = jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : null;\n    return userData;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error parsing user data:', error);\n    return null;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 4. Remove Data (removeItem)\n\n```javascript\nconst removeData = async (key) => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.removeItem(key);\n    console.log(`Item with key '${key}' removed`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error removing item:', error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 5. Clear All Data\n\n```javascript\nconst clearAllData = async () => {\n  try {\n    await AsyncStorage.clear();\n    console.log('All data cleared');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error clearing data:', error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Batch Operations\n\nFor better performance when working with multiple items:\n\n```javascript\n// Store multiple items at once\nconst storeMultipleItems = async () => {\n  try {\n    const pairs = [\n      ['theme', 'dark'],\n      ['language', 'en'],\n      ['notifications', 'true']\n    ];\n    await AsyncStorage.multiSet(pairs);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Batch store error:', error);\n  }\n};\n\n// Retrieve multiple items at once\nconst getMultipleItems = async () => {\n  try {\n    const keys = ['theme', 'language', 'notifications'];\n    const values = await AsyncStorage.multiGet(keys);\n    return values;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Batch retrieve error:', error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n1. **Not encrypted by default** - Don't store sensitive data like passwords without additional encryption\n2. **Storage limits** - ~6MB on iOS, larger on Android but performance degrades with excessive data\n3. **String-only storage** - Always stringify objects/arrays before storing\n4. **Asynchronous** - All operations return Promises and are non-blocking\n5. **Use Expo SecureStore for sensitive data** - For passwords, tokens, and sensitive information\n\n## Alternative for Sensitive Data\n\nAccording to the Expo SDK 54 documentation, for sensitive data use **expo-secure-store** instead:\n\n```bash\nnpx expo install expo-secure-store\n```\n\nSources:\n- [Expo SDK 54 - Expo Changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog/sdk-54)\n- [Storing Data Permanently in React Native using AsyncStorage 2025](https://medium.com/@mahesh.nikate/storing-data-permanently-in-react-native-using-asyncstorage-2025-91a79b104fdb)\n- [React Native AsyncStorage: Complete Guide to Local Data Storage](https://mernstackdev.com/react-native-asyncstorage/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest information about using AsyncStorage in Expo SDK 54 according to 2026 documentation.","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":52053},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LneoCKYbDj5qLS5GdcFP3p","status":"completed","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the official Expo SDK 54 documentation to get the most accurate information.","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":52053},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BgNMoJKKkHzENKnRdbSjco","status":"completed","timestamp":52053},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01L1ZKqmJ3S8aMmYzbXB449B","status":"completed","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific documentation about AsyncStorage usage with Expo.","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":52053},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MnguGQdydi5Dv53uFkiWnJ","status":"completed","timestamp":52053},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01F8sYr3a8pkmvQ7QYidf1Ws","status":"completed","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get the official documentation for AsyncStorage.","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":52053},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01DSK3YHZuGZAyZYo2CSsGWT","status":"completed","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":52053},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WpLsAywcMBXSTvkn9bwZGj","status":"completed","timestamp":52053},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the 2026 documentation for Expo SDK 54, here's how to store data locally using AsyncStorage:\n\n## Installation\n\nFor Expo projects (including SDK 54), install AsyncStorage using:\n\n```bash\nnpx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\nThis command ensures you get the compatible version for your Expo SDK.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1641","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","output":"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive guide on using Figma plugins to create nodes from JSON structures in 2026:\n\n## Overview\n\nImporting JSON data into Figma allows you to automatically populate designs with real data, saving time and ensuring consistency. You can use plugins or custom scripts to create nodes from JSON structures.\n\n## Methods to Import JSON to Figma\n\n### 1. Using Figma Plugins (Recommended)\n\nPopular plugins for JSON import include:\n- **Data Populator**\n- **JSON to Figma**\n- **Content Reel**\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Install the Plugin**\n   - Open Figma → Plugins menu\n   - Search for a JSON import plugin\n   - Click Install\n\n2. **Prepare Your JSON File**\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\n       \"name\": \"Product 1\",\n       \"description\": \"A fantastic product\",\n       \"price\": 29.99\n     },\n     {\n       \"name\": \"Product 2\",\n       \"description\": \"Another great product\",\n       \"price\": 39.99\n     }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Select Target Layers**\n   - Select the Figma layers you want to populate (text layers, frames, etc.)\n\n4. **Run the Plugin**\n   - Plugins menu → Select your installed plugin\n   - Upload your JSON file\n\n5. **Map JSON Fields to Layers**\n   - Map JSON fields (e.g., \"name\", \"description\", \"price\") to corresponding Figma layers\n   - The plugin UI will guide you through this process\n\n6. **Populate the Data**\n   - Click to populate and the plugin will automatically fill your layers\n   - It will create multiple instances if your JSON contains arrays\n\n### 2. Using the Figma API (Advanced)\n\nFor more control and automation, you can use custom scripts with the Figma API:\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Node.js and npm\n- Figma personal access token\n- JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge\n\n**Process:**\n1.

You can use plugins or custom scripts to create nodes from JSON structures.\n\n## Methods to Import JSON to Figma\n\n### 1. Using Figma Plugins (Recommended)\n\nPopular plugins for JSON import include:\n- **Data Populator**\n- **JSON to Figma**\n- **Content Reel**\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Install the Plugin**\n   - Open Figma → Plugins menu\n   - Search for a JSON import plugin\n   - Click Install\n\n2. **Prepare Your JSON File**\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\n       \"name\": \"Product 1\",\n       \"description\": \"A fantastic product\",\n       \"price\": 29.99\n     },\n     {\n       \"name\": \"Product 2\",\n       \"description\": \"Another great product\",\n       \"price\": 39.99\n     }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Select Target Layers**\n   - Select the Figma layers you want to populate (text layers, frames, etc.)\n\n4. **Run the Plugin**\n   - Plugins menu → Select your installed plugin\n   - Upload your JSON file\n\n5. **Map JSON Fields to Layers**\n   - Map JSON fields (e.g., \"name\", \"description\", \"price\") to corresponding Figma layers\n   - The plugin UI will guide you through this process\n\n6. **Populate the Data**\n   - Click to populate and the plugin will automatically fill your layers\n   - It will create multiple instances if your JSON contains arrays\n\n### 2. Using the Figma API (Advanced)\n\nFor more control and automation, you can use custom scripts with the Figma API:\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Node.js and npm\n- Figma personal access token\n- JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge\n\n**Process:**\n1. Authenticate with Figma API\n2. Read and parse your JSON file\n3. Connect to your Figma file using the file ID\n4. Find target layers by name or ID\n5. Update layer content programmatically\n6. Execute the script to create nodes from your JSON structure\n\n### 3. Manual Copy-Paste (Simple Cases)\n\nFor small amounts of data, you can manually copy data from JSON and paste into Figma text layers.\n\n## Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Structure Your JSON Properly** - Use clear, logical structures with descriptive field names\n2. **Test Your Data** - Validate JSON before importing to catch errors early\n3. **Use Plugins for Ease** - Unless you need custom behavior, plugins provide the best user experience\n4. **Automate When Possible** - For frequent imports, consider API-based solutions\n5. **Version Control** - Keep your JSON data sources in version control alongside designs\n6. **Design Systems Integration** - Many 2026 workflows integrate JSON import with design tokens and variables\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Plugin not working**: Restart Figma, check plugin documentation\n- **Data mapping issues**: Verify field names match between JSON and Figma layers\n- **Invalid JSON**: Use a JSON validator before importing\n- **API errors**: Verify authentication tokens and file permissions\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Time savings**: Automate data entry instead of manual typing\n- **Consistency**: Ensure accurate data across your designs\n- **Dynamic updates**: Modify JSON file to update designs instantly\n- **Team collaboration**: Share data sources for unified workflows\n\nSources:\n- [Import JSON Data To Figma: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://biddybytes.com/blog/import-json-data-to-figma-1762611118104)\n- [Figma JSON: Importing And Exporting Designs](https://kibana.briz.ua/blog/figma-json-importing-and-exporting-designs-1764801644)\n- [Built a Figma plugin: Text Export / Import JSON](https://www.reddit.com/r/FigmaDesign/comments/1no9tit/built_a_figma_plugin_text_export_import_json_for/)\n- [We built a free Figma to JSON Exporter plugin](https://www.reddit.com/r/FigmaDesign/comments/1m0efwp/we_built_a_free_figma_to_json_exporter_plugin/)","timestamp":49597}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"Figma_Plugin","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769687249590,"end":1769687299186,"firstResponse":49597,"sessionCreation":0,"total":49596},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.89,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

The error occurs because:\n\n1. **LLMs return incorrect field names**: The model expects `name` but some LLMs return `entity_name`\n2. **Schema vs. data confusion**: Some LLMs return the JSON schema definition instead of actual data\n3. **Lack of structured output support**: Many OpenAI-compatible providers don't support the `response_format` parameter properly\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n\n#### 1. **Use Compatible LLM Providers**\n\nThe most reliable solution is to use LLM providers with strong JSON structured output support:\n\n- **OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4.1** - Best compatibility (recommended)\n- **Anthropic Claude** - Strong structured output support\n- Avoid smaller local models (Llama 3.1, DeepSeek-R1:7b) unless properly configured\n\n#### 2. **Use OpenAIClient Instead of OpenAIGenericClient**\n\nIf you're using an OpenAI-compatible provider (like OpenRouter), switch from `OpenAIGenericClient` to `OpenAIClient`:\n\n```python\nfrom graphiti_core.llm_client import LLMConfig\nfrom graphiti_core.llm_client.openai_client import OpenAIClient\n\nllm_config = LLMConfig(\n    api_key=\"your_api_key\",\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    small_model=\"gpt-4\",\n    base_url=\"https://your-provider-url.com/v1\",\n    temperature=0.1,\n)\n\nllm_client = OpenAIClient(config=llm_config)  # Use OpenAIClient, not OpenAIGenericClient\n```\n\n#### 3. **Implement Structured Outputs with Strict Schema Enforcement**\n\nFor advanced use cases, implement a structured outputs patch that uses `json_schema` with strict enforcement:\n\n```python\n# Use response_format with strict schema\nresponse_format = {\n    'type': 'json_schema',\n    'json_schema': {\n        'strict': True,\n        'schema': ExtractedEntities.model_json_schema()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach:\n- Reduces validation errors by ~90%\n- Prevents schema definition returns\n- Provides automatic fallback to basic JSON object mode if strict enforcement fails\n\n#### 4. **Current Best Practices (2026)**\n\nAccording to the graphiti maintainers:\n\n> \"We strongly recommend using larger models capable of outputting well-formed JSON.\"\n\nKey recommendations:\n- Use models with proven structured output support\n- Test with the official OpenAI service first before trying alternatives\n- Ensure your LLM provider supports the `beta.chat.completions.parse()` endpoint\n- Consider using separate endpoints for LLM and embedder if needed\n\n### Version Information\n\n- **Graphiti Version**: 0.20.4+ (as of the latest issues)\n- **Python**: 3.12+\n- **Pydantic**: 2.11+\n- Works with Neo4j 5.26+\n\n### Troubleshooting Checklist\n\nIf you encounter `ExtractedEntities` validation errors:\n\n1.

The error occurs because:\n\n1. **LLMs return incorrect field names**: The model expects `name` but some LLMs return `entity_name`\n2. **Schema vs. data confusion**: Some LLMs return the JSON schema definition instead of actual data\n3. **Lack of structured output support**: Many OpenAI-compatible providers don't support the `response_format` parameter properly\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n\n#### 1. **Use Compatible LLM Providers**\n\nThe most reliable solution is to use LLM providers with strong JSON structured output support:\n\n- **OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4.1** - Best compatibility (recommended)\n- **Anthropic Claude** - Strong structured output support\n- Avoid smaller local models (Llama 3.1, DeepSeek-R1:7b) unless properly configured\n\n#### 2. **Use OpenAIClient Instead of OpenAIGenericClient**\n\nIf you're using an OpenAI-compatible provider (like OpenRouter), switch from `OpenAIGenericClient` to `OpenAIClient`:\n\n```python\nfrom graphiti_core.llm_client import LLMConfig\nfrom graphiti_core.llm_client.openai_client import OpenAIClient\n\nllm_config = LLMConfig(\n    api_key=\"your_api_key\",\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    small_model=\"gpt-4\",\n    base_url=\"https://your-provider-url.com/v1\",\n    temperature=0.1,\n)\n\nllm_client = OpenAIClient(config=llm_config)  # Use OpenAIClient, not OpenAIGenericClient\n```\n\n#### 3. **Implement Structured Outputs with Strict Schema Enforcement**\n\nFor advanced use cases, implement a structured outputs patch that uses `json_schema` with strict enforcement:\n\n```python\n# Use response_format with strict schema\nresponse_format = {\n    'type': 'json_schema',\n    'json_schema': {\n        'strict': True,\n        'schema': ExtractedEntities.model_json_schema()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach:\n- Reduces validation errors by ~90%\n- Prevents schema definition returns\n- Provides automatic fallback to basic JSON object mode if strict enforcement fails\n\n#### 4. **Current Best Practices (2026)**\n\nAccording to the graphiti maintainers:\n\n> \"We strongly recommend using larger models capable of outputting well-formed JSON.\"\n\nKey recommendations:\n- Use models with proven structured output support\n- Test with the official OpenAI service first before trying alternatives\n- Ensure your LLM provider supports the `beta.chat.completions.parse()` endpoint\n- Consider using separate endpoints for LLM and embedder if needed\n\n### Version Information\n\n- **Graphiti Version**: 0.20.4+ (as of the latest issues)\n- **Python**: 3.12+\n- **Pydantic**: 2.11+\n- Works with Neo4j 5.26+\n\n### Troubleshooting Checklist\n\nIf you encounter `ExtractedEntities` validation errors:\n\n1. Verify your LLM provider supports structured outputs\n2. Try switching to `OpenAIClient` instead of `OpenAIGenericClient`\n3. Test with official OpenAI models first\n4. Check that your model can generate properly formatted JSON\n5. Review the LLM response in error logs to see the actual output format\n6.

{"id":"websearch-1770","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow does the /mnt/code directory structure work for Baseten training file paths in 2026?","output":"Based on my research using You.com's search capabilities, I can provide you with information about how the `/mnt/code` directory structure works for Baseten training file paths in 2026:\n\n## How the `/mnt/code` Directory Structure Works for Baseten Training\n\n### Overview\n\nIn Baseten's training infrastructure, `/mnt/code` serves as the **working directory mount point** where your training code and files are placed when a training job runs. This is a containerized environment convention that Baseten uses to provide a consistent file structure across all training jobs.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Directory Structure\n\n**1. How It Works:**\n- When you create a training project directory locally and run `truss train push config.py`, Baseten packages up your entire directory\n- This packaged directory is then mounted at `/mnt/code` inside the training container\n- All your training scripts, configuration files, and any other files you include in your project directory become accessible at this path\n\n**2. File Path Structure:**\n```\n/mnt/code/\n├── config.py           # Your training configuration\n├── train.py            # Your training script\n├── run.sh              # Startup script (if included)\n├── data/               # Any data files you included\n└── [other files]       # Any other files from your project directory\n```\n\n**3. Important Mount Points (as of 2026):**\n\nAccording to the official Baseten documentation, there are several key directories:\n\n- **`/mnt/code`** - Your training code and project files (working directory)\n- **`/mnt/ckpts`** or **`$BT_CHECKPOINT_DIR`** - Where checkpoints are automatically saved when checkpointing is enabled\n- **`/root/.cache/user_artifacts`** or **`$BT_PROJECT_CACHE_DIR`** - Project-specific cache for datasets/models\n- **`/root/.cache/team_artifacts`** or **`$BT_TEAM_CACHE_DIR`** - Team-wide cache shared across projects\n- **`/root/.cache/huggingface`** - Hugging Face specific cache location\n\n### Best Practices for File Paths\n\n**1. Relative Paths:**\nSince `/mnt/code` is your working directory, use relative paths in your training scripts:\n```python\n# Good - relative path\ndataset_path = \"data/train.csv\"\n\n# Also works - absolute path\ndataset_path = \"/mnt/code/data/train.csv\"\n```\n\n**2.

This is a containerized environment convention that Baseten uses to provide a consistent file structure across all training jobs.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Directory Structure\n\n**1. How It Works:**\n- When you create a training project directory locally and run `truss train push config.py`, Baseten packages up your entire directory\n- This packaged directory is then mounted at `/mnt/code` inside the training container\n- All your training scripts, configuration files, and any other files you include in your project directory become accessible at this path\n\n**2. File Path Structure:**\n```\n/mnt/code/\n├── config.py           # Your training configuration\n├── train.py            # Your training script\n├── run.sh              # Startup script (if included)\n├── data/               # Any data files you included\n└── [other files]       # Any other files from your project directory\n```\n\n**3. Important Mount Points (as of 2026):**\n\nAccording to the official Baseten documentation, there are several key directories:\n\n- **`/mnt/code`** - Your training code and project files (working directory)\n- **`/mnt/ckpts`** or **`$BT_CHECKPOINT_DIR`** - Where checkpoints are automatically saved when checkpointing is enabled\n- **`/root/.cache/user_artifacts`** or **`$BT_PROJECT_CACHE_DIR`** - Project-specific cache for datasets/models\n- **`/root/.cache/team_artifacts`** or **`$BT_TEAM_CACHE_DIR`** - Team-wide cache shared across projects\n- **`/root/.cache/huggingface`** - Hugging Face specific cache location\n\n### Best Practices for File Paths\n\n**1. Relative Paths:**\nSince `/mnt/code` is your working directory, use relative paths in your training scripts:\n```python\n# Good - relative path\ndataset_path = \"data/train.csv\"\n\n# Also works - absolute path\ndataset_path = \"/mnt/code/data/train.csv\"\n```\n\n**2. Checkpointing:**\nAlways save checkpoints to the designated checkpoint directory:\n```python\nimport os\ncheckpoint_dir = os.environ.get(\"BT_CHECKPOINT_DIR\", \"/mnt/ckpts\")\n# Save your model to checkpoint_dir\n```\n\n**3. Caching:**\nFor persistent data like large models or datasets, use the cache directories to avoid re-downloading:\n```python\ncache_dir = os.environ.get(\"BT_PROJECT_CACHE_DIR\", \"/root/.cache/user_artifacts\")\n```\n\n### Environment Variables (2026)\n\nBaseten provides these environment variables to help you reference the correct paths:\n\n| Variable | Purpose | Example Value |\n|----------|---------|---------------|\n| `BT_CHECKPOINT_DIR` | Checkpoint storage | `/mnt/ckpts` |\n| `BT_PROJECT_CACHE_DIR` | Project cache | `/root/.cache/user_artifacts` |\n| `BT_TEAM_CACHE_DIR` | Team-wide cache | `/root/.cache/team_artifacts` |\n| `BT_TRAINING_JOB_ID` | Job identifier | `\"gvpql31\"` |\n| `BT_NUM_GPUS` | GPUs per node | `\"4\"` |\n\n### Workflow Summary\n\n1. **Local Development:** Create your training project directory with `config.py`, training scripts, and any data files\n2. **Push to Baseten:** Run `truss train push config.py` - Baseten packages and uploads your directory\n3. **Container Execution:** Your files are mounted at `/mnt/code` inside the training container\n4. **File Access:** Your training scripts can access files using relative paths or `/mnt/code/` prefixed paths\n5. **Checkpoints:** Models are saved to `$BT_CHECKPOINT_DIR` and automatically synced to Baseten storage\n\nThis structure ensures consistency, isolation, and easy file management across all Baseten training jobs.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Training - Baseten SDK Reference](https://docs.baseten.co/reference/sdk/training)\n- [Basics - Baseten Training Concepts](https://docs.baseten.co/training/concepts/basics)\n- [Cache - Baseten Training Concepts](https://docs.baseten.co/training/concepts/cache)\n- [Training on Baseten Overview](https://docs.baseten.co/training/overview)\n- [The /mnt directory definition by The Linux Information Project](https://www.linfo.org/mnt.html)","timestamp":73659}],"metadata":{"category":"Documentation","subcategory":"Baseten","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769687702147,"end":1769687775806,"firstResponse":73659,"sessionCreation":0,"total":73659},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1806","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","output":"Based on the documentation I've gathered, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about using the Rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through a relay in 2026.\n\n## How to Use the Rust libp2p Relay Client Behaviour to Dial Through the Relay API in 2026\n\nIn 2026, libp2p uses **Circuit Relay v2** protocol. Here's how to use the relay client behaviour to dial through a relay:\n\n### 1. Setup and Dependencies\n\nAdd libp2p to your `Cargo.toml` with the relay feature:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.56\", features = [\"relay\", \"tcp\", \"noise\", \"yamux\", \"identify\"] }\n```\n\n### 2. Creating the Relay Client Behaviour and Transport\n\nThe key is to use the `relay::client::new()` function which creates both the behaviour and transport:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{relay, swarm::SwarmBuilder, Multiaddr, PeerId};\n\n// Create the relay client behaviour and transport\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n```\n\n### 3. Dialing Through a Relay\n\nTo dial through a relay, you need to:\n\n**A. Use a relay-circuit multiaddr format:**\n\nThe multiaddr format for dialing through a relay is:\n```\n/ip4/<RELAY_IP>/tcp/<RELAY_PORT>/p2p/<RELAY_PEER_ID>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<TARGET_PEER_ID>\n```\n\n**B. Example dialing code:**\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::swarm::SwarmEvent;\n\n// Build the relay address\nlet relay_address = format!(\n    \"/ip4/{}/tcp/{}/p2p/{}/p2p-circuit/p2p/{}\",\n    relay_ip,\n    relay_port,\n    relay_peer_id,\n    target_peer_id\n);\n\n// Parse the multiaddr\nlet addr: Multiaddr = relay_address.parse()?;\n\n// Dial through the relay\nswarm.dial(addr)?;\n```\n\n### 4. Complete Example Pattern\n\nHere's a typical pattern for a client that dials through a relay:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay,\n    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, SwarmBuilder, SwarmEvent},\n    Multiaddr, PeerId,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct MyBehaviour {\n    relay: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    // ... other behaviours like identify, ping, etc.\n}\n\nasync fn dial_via_relay(\n    swarm: &mut Swarm<MyBehaviour>,\n    relay_addr: &str,\n    remote_peer_id: PeerId,\n) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    // First, connect to the relay\n    let relay_multiaddr: Multiaddr = relay_addr.parse()?;\n    swarm.dial(relay_multiaddr.clone())?;\n    \n    // Then dial the target peer through the relay\n    let relay_circuit_addr = format!(\"{}/p2p-circuit/p2p/{}\", relay_addr, remote_peer_id);\n    let circuit_addr: Multiaddr = relay_circuit_addr.parse()?;\n    \n    swarm.dial(circuit_addr)?;\n    \n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Key Concepts for 2026\n\n**Relay Reservation (for listening clients):**\n- If you want to be reachable through a relay, your client needs to make a **reservation** with the relay\n- The relay client behaviour handles this automatically when configured\n\n**The `/p2p-circuit` Protocol:**\n- This is the key protocol component in the multiaddr that indicates you're dialing through a relay\n- Format: `<relay-address>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<target-peer-id>`\n\n**Event Handling:**\n- Listen for `relay::client::Event` to track reservation status and relay connection events\n- Key events: `ReservationReqAccepted`, `OutboundCircuitEstablished`\n\n### 6. Practical Tutorial Reference\n\nThe official libp2p hole punching tutorial provides working examples. You can find the complete dcutr-example code that demonstrates:\n- Setting up a relay server\n- Listening through a relay (making a reservation)\n- Dialing through a relay to reach NAT'd peers\n- Upgrading to direct connections via DCUtR (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay)\n\n### 7. Important Notes\n\n- Circuit Relay v2 is the current version (v1 is deprecated)\n- The relay client behaviour automatically handles protocol negotiation\n- For hole punching scenarios, combine with `libp2p-dcutr` to upgrade relay connections to direct connections\n- The latest version as of 2026 is libp2p 0.56.0 with libp2p-relay 0.21.0\n\nSources:\n- [libp2p::relay - Rust Documentation](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/index.html)\n- [libp2p::relay::client - Rust Documentation](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/index.html)\n- [libp2p Hole Punching Tutorial](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/tutorials/hole_punching/index.html)\n- [libp2p-relay Crate Documentation](https://lib.rs/crates/libp2p-relay)\n- [rust-libp2p GitHub Repository](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/master/libp2p/src/tutorials/hole_punching.rs)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about using the Rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026.","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016T1R4dmm7oDiP97crwe9Kx","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information about the libp2p relay client behaviour and its documentation.","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016KAqaSVcQRrQ9vGTh3eQXx","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019JcudJ4HMdyjjmQD9D6FBb","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the official Rust documentation for the libp2p relay module to get the most accurate and up-to-date information.","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0117Qus39ijMyvPCAW1CANDu","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific API examples for the relay client behaviour and its dial methods.","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0143YRtQ6yPABT8rK4acJm7F","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Jcx22K7zQhCDdHXjGRY3jT","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for specific code examples in the rust-libp2p repository.","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AEi6q6n5dZwVwUQBJ3udLe","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0155vWuWrfVCattTZqfe2mcH","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get the actual example code from the GitHub repository.","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GevK1C1VNJsUg2okLyqGKp","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01TtD4ehzHucmR9HmCaYVMkq","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the relay client documentation to get the specific API details.","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":75980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012ZQA5rSTpRu9GntpCdcmDu","status":"completed","timestamp":75980},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the documentation I've gathered, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about using the Rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through a relay in 2026.\n\n## How to Use the Rust libp2p Relay Client Behaviour to Dial Through the Relay API in 2026\n\nIn 2026, libp2p uses **Circuit Relay v2** protocol.

{"id":"websearch-1828","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?","output":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on integrating YiPay (EPay/易支付) with one-api and new-api in 2026:\n\n## Overview\n\n**YiPay (易支付/EPay)** is not a specific company but rather a generic term for \"third-party aggregated payment gateway\" systems. It aggregates multiple payment channels like WeChat Pay, Alipay, and bank cards through a unified API interface.\n\n**One-API** and **New-API** are API gateway management systems that allow you to manage multiple AI model channels. New-API is a fork of One-API with additional features including payment/recharge functionality.\n\n## Integration Steps\n\n### 1. Configure YiPay/EPay Payment Gateway\n\nIn the New-API admin panel, navigate to **Settings → Payment Settings** and configure the following:\n\n**Required EPay Fields:**\n- **API Base URL**: Your EPay platform's API endpoint\n- **Merchant ID (PID)**: Your merchant identifier from the EPay provider\n- **Merchant Key (KEY)**: Your secret key for signature verification\n\n### 2. Configure Recharge Methods\n\nSet up payment method options using the following JSON template in the \"Recharge Methods\" field:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"自定义1\",\n    \"color\": \"black\",\n    \"type\": \"custom1\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"50\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Field explanations:**\n- `name`: Display label shown to users (e.g., \"Alipay\", \"WeChat\")\n- `color`: Button/badge color (CSS color value)\n- `type`: Payment channel identifier passed to backend\n- `min_topup`: Minimum recharge amount for this method (optional)\n\n### 3. Configure Recharge Amounts\n\nSet predefined recharge options:\n\n```json\n[10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500]\n```\n\n### 4. Set Up Discount Configuration (Optional)\n\nConfigure discounts for different recharge amounts:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"100\": 0.95,\n  \"200\": 0.9,\n  \"500\": 0.85\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- Key: Recharge amount (as string)\n- Value: Discount rate (0.95 = 95% price = 5% discount)\n\n### 5. Deployment with Docker\n\nFor **New-API** with MySQL database:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e SQL_DSN=\"root:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi\" \\\n  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \\\n  -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data \\\n  calciumion/new-api:latest\n```\n\nFor **SQLite** (default):\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \\\n  -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data \\\n  calciumion/new-api:latest\n```\n\nDefault credentials:\n- Username: `root`\n- Password: `123456`\n\n### 6. Callback Configuration\n\nThe YiPay platform requires a callback URL to notify your system of successful payments. Configure this in your YiPay merchant dashboard:\n\n**Callback URL format:** `https://your-domain.com/api/user/epay/notify`\n\nThe system will:\n1. Receive signed callback from YiPay\n2. Verify the signature using your merchant key\n3. Automatically credit user accounts upon successful verification\n\n## Common Issues & Troubleshooting\n\n### Balance Shows Zero After Payment\n\nThis is a known issue (GitHub Issue #900). If users see \"Balance: 0\" after successful payment:\n\n1. **Verify callback URL** is correctly configured in your YiPay provider\n2. **Check callback logs** in New-API system logs\n3. **Verify merchant credentials** (PID and KEY) match exactly\n4. **Test the payment channel** in your YiPay dashboard first before integrating\n\n**Note:** Some community members have reported reliability issues with certain YiPay providers, so choose a reputable provider.\n\n## Additional Configuration Options\n\nFor optimal performance, consider these environment variables:\n\n- `REDIS_CONN_STRING`: Enable Redis caching for better performance\n  ```bash\n  -e REDIS_CONN_STRING=\"redis://default:password@localhost:6379\"\n  ```\n\n- `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED`: Enable in-memory caching\n  ```bash\n  -e MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED=true\n  ```\n\n## Key Differences: One-API vs New-API\n\n**New-API** includes these payment-related enhancements over One-API:\n- Built-in EPay/YiPay integration\n- Stripe payment support\n- Custom recharge amounts and discount configuration\n- User wallet management\n- Payment history tracking\n- Better UI for payment management\n\n## Important Compliance Notes\n\n1. **Licensing**: EPay gateways are not licensed payment institutions themselves - they aggregate licensed channels\n2. **Regional compliance**: Follow local regulations (especially important in China)\n3. **Usage restrictions**: New-API documentation explicitly states it's for personal channel management, not commercial API distribution\n4. **Data protection**: Ensure PCI-DSS compliance when handling payment data\n\n## Sources:\n- [YiPay Integration Issue #900 - QuantumNous/new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api/issues/900)\n- [Payment Settings Documentation - New API](https://doc.newapi.pro/en/guide/console/settings/payment-settings/)\n- [New-API GitHub Repository - linux-do fork](https://github.com/linux-do/new-api)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about integrating YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026.","timestamp":49026},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":49026},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01D7SJL2semX9nGu6otW5vvg","status":"completed","timestamp":49026},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search more specifically for YiPay, one-api, and new-api which seem to be specific tools/platforms:","timestamp":49026},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":49026},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":49026},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0193iRt9CrEFmLC8xpihhgiK","status":"completed","timestamp":49026},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AXSmW1JTaWJYpCHEy8Pn2j","status":"completed","timestamp":49026},{"type":"message","content":"Good!

Deployment with Docker\n\nFor **New-API** with MySQL database:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e SQL_DSN=\"root:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi\" \\\n  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \\\n  -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data \\\n  calciumion/new-api:latest\n```\n\nFor **SQLite** (default):\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \\\n  -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data \\\n  calciumion/new-api:latest\n```\n\nDefault credentials:\n- Username: `root`\n- Password: `123456`\n\n### 6. Callback Configuration\n\nThe YiPay platform requires a callback URL to notify your system of successful payments. Configure this in your YiPay merchant dashboard:\n\n**Callback URL format:** `https://your-domain.com/api/user/epay/notify`\n\nThe system will:\n1. Receive signed callback from YiPay\n2. Verify the signature using your merchant key\n3. Automatically credit user accounts upon successful verification\n\n## Common Issues & Troubleshooting\n\n### Balance Shows Zero After Payment\n\nThis is a known issue (GitHub Issue #900). If users see \"Balance: 0\" after successful payment:\n\n1. **Verify callback URL** is correctly configured in your YiPay provider\n2. **Check callback logs** in New-API system logs\n3. **Verify merchant credentials** (PID and KEY) match exactly\n4. **Test the payment channel** in your YiPay dashboard first before integrating\n\n**Note:** Some community members have reported reliability issues with certain YiPay providers, so choose a reputable provider.\n\n## Additional Configuration Options\n\nFor optimal performance, consider these environment variables:\n\n- `REDIS_CONN_STRING`: Enable Redis caching for better performance\n  ```bash\n  -e REDIS_CONN_STRING=\"redis://default:password@localhost:6379\"\n  ```\n\n- `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED`: Enable in-memory caching\n  ```bash\n  -e MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED=true\n  ```\n\n## Key Differences: One-API vs New-API\n\n**New-API** includes these payment-related enhancements over One-API:\n- Built-in EPay/YiPay integration\n- Stripe payment support\n- Custom recharge amounts and discount configuration\n- User wallet management\n- Payment history tracking\n- Better UI for payment management\n\n## Important Compliance Notes\n\n1. **Licensing**: EPay gateways are not licensed payment institutions themselves - they aggregate licensed channels\n2. **Regional compliance**: Follow local regulations (especially important in China)\n3. **Usage restrictions**: New-API documentation explicitly states it's for personal channel management, not commercial API distribution\n4. **Data protection**: Ensure PCI-DSS compliance when handling payment data\n\n## Sources:\n- [YiPay Integration Issue #900 - QuantumNous/new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api/issues/900)\n- [Payment Settings Documentation - New API](https://doc.newapi.pro/en/guide/console/settings/payment-settings/)\n- [New-API GitHub Repository - linux-do fork](https://github.com/linux-do/new-api)","timestamp":49026}],"metadata":{"category":"Product_Info","subcategory":"Payment_Service","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769687971189,"end":1769688020215,"firstResponse":49026,"sessionCreation":0,"total":49026},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

competitive barriers through lock-in effects and path dependence in 2026:\n\n## 2026年通过锁定效应和路径依赖构建竞争壁垒的核心策略\n\n### 一、四大核心支柱策略\n\n根据最新研究，构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒需要聚焦以下四个关键领域：\n\n**1. 数据飞轮效应 (Data Flywheel Effects)**\n- 建立专有的、高质量的数据集，而非简单追求数据量\n- 创建自我强化循环：更多用户→更多数据→更好的模型→更优产品→吸引更多用户\n- Tesla案例：通过数百万辆汽车收集超40亿英里真实驾驶数据，构建了资本效率极高的数据护城河\n\n**2. 工作流深度集成 (Workflow Integration)**\n- 将产品深度嵌入客户的日常操作流程（如Slack、Notion、Salesforce）\n- 创造高昂的转换成本，使客户更换供应商需付出巨大代价\n- 这种集成使系统切换需要重大业务中断和人员再培训\n\n**3. 垂直领域专业化 (Domain Specialization)**\n- 聚焦特定细分市场（如医疗、法律、金融服务、制造业）\n- 建立独特的行业专业知识和专有数据访问权\n- 避免与大型平台正面竞争，通过深度胜过广度\n\n**4. 人机协作层 (Human-AI Collaboration)**\n- 在关键决策节点保留人工审核机制\n- 建立客户信任，降低责任风险\n- 虽然扩展性较差，但能创造强大的客户忠诚度\n\n### 二、2026年新兴趋势与机会\n\n**AI原生竞争壁垒**\n- AI投资占2025年风险投资总额的50-53%（约$190-200亿美元）\n- 定制GPT/AI系统成为新的护城河核心\n- 重点不在于技术复杂性，而在于应用层的差异化\n\n**多层飞轮架构**\n- 单一产品飞轮不足以支撑持久业务\n- 需要建立互补飞轮：产品交付、内部AI运营、生态系统合作伙伴\n- 创造多层次、可防御的优势体系\n\n**地理与监管优势**\n- 利用本地化优势：语言、文化理解、监管合规专业知识\n- 欧洲案例：Mistral AI（估值$137亿）、Helsing（估值$130亿）通过区域优势建立竞争地位\n\n### 三、实施路径依赖的关键方法\n\n**选择正确的商业模式架构**\n- **垂直整合模式**（如Tesla）：适用于创造全新物理能力，需要定制芯片和超算基础设施\n- **生态合作模式**（如Walmart）：适用于业务流程优化，可与专业技术公司合作\n\n**建立专有数据护城河**\n通过以下方式确保数据独特性：\n- 独家合作伙伴关系获取独特数据源\n- 严格的数据质量管控流程\n- 用户反馈机制持续改进模型\n- 法律保护（许可协议、服务条款）\n\n**跨用户学习 vs. 单用户学习**\n- **跨用户学习**：数据改善所有用户体验，创造真正的网络效应\n- **单用户学习**：仅改善个别用户体验，主要增加转换成本\n- 前者具有更强的市场主导力\n\n### 四、避免常见陷阱\n\n**1. 避免\"包装器陷阱\"**\n- 单纯封装现有API的产品缺乏防御性\n- 需要通过专有数据或工作流创造真正附加值\n- OpenAI更新导致许多简单包装应用被淘汰\n\n**2. 数据优势的局限性**\n- 数据价值存在边际递减效应\n- \"本地化学习\"问题：一个地区的数据可能无法迁移到其他地区（自动驾驶行业特别明显）\n- 合成数据、迁移学习等技术正在降低进入门槛\n\n**3. 过度估计技术复杂性**\n- 技术先进性本身不足以构成竞争优势\n- 需要关注客户成果而非技术优雅性\n- 问题不是\"AI能做什么\"，而是\"AI能更好地解决什么客户问题\"\n\n### 五、投资者最看重的指标\n\n| 指标类别 | 具体指标 |\n|---------|---------|\n| 模型性能稳定性 | 持续可靠的AI输出；准确率改进 |\n| 市场进入效率 | 合理的CAC回收期；销售周期长度 |\n| 单位经济效益 | 健康的LTV:CAC比率；盈利路径 |\n| 专有数据所有权 | 独特高质量数据集访问；数据飞轮证据 |\n| 已验证需求 | 试点、收入或留存指标验证 |\n\n### 六、2026年关键建议\n\n**速度执行至关重要**\n- 麦肯锡研究显示：快速行动的公司实现高于中位数收入增长的可能性是5倍\n- 必须持续监控、适应并果断行动\n\n**持续强化与再投资**\n- 定期评估竞争护城河强度（建议季度评审）\n-

{"id":"websearch-1891","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025?","output":"Based on my research, here's how to fix breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025:\n\n## Key Breaking Changes and Fixes\n\n### 1. **MCP Tool Schema Meta Parameter Issue (v1.2.7)**\n\n**Problem:** In v1.2.7, there was a bug where metadata was incorrectly added to MCP tool schemas.\n\n**Fix:** Upgrade to v1.2.7+ which includes the fix from PR #3212 that only adds meta to MCP tool schema when it's actually provided.\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade livekit-agents>=1.2.7\n```\n\n### 2. **Agent Silent After Tool Execution (v1.2.7 Regression)**\n\n**Problem:** Agents using ElevenLabs TTS would not respond after executing MCP tools - they would successfully call the tool but remain silent instead of speaking the response.\n\n**Fix:** \n- **Option 1:** Upgrade to v1.2.8+ which includes the fix\n- **Option 2:** Downgrade `livekit-plugins-elevenlabs` to 1.2.6 if you're stuck on 1.2.7\n\n```bash\n# Upgrade approach\npip install --upgrade livekit-agents>=1.2.8 livekit-plugins-elevenlabs>=1.2.8\n\n# Or downgrade approach (if on 1.2.7)\npip install livekit-plugins-elevenlabs==1.2.6\n```\n\n### 3. **StreamableHTTP Transport Support**\n\n**Problem:** Early v1.2.x only supported SSE (deprecated) and stdio for MCP communication, lacking StreamableHTTP support for services like Zapier.\n\n**Fix:** This was added via PR #2394 and merged in later v1.2 releases.

they would successfully call the tool but remain silent instead of speaking the response.\n\n**Fix:** \n- **Option 1:** Upgrade to v1.2.8+ which includes the fix\n- **Option 2:** Downgrade `livekit-plugins-elevenlabs` to 1.2.6 if you're stuck on 1.2.7\n\n```bash\n# Upgrade approach\npip install --upgrade livekit-agents>=1.2.8 livekit-plugins-elevenlabs>=1.2.8\n\n# Or downgrade approach (if on 1.2.7)\npip install livekit-plugins-elevenlabs==1.2.6\n```\n\n### 3. **StreamableHTTP Transport Support**\n\n**Problem:** Early v1.2.x only supported SSE (deprecated) and stdio for MCP communication, lacking StreamableHTTP support for services like Zapier.\n\n**Fix:** This was added via PR #2394 and merged in later v1.2 releases.

{"id":"websearch-1926","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025?","output":"Based on the latest information from October 2025 sources, here are the key best practices for ETL data pipelines:\n\n## Modern ETL Best Practices (October 2025)\n\n### **Architecture & Design Patterns**\n\n**Hybrid Processing Models**: Modern ETL frameworks support both batch and real-time stream processing within the same framework (e.g., Apache Beam), with exactly-once semantics for transactional pipelines.\n\n**Microservices Architecture**: Build ETL pipelines using modular, microservices-based design where each stage (extract, transform, load) can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This enhances flexibility and supports CI/CD practices.\n\n**Event-Driven Architecture**: For real-time use cases, leverage event brokers like Kafka or Redpanda for in-stream data enrichment and transformation.\n\n### **Core Implementation Practices**\n\n1. **Understand Source Systems in Detail**: Thoroughly analyze data sources, their APIs, data formats, and authentication mechanisms. Maintain documentation of data lineage and dependencies.\n\n2. **Implement Granular Data Extraction**: Extract only necessary data fields to reduce volumes and improve performance. Use incremental loading for large datasets and implement filtering at the source.\n\n3. **Design for Modularity**: Break ETL processes into smaller, reusable components for improved maintainability, easier troubleshooting, and enhanced code reuse.\n\n4. **Ensure Fault Tolerance**: Implement robust error handling with automatic retries for transient errors, comprehensive logging, and fallback strategies for unrecoverable errors.\n\n5. **Plan for Scalability**: Design with future data growth in mind, implement parallel processing, auto-scaling capabilities, and regularly test with larger datasets.\n\n### **Data Quality & Governance**\n\n**Data Quality Enforcement**: Build quality checks into ETL workflows using declarative constraints, anomaly detection, and automated handling for flagging or quarantining bad data. Tools like Great Expectations can be integrated natively.\n\n**Metadata Management & Lineage Tracking**: Implement end-to-end lineage tracking from raw source to final report, enable impact analysis, and use unified metadata repositories (DataHub, Amundsen).\n\n**Comprehensive Logging**: Maintain detailed logs capturing information about data sources, transformations, and errors. Use structured logging and log aggregation tools for centralized analysis.\n\n### **Modern Operational Practices**\n\n**Version Control & CI/CD**: Treat ETL logic like application code—version control with Git, make it testable and modular, and deploy using CI/CD pipelines across dev/stage/prod environments.\n\n**Advanced Orchestration**: Use modern orchestration tools (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect) that support dynamic DAGs, retries, SLA enforcement, event- and time-based triggers, and workflow versioning.\n\n**Leverage Cloud Data Warehouse Power**: Implement ELT patterns where appropriate to utilize cloud processing capabilities for complex transformations and take advantage of cloud-native services.\n\n### **Security & Compliance**\n\n- Implement encryption at rest and in motion\n- Apply field-level access control for sensitive data (PII)\n- Maintain immutable audit logs and lineage\n- Establish change management processes for pipeline modifications\n\n### **Monitoring & Optimization**\n\n**Comprehensive Observability**: Track metrics like latency, throughput, and failure rates. Set up custom alerts and provide pipeline-level cost breakdowns, especially for cloud services.\n\n**Parallel Processing**: Leverage parallel processing techniques and distributed computing frameworks to improve throughput and performance.\n\n**Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize infrastructure configurations, minimize data movement through virtualization techniques when appropriate.\n\n### **Flexibility & Future-Proofing**\n\n**Extensibility**: Choose frameworks with plugin architectures for connectors, functions, and destinations. Support polyglot environments (Python, Java, SQL) and adhere to standards like OpenLineage, Delta Lake, Iceberg, and dbt compatibility.\n\n**Automation**: Embrace automation to minimize manual intervention and human error. Implement workflow management tools to orchestrate and monitor ETL processes automatically.\n\n**Data Retention**: Retain raw data in staged areas for recovery purposes, define clear retention policies, and use archiving strategies to balance storage costs with accessibility.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nIn 2025, ETL frameworks are **strategic enablers** that go beyond data movement to embed governance, observability, and flexibility. Modern architectures increasingly adopt real-time processing, microservices patterns, and comprehensive metadata management to support both current analytics needs and future AI/ML initiatives.\n\n## Sources:\n- [ETL Best Practices - Peliqan](https://peliqan.io/blog/etl-best-practices/)\n- [ETL Frameworks in 2025 for Future-Proof Data Pipelines | Integrate.io](https://www.integrate.io/blog/etl-frameworks-in-2025-designing-robust-future-proof-data-pipelines/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025.","timestamp":45980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FXXbHGaVaVAcXW2phijTbF","status":"completed","timestamp":45980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from some of these recent sources.","timestamp":45980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LeJBmH5H3wR3v1jjhfeSV6","status":"completed","timestamp":45980},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch content from some of the most recent and relevant sources from the search results.","timestamp":45980},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45980},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01F5Aqu5kkLCugxse85Jynif","status":"completed","timestamp":45980},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest information from October 2025 sources, here are the key best practices for ETL data pipelines:\n\n## Modern ETL Best Practices (October 2025)\n\n### **Architecture & Design Patterns**\n\n**Hybrid Processing Models**: Modern ETL frameworks support both batch and real-time stream processing within the same framework (e.g., Apache Beam), with exactly-once semantics for transactional pipelines.\n\n**Microservices Architecture**: Build ETL pipelines using modular, microservices-based design where each stage (extract, transform, load) can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Tools like Great Expectations can be integrated natively.\n\n**Metadata Management & Lineage Tracking**: Implement end-to-end lineage tracking from raw source to final report, enable impact analysis, and use unified metadata repositories (DataHub, Amundsen).\n\n**Comprehensive Logging**: Maintain detailed logs capturing information about data sources, transformations, and errors. Use structured logging and log aggregation tools for centralized analysis.\n\n### **Modern Operational Practices**\n\n**Version Control & CI/CD**: Treat ETL logic like application code—version control with Git, make it testable and modular, and deploy using CI/CD pipelines across dev/stage/prod environments.\n\n**Advanced Orchestration**: Use modern orchestration tools (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect) that support dynamic DAGs, retries, SLA enforcement, event- and time-based triggers, and workflow versioning.\n\n**Leverage Cloud Data Warehouse Power**: Implement ELT patterns where appropriate to utilize cloud processing capabilities for complex transformations and take advantage of cloud-native services.\n\n### **Security & Compliance**\n\n- Implement encryption at rest and in motion\n- Apply field-level access control for sensitive data (PII)\n- Maintain immutable audit logs and lineage\n- Establish change management processes for pipeline modifications\n\n### **Monitoring & Optimization**\n\n**Comprehensive Observability**: Track metrics like latency, throughput, and failure rates. Set up custom alerts and provide pipeline-level cost breakdowns, especially for cloud services.\n\n**Parallel Processing**: Leverage parallel processing techniques and distributed computing frameworks to improve throughput and performance.\n\n**Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize infrastructure configurations, minimize data movement through virtualization techniques when appropriate.\n\n### **Flexibility & Future-Proofing**\n\n**Extensibility**: Choose frameworks with plugin architectures for connectors, functions, and destinations. Support polyglot environments (Python, Java, SQL) and adhere to standards like OpenLineage, Delta Lake, Iceberg, and dbt compatibility.\n\n**Automation**: Embrace automation to minimize manual intervention and human error. Implement workflow management tools to orchestrate and monitor ETL processes automatically.\n\n**Data Retention**: Retain raw data in staged areas for recovery purposes, define clear retention policies, and use archiving strategies to balance storage costs with accessibility.\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nIn 2025, ETL frameworks are **strategic enablers** that go beyond data movement to embed governance, observability, and flexibility. Modern architectures increasingly adopt real-time processing, microservices patterns, and comprehensive metadata management to support both current analytics needs and future AI/ML initiatives.\n\n## Sources:\n- [ETL Best Practices - Peliqan](https://peliqan.io/blog/etl-best-practices/)\n- [ETL Frameworks in 2025 for Future-Proof Data Pipelines | Integrate.io](https://www.integrate.io/blog/etl-frameworks-in-2025-designing-robust-future-proof-data-pipelines/)","timestamp":45980}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Data_Engineering","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769688624663,"end":1769688670643,"firstResponse":45980,"sessionCreation":0,"total":45980},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Managing tfsec Exceptions\n\n### Inline Exception Comments\n\nThe primary method for managing tfsec exceptions is using inline comments in your Terraform code:\n\n```hcl\n# Single check ignore\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  # Logging intentionally disabled for cost reasons\n  bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n}\n\n# Multiple checks ignore\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-ec2-require-vpc-flow-logs-for-all-vpcs\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"main\" {\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration File Method (.tfsec.yaml)\n\nCreate a `.tfsec.yaml` file in your project root for centralized exception management:\n\n```yaml\nseverity-overrides:\n  AWS017: LOW  # Downgrade severity instead of ignoring\n  \nexclude-checks:\n  - AWS002    # Globally exclude specific checks\n  - AWS145\n\nexclude:\n  - .terraform/**  # Exclude directories\n  - modules/legacy/**\n\nminimum-severity: HIGH  # Only report HIGH and CRITICAL findings\n```\n\n### Best Practices for tfsec Exceptions\n\n1. **Always document why** - Add comments explaining the business justification\n2. **Use check IDs precisely** - Reference specific check codes (e.g., `aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging`)\n3. **Start with high severity** - Run `tfsec . --minimum-severity HIGH` initially\n4. **Review regularly** - Schedule quarterly reviews of all exceptions\n5. **Version control** - Commit `.tfsec.yaml` to track baseline changes\n\n---\n\n## 2. Managing Checkov Exceptions\n\n### Inline Suppression\n\nCheckov supports inline comments similar to tfsec:\n\n```hcl\n# Single check suppression\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"data\" {\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:Logging disabled for cost optimization\n  bucket = \"data-bucket\"\n}\n\n# Multiple checks\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"logs\" {\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Access logging creates circular dependency\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_21:Versioning not required for log bucket\n  bucket = \"log-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration File (checkov.yml or .checkov.yaml)\n\nCreate a baseline configuration file:\n\n```yaml\nframework:\n  - terraform\n  \nskip-check:\n  - CKV_AWS_20   # S3 bucket logging\n  - CKV_AWS_145  # S3 encryption\n\nskip-path:\n  - .terraform/\n  - modules/legacy/\n  - test/fixtures/\n\nsoft-fail: false  # Set to true for warning-only mode\n\noutput: json  # Options: cli, json, junitxml, github_failed_only\n\ncompact: true\n\nquiet: false\n```\n\n### Baseline File Method\n\nGenerate a baseline from current state to track improvements:\n\n```bash\n# Generate baseline file\ncheckov -d . --create-baseline\n\n# Run against baseline (only new violations fail)\ncheckov -d . --baseline checkov_baseline.json\n```\n\nThis creates a `checkov_baseline.json` file containing all current violations. Future scans will only fail on *new* violations, allowing you to improve security incrementally.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Production-Ready Exception Management Strategy\n\n### Establish a Governance Process\n\n```yaml\n# exception-policy.yaml (organizational standard)\napproval_levels:\n  CRITICAL:\n    required_approvers: 2\n    expiry_days: 30\n    requires_documentation: true\n    \n  HIGH:\n    required_approvers: 1\n    expiry_days: 90\n    requires_documentation: true\n    \n  MEDIUM:\n    required_approvers: 1\n    expiry_days: 180\n    requires_documentation: false\n    \n  LOW:\n    required_approvers: 0\n    expiry_days: 365\n    requires_documentation: false\n```\n\n### Exception Documentation Template\n\nWhen adding exceptions, include:\n\n```hcl\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging\n#checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20\n# EXCEPTION DETAILS:\n# Severity: MEDIUM\n# Approved by: Security Team (JIRA-1234)\n# Justification: Cost optimization - bucket receives 500GB/day logs\n# Alternative controls: CloudTrail enabled for audit trail\n# Expiry: 2026-06-30\n# Review owner: platform-team@company.com\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"high_volume_logs\" {\n  bucket = \"high-volume-application-logs\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. CI/CD Integration for Exception Management\n\n### GitHub Actions Example\n\n```yaml\nname: Terraform Security Scan\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - 'terraform/**'\n\njobs:\n  security-scan:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Run tfsec\n        uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.3\n        with:\n          working_directory: terraform\n          soft_fail: false\n          format: sarif\n          additional_args: --minimum-severity HIGH\n\n      - name: Run Checkov\n        run: |\n          pip install checkov\n          checkov -d terraform \\\n            --config-file .checkov.yaml \\\n            --baseline checkov_baseline.json \\\n            --output cli \\\n            --output json \\\n            --output-file-path checkov-results.json\n\n      - name: Upload results\n        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          sarif_file: tfsec-results.sarif\n```\n\n### Exception Audit Workflow\n\n```yaml\nname: Security Exception Audit\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 9 * * MON'  # Every Monday at 9am\n\njobs:\n  audit-exceptions:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Scan for expired exceptions\n        run: |\n          # Custom script to parse exception comments\n          # and check expiry dates\n          python scripts/audit-exceptions.py\n          \n      - name: Create issue for expired exceptions\n        if: failure()\n        uses: actions/github-script@v7\n        with:\n          script: |\n            github.rest.issues.create({\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              title: 'Security Exception Audit Failed',\n              body: 'Expired security exceptions detected. Review required.',\n              labels: ['security', 'compliance']\n            })\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Migration Strategy for Existing Infrastructure\n\n### Phase 1: Establish Baseline (Week 1-2)\n\n```bash\n# Run full scan and document current state\ntfsec . --format json > baseline-tfsec.json\ncheckov -d . --create-baseline\n\n# Count violations by severity\njq '.results[] | .severity' baseline-tfsec.json | sort | uniq -c\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Address Critical/High (Week 3-8)\n\n```yaml\n# .tfsec.yaml - Temporary configuration\nminimum-severity: HIGH\n\nexclude-checks:\n  # Document all MEDIUM/LOW exceptions\n  # with justification and target fix date\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Incremental Improvement (Ongoing)\n\n```bash\n# Monthly review: Reduce exceptions by 10%\n# Track metrics:\n- Total violations\n- Violations by severity\n- Exception count\n- Exception age\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommended Tools Comparison for 2026\n\n| Feature | tfsec | Checkov | Notes |\n|---------|-------|---------|-------|\n| **Inline exceptions** | ✅ | ✅ | Both support check-specific ignores |\n| **Config file** | ✅ `.tfsec.yaml` | ✅ `.checkov.yaml` | Centralized management |\n| **Baseline mode** | ❌ | ✅ | Checkov has built-in baseline support |\n| **Severity filtering** | ✅ | ✅ | Focus on high-impact issues first |\n| **CI/CD integration** | ✅ | ✅ | Both have GitHub Actions |\n| **Policy as code** | Limited | ✅ | Checkov integrates with custom policies |\n| **Multi-framework** | Terraform-only | Multi (K8s, Docker, etc.) | Checkov more versatile |\n\n**Note:** As of 2026, tfsec has been merged into **Trivy**, so consider migrating to Trivy for long-term support:\n\n```bash\n# Trivy includes tfsec checks\ntrivy config ./infrastructure/terraform --severity HIGH,CRITICAL\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7.
