OCR2SEQ - Multi-Modal Data Augmentation**\nA novel approach published in 2024 that uses multi-modal generative augmentation to overcome traditional OCR limitations. It simulates realistic text extraction errors and generates diverse data scenarios, particularly effective for sequence-to-sequence models with sparse character sets and specialized vocabularies.\n\n**2. Transformer-Based OCR with Generative Augmentation**\nRecent research (December 2024) implemented **ScrabbleGAN**, a generative deep learning model that creates synthetic training images by replicating fonts from original documents to address data scarcity issues in engineering document recognition.\n\n**3. TextImage Augmentation for Document Images**\nA new technique developed with Albumentations AI that ensures text and image interact throughout model training. The augmentation is applied to both modalities simultaneously, producing datasets with semantically similar textual content and visually distorted images to maintain the text-image relationship.\n\n**4. Text Similarity Measurement in OCR**\nCurrent OCR benchmarks use **Cosine Similarity** scores with the **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** framework to measure text extraction accuracy. The cosine distance formulation calculates similarity between extracted and ground truth texts.\n\n**5. Scene Text Recognition (STR) Augmentation**\nSTRAug offers 36 specialized data augmentation functions organized into 8 groups, recognizing that text recognition requires different augmentation strategies than object recognition tasks.\n\n## Key Trends\n- Shift toward **generative models** for synthetic data creation\n- Emphasis on **multi-modal approaches** that preserve text-image interactions\n- Use of **transformer-based architectures** for OCR tasks\n- **Semantic similarity metrics** (cosine distance, SBERT) for accuracy evaluation\n\nSources:\n- [Leveraging Transformer-Based OCR Model with Generative Data Augmentation](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/1/5)\n- [Introducing TextImage Augmentation for Document Images](https://huggingface.co/blog/doc_aug_hf_alb)\n- [Advancing machine learning with OCR2SEQ](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-024-00927-4)\n- [OCR Benchmark: Text Extraction Accuracy](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/)\n- [Data Augmentation for Scene Text Recognition](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/ILDAV/papers/Atienza_Data_Augmentation_for_Scene_Text_Recognition_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf)\n- [GitHub - mindee/doctr](https://github.com/mindee/doctr)\n- [GitHub - roatienza/straug](https://github.com/roatienza/straug)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about document image augmentation for OCR and text similarity from 2024.","timestamp":36226},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":36226},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WGweFLciyLWYvR3vmjysjv","status":"completed","timestamp":36226},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here are the key developments in document image augmentation for OCR and text similarity from 2024:\n\n## Key Research & Techniques (2024)\n\n**1.
