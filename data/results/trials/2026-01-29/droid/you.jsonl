While tfsec remains available as a standalone CLI, all new development happens in Trivy. Consider migrating to Trivy for long-term support.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Checkov Exception Management\n\n### A. Inline Suppression (Per-Resource)\n\nAdd comments inside resource blocks:\n\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:The bucket is a public static content host\n  bucket = \"public-assets\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n}\n```\n\n**Format:** `checkov:skip=<check_id>:<suppression_comment>`\n\n### B. Baseline Management for Legacy Code\n\nCreate a baseline to track known issues and only fail on new ones:\n\n```bash\n# Create baseline file (run once on existing codebase)\ncheckov -d . --create-baseline\n\n# Run scans against baseline (only new issues fail)\ncheckov -d . --baseline .checkov.baseline\n```\n\n### C. Configuration File (`.checkov.yaml`)\n\n```yaml\n# .checkov.yaml\nskip-check:\n  - CKV_AWS_20\n  - CKV_AWS_57\n  - CKV2_AWS_*  # Wildcards supported\n\ncheck:\n  - MEDIUM  # Only run MEDIUM+ severity (requires API key)\n\nsoft-fail: false\n\nframework:\n  - terraform\n```\n\n### D.

Production Best Practices for Checkov\n\n1. **Centralized Policy Repository**: Use `--external-checks-dir` to maintain custom policies\n2. **Gradual Rollout**: Use baselines for legacy code, enforce strict checks on new code\n3. **Approval Workflows**: Require security team approval for inline skips\n4. **Quarterly Reviews**: Document and review all exceptions periodically\n\n---\n\n## 2. tfsec/Trivy Exception Management\n\n### A.

Use a Pie Chart as a Visual Approximation (Not a true Venn)\n```mermaid\npie title Sample Distribution\n    \"Category A\" : 40\n    \"Category B\" : 35\n    \"Overlap\" : 25\n```\n\n### 2. Use a Flowchart to Simulate a Venn Concept\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph \"Set A\"\n        A1[Unique to A]\n    end\n    subgraph \"Overlap\"\n        AB[Shared A & B]\n    end\n    subgraph \"Set B\"\n        B1[Unique to B]\n    end\n    A1 --- AB --- B1\n```\n\n### 3. Use External Tools That Do Support Venn Diagrams\n- **Draw.io/diagrams.net** - Free, supports Venn diagrams\n- **Lucidchart** - Has Venn diagram templates\n- **PlantUML** - Also doesn't have native Venn but has workarounds\n- **Python libraries** (matplotlib-venn) - For programmatic generation\n\n### 4. Proposed Syntax (From Community Discussions)\nThe community has suggested syntax like this for future implementation:\n```\nvenn\n    title \"My Venn Diagram\"\n    A[\"Set A\"]\n    B[\"Set B\"]\n    A & B[\"Intersection\"]\n```\n\nHowever, this syntax is **not functional** in Mermaid as of 2026.\n\n## Summary\n\nAs of January 2026, you cannot create a true Venn diagram in Mermaid. The feature has been requested multiple times but remains unimplemented. For Venn diagrams, you'll need to use alternative diagramming tools like Draw.io, Lucidchart, or programmatic solutions like Python's matplotlib-venn library.","timestamp":17821}],"duration":17821,"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Despite its simplicity, it matches or surpasses more complex RL approaches on math reasoning benchmarks.\n\n### 5. **Process Reward Models (PRMs) vs Outcome-Based RL**\n- **Outcome-based RL**: Rewards models for generating correct final answers (even when intermediate steps aren't supervised)\n- **PRMs**: Judge the LLM's explanations during training, though DeepSeek-R1's findings suggest PRMs provide limited advantages compared to the computational overhead they introduce\n\n### 6. **Key Data Selection Strategies (2024)**\n- **Synthetic data generation** for training pipelines\n- **Optimizing data mixes** with domain-specific data\n- **Dedicated long-context training stages**\n- **Curriculum learning** approaches for RL domains\n\n### 7. **Inference-Time Scaling**\nA major trend where models generate extended reasoning chains at test time to improve response quality, enabling \"slow thinking\" approaches that significantly boost performance on complex tasks.\n\n### 8. **Normalization Debate**\nActive research area with conflicting approaches:\n- **GRPO/RLOO**: Advocate group-level normalization for intra-context competition\n- **REINFORCE++**: Argues batch-level normalization prevents reward hacking and improves generalization\n\n### Notable Models Using These Techniques (2024-2025):\n- DeepSeek-R1/R1-Zero\n- OpenAI o1, o3, GPT-5\n- Claude 3.7/4 (Anthropic)\n- Kimi K1.5\n- Qwen 3/QwQ-32B\n\nThese techniques have enabled significant improvements on benchmarks like AIME 2024, Codeforces, and SWE-bench, with models now capable of completing tasks that take humans multiple hours.","timestamp":24006}],"duration":24006,"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Easy to Hard)**\nEmerging technique in 2025:\n- Structures training data from **trivial → easy → medium → hard** tasks\n- Helps LLMs acquire core skills before tackling complex reasoning\n- Addresses the **sparse reward problem** where difficult tasks provide little learning signal\n- Particularly effective for small LLMs (1.5B-3B parameters)\n\n### 5. **RLOO (REINFORCE Leave One Out)**\nAlternative to GRPO with similar data selection philosophy:\n- Uses the mean reward of other responses from identical prompts as a baseline\n- Reduces variance in advantage estimation compared to vanilla REINFORCE\n\n### 6. **Process Reward Models (PRMs) vs. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs)**\nTwo approaches to selecting/weighting training data:\n- **ORMs**: Reward only the final answer correctness (dominant in RLVR)\n- **PRMs**: Attempt to judge intermediate reasoning steps—though DeepSeek-R1 found limited benefit compared to computational overhead\n\n### 7. **Synthetic Data and Domain-Specific Data Mixing**\nIn 2024, major labs focused on:\n- **Optimizing data mixes** for pre-training pipelines\n- Using **synthetic data** generated by models themselves\n- Adding **domain-specific data** (math, code) for targeted reasoning improvement\n\n### 8. **RLPT (Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data)**\nA 2025 paradigm addressing data scarcity:\n- Applies RL directly on unlabeled pre-training data\n- Uses next-segment prediction as a self-supervised task\n- Enables training-time scaling without requiring labeled reasoning datasets\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Technique | Year | Key Innovation |\n|-----------|------|----------------|\n| RLVR | 2024-25 | Verifiable rewards, no human labels |\n| GRPO | 2024 | Group-relative advantages, no critic model |\n| DAPO | 2025 | Dynamic sampling, decoupled clipping |\n| Curriculum RL (E2H) | 2025 | Easy-to-hard task scheduling |\n| RLOO | 2024 | Leave-one-out baseline for variance reduction |\n| RLPT | 2025 | RL on unlabeled pre-training data |\n\nThese techniques collectively represent a shift toward **self-supervised, scalable data selection** that relies on verifiable correctness signals rather than expensive human annotations.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?","timestamp":33986},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":33986},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VmXXHbJZiw3n1n6yEgsBdz","status":"completed","timestamp":33986},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015JN7Q44WmKXyi1wJJhbJyG","status":"completed","timestamp":33986},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XQwWBhJaKfpNeiWU7iM3M5","status":"completed","timestamp":33986},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive overview of the **latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025**:\n\n---\n\n## Key Data Selection Techniques for LLM Reasoning with RL (2024-2025)\n\n### 1. **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**\nThe dominant paradigm that emerged in 2024-2025, pioneered by **DeepSeek-R1** and **OpenAI o1**:\n- Uses **automatically verifiable reward signals** (e.g., correct math answers, passing code tests) rather than human annotations\n- Rewards the model only when the final answer is verifiable as correct\n- Removes the need for human-labeled training data for reasoning tasks\n\n### 2. **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**\nIntroduced in **DeepSeekMath (2024)** and used in DeepSeek-R1:\n- Generates multiple responses (8-64) per prompt and computes advantages *relative to the group*\n- Eliminates the need for a separate critic/value model, reducing memory overhead\n- Data selection happens implicitly through group-level comparison—responses are weighted by their relative quality within each batch\n\n### 3. **DAPO (Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization)**\nReleased by ByteDance in early 2025 as an improvement over GRPO:\n- **Dynamic Sampling**: Filters out prompts where all responses are either all-correct or all-incorrect (uninformative for learning)\n- **Decoupled Clipping**: Separate clipping for positive and negative advantages to prevent entropy collapse\n- **Token-Level Loss**: Addresses long-sequence bias by computing loss at the token level rather than sample level\n- Achieved 50 points on AIME 2024 (vs. DeepSeek-R1's 47)\n\n### 4. **Curriculum Learning for RL (E2H -

Browser Binding Pattern (Playwright Integration)\nCloudflare now supports browser bindings for AI-driven automation:\n```toml\ncompatibility_date = \"2025-09-15\"\ncompatibility_flags = [\"nodejs_compat\"]\nbrowser = { binding = \"MYBROWSER\" }\n```\nThis enables Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol), letting AI agents via Workers AI operate browsers programmatically.\n\n## 5. AI Gateway Integration Pattern\nCombine Workers AI with AI Gateway for:\n- **Caching**: Reduces repeated calls to upstream models\n- **Rate limiting**: Controls traffic flow\n- **Unified billing**: Pay for third-party model usage (OpenAI, etc.) directly through Cloudflare (new for 2026)\n- **Analytics**: Token tracking and usage observability\n\n## 6. Automatic Tracing Pattern\nWorker bindings like KV, R2, and Durable Objects are automatically traced. Each operation generates a span containing attributes such as operation type, error if applicable, object key, and duration. (Note: Tracing charges began January 15, 2026)\n\n## 7. REST API Endpoint Pattern\nCall Workers AI models via REST API:\n```\nhttps://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/ai/v1\n```\nOr through AI Gateway:\n```\nhttps://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway>/workers-ai/v1\n```\n\nThese patterns reflect the 2026 ecosystem where Workers AI bindings integrate tightly with Cloudflare's broader stack including caching, observability, browser automation, and multi-provider AI routing.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","timestamp":17409},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":17409},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016F7bMd5H8NvBu9TiGD3z5Q","status":"completed","timestamp":17409},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here are some examples of **Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026**:\n\n## 1.

Complete Guide\n\n### Prerequisites\n- **Node.js** v18+\n- **pnpm** v10+ (recommended package manager)\n- **TypeScript** v5+\n- **Tailwind CSS** v4+\n- **Next.js** v16+ (or other supported frameworks)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create Your Turborepo Project\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\nThis creates a monorepo with:\n- `apps/` - Your applications (web, docs)\n- `packages/` - Shared packages (ui, eslint-config, typescript-config, tailwind-config)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Configure the UI Package\n\nNavigate to `packages/ui` and set up the structure:\n\n```\npackages/ui/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   └── ui/           # shadcn components go here\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts      # cn() utility function\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   └── styles/\n│       └── globals.css   # Tailwind CSS imports\n├── components.json        # shadcn configuration\n├── package.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── tsup.config.ts        # Build configuration\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Configure `tsconfig.json` in `packages/ui`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Create `components.json` in `packages/ui`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Create the `cn()` Utility Function\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Install Required Dependencies\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Configure TSUP for Building\n\nCreate `packages/ui/tsup.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles/globals.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Configure Package Exports\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./styles.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/*.mjs\",\n    \"./components/ui/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/ui/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/tsup/lib/*.mjs\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./dist/tsup/hooks/*.mjs\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsup\",\n    \"dev\": \"tsup --watch\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Add shadcn Components\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Configure Your App to Use the UI Package\n\nIn `apps/web/package.json`, ensure the dependency:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@workspace/ui\": \"workspace:*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nImport styles in your app's CSS file (`apps/web/app/globals.css`):\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Use Components in Your App\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/ui/button\";\nimport { Card } from \"@workspace/ui/components/ui/card\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Architecture Summary\n\n| Aspect | Implementation |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Package Manager** | pnpm workspaces |\n| **Task Runner** | Turborepo |\n| **Module System** | Package `exports` field |\n| **Build Tool** | TSUP (not tsc) - critical for alias resolution |\n| **Styling** | Tailwind v4 with CSS variables |\n| **CLI Config** | Multiple `components.json` (one per package) |\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n1. **\"Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'\"** - Ensure tsup is configured with the correct tsconfig.json path\n2. **\"Module not found '@workspace/ui/components/button'\"** - Run `pnpm build` in packages/ui and verify exports in package.json\n3. **Styling issues** -

Your applications (web, docs)\n- `packages/` - Shared packages (ui, eslint-config, typescript-config, tailwind-config)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Configure the UI Package\n\nNavigate to `packages/ui` and set up the structure:\n\n```\npackages/ui/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   └── ui/           # shadcn components go here\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts      # cn() utility function\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   └── styles/\n│       └── globals.css   # Tailwind CSS imports\n├── components.json        # shadcn configuration\n├── package.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── tsup.config.ts        # Build configuration\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Configure `tsconfig.json` in `packages/ui`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Create `components.json` in `packages/ui`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Create the `cn()` Utility Function\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Install Required Dependencies\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Configure TSUP for Building\n\nCreate `packages/ui/tsup.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles/globals.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Configure Package Exports\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./styles.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/*.mjs\",\n    \"./components/ui/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/ui/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/tsup/lib/*.mjs\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./dist/tsup/hooks/*.mjs\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsup\",\n    \"dev\": \"tsup --watch\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Add shadcn Components\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Configure Your App to Use the UI Package\n\nIn `apps/web/package.json`, ensure the dependency:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@workspace/ui\": \"workspace:*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nImport styles in your app's CSS file (`apps/web/app/globals.css`):\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Use Components in Your App\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/ui/button\";\nimport { Card } from \"@workspace/ui/components/ui/card\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Architecture Summary\n\n| Aspect | Implementation |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Package Manager** | pnpm workspaces |\n| **Task Runner** | Turborepo |\n| **Module System** | Package `exports` field |\n| **Build Tool** | TSUP (not tsc) - critical for alias resolution |\n| **Styling** | Tailwind v4 with CSS variables |\n| **CLI Config** | Multiple `components.json` (one per package) |\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n1. **\"Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'\"** - Ensure tsup is configured with the correct tsconfig.json path\n2. **\"Module not found '@workspace/ui/components/button'\"** - Run `pnpm build` in packages/ui and verify exports in package.json\n3. **Styling issues** - Ensure `@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\"` is in your app's CSS\n\n---\n\n### Official Template\n\nshadcn/ui provides an official monorepo-next template you can reference:\n- Uses pnpm workspaces + Turborepo\n- Tailwind v4 with CSS-first configuration\n- Centralized `@workspace/ui` package pattern","timestamp":39022}],"duration":39022,"pass":true,"score":0.97,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial\nNow let me get more detailed content from one of the most comprehensive and recent guides:\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo** (current best practices):\n\n---\n\n## How to Set Up shadcn UI in a Turborepo Monorepo (2025-2026)\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Turborepo\n\n```bash\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n# or with Tailwind pre-installed:\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Tailwind CSS v4 in `packages/ui`\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\nnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\nCreate `packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n\n### Step 3: Install shadcn Dependencies (Manual Setup Required)\n\nThe shadcn CLI doesn't work directly in a non-framework package, so install manually:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\nnpm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\n```\n\n### Step 4: Configure Path Aliases\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\", \"dist\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Add the `cn` Utility Function\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { clsx, type ClassValue } from \"clsx\"\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\"\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Configure Global Styles\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` with theme variables:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"tw-animate-css\";\n\n@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));\n\n:root {\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n  --primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);\n  /* ... add all theme variables ... */\n  --radius: 0.625rem;\n}\n\n.dark {\n  --background: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);\n  /* ... dark mode variables ... */\n}\n\n@theme inline {\n  --color-background: var(--background);\n  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);\n  /* ... map CSS variables to Tailwind ... */\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * { @apply border-border outline-ring/50; }\n  body { @apply bg-background text-foreground; }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Create `components.json`\n\nCreate `packages/ui/components.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@repo/ui/components\",\n    \"ui\": \"@repo/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"lib\": \"@repo/ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@repo/ui/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 8: Add shadcn Components\n\nNow you can add components from the `packages/ui` directory:\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\nnpx shadcn@latest add button\n```\n\n### Step 9: Export Files from `packages/ui`\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/package.json` exports:\n```json\n{\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": [\"./src/hooks/*.ts\", \"./src/hooks/*.tsx\"],\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 10: Configure the Next.js App\n\nIn `apps/web`:\n\n1. **Add dependency** in `apps/web/package.json`:\n```json\n{ \"dependencies\": { \"@repo/ui\": \"*\" } }\n```\n\n2. **Create PostCSS config** `apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`:\n```javascript\nexport { default } from \"@repo/ui/postcss.config\";\n```\n\n3. **Add path aliases** to `apps/web/tsconfig.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. **Update Next.js config** `apps/web/next.config.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next';\n\nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: [\"@repo/ui\"],\n};\n\nexport default nextConfig;\n```\n\n5. **Import global styles** in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`:\n```typescript\nimport '@repo/ui/globals.css';\n```\n\n6. **Create app-level `components.json`** in `apps/web/components.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@repo/ui/components\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 11: Use Components\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from '@repo/ui/components/button';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **The shadcn CLI won't auto-detect** the UI package as a framework, so manual setup is required\n- **Use TSUP** for building the UI package if you need to distribute compiled components\n- **Tailwind CSS v4** uses CSS-first configuration with `@import \"tailwindcss\"`\n- **Path aliases** must be configured in both `tsconfig.json` and `components.json`\n- **`transpilePackages`** in Next.js config is essential for symlinked packages","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026

\"@workspace/ui/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Create the `cn()` Utility Function\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Install Required Dependencies\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Configure `tsup.config.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Configure Package Exports in `packages/ui/package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./components/ui/*\": \"./src/components/ui/*.tsx\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsup\",\n    \"dev\": \"tsup --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Set Up Tailwind CSS v4 with `@source` Directive\n\nIn `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"tw-animate-css\";\n\n@source \"../components\";\n@source \"../lib\";\n\n@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));\n\n:root {\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  /* ...other CSS variables */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Add shadcn Components\n\nFrom `packages/ui/`:\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card\n# Add more components as needed\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Configure the Consuming App\n\nIn `apps/web/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"app/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n

\"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn `apps/web/app/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@workspace/ui/globals.css\";\n\n@source \"../../../packages/ui/src\";\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 12: Use Components in Your App\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/ui/button\";\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Button variant=\"outline\" className={cn(\"my-custom-class\")}>\n      Click me\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n| Aspect | Recommendation |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Package Manager** | pnpm with workspaces |\n| **Build Tool** | tsup (resolves path alias issues that tsc has) |\n| **Module Exports** | Use explicit `exports` field in package.json |\n| **Tailwind v4** | Use `@source` directive to include component paths |\n| **components.json** | Keep one in `packages/ui/` and optionally one in each app |\n\n---\n\n### Common Troubleshooting\n\n1. **`Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'`** → Ensure tsup is configured with correct tsconfig.json path\n2. **Module not found errors** → Verify package.json exports match your file structure\n3. **Styling issues** → Make sure `@source` directive includes all component directories\n\nThis setup provides a scalable, maintainable monorepo architecture where shadcn/UI components are shared across multiple applications with proper TypeScript support and hot reloading during development.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026

on my search, here are the **latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025**:\n\n## Core Architecture Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Cloud-Native & Hybrid Architecture**\n- Build cloud-native ETL pipelines on AWS, GCP, or Azure for scalability and cost-effectiveness\n- Implement hybrid models that seamlessly handle both batch and streaming data within the same framework (e.g., Apache Beam)\n- Design for multi-cloud environments with proper governance standards\n\n### 2. **Modern Orchestration**\n- Use modern orchestration tools like **Airflow, Dagster, or Prefect** instead of basic cron jobs\n- Implement support for dynamic DAGs, retries, and SLA enforcement\n- Leverage orchestration tools for both visibility and control over pipelines\n\n### 3. **ELT over ETL for Modern Workloads**\n- Consider ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) as the modern successor for cloud data warehouse environments\n- Transform data within the target system to leverage its compute power\n- Use tools like **dbt** for transformation layer management\n\n## Data Quality & Governance\n\n### 4. **Robust Data Quality Checks**\n- Integrate data quality frameworks like **Great Expectations** or build native validation within ETL logic\n- Implement exactly-once semantics for transactional pipelines using checkpointing and watermarking\n- Organizations following proper ETL best practices report 73% faster time-to-insight and 45% reduction in data-related errors\n\n### 5. **Metadata Management & Lineage**\n- Strong metadata management is critical for governance, auditability, and debugging\n- Track data lineage across all pipeline stages\n- Maintain comprehensive documentation of data flows\n\n### 6. **Version Control & CI/CD**\n- Apply version control to all pipeline code and configurations\n- Implement CI/CD for automated pipeline promotion workflows\n- Expose SDKs and APIs to support full automation of deployments\n\n## Reliability & Scalability\n\n### 7. **Fault Tolerance & Recovery**\n- Design pipelines to handle errors, failures, and unexpected scenarios without disrupting data flow\n- Implement extensive logging and automated recovery mechanisms\n- Set up comprehensive alerting (Slack, email, app notifications) for pipeline failures\n\n### 8. **Scalable Design**\n- Build pipelines that can scale as data volumes grow (data doubles every 2 years)\n- Choose tools known for scalability: **Talend, Informatica, Apache NiFi, AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory**\n- Design modular, microservices-inspired pipeline components\n\n### 9. **Real-Time

These attacks enable:\n- **Web scraping** (stealing pricing/inventory data)\n- **Credential stuffing** and account takeovers\n- **Inventory hoarding** (bots buying limited-edition items)\n- **Fake account creation** and multi-accounting fraud\n- **Ad fraud** and fake reviews\n\n---\n\n### **1. Multi-Layered Detection Techniques**\n\n#### **A. TLS/JA3 Fingerprinting**\nModern anti-bot systems analyze the TLS handshake signature (JA3/JA4 fingerprints) to identify automated tools:\n- Python libraries like `requests` or `curl` have distinct TLS fingerprints different from real browsers\n- Even with residential IPs, bots can be detected by mismatched TLS signatures\n- **Implementation**: Use solutions like Cloudflare Bot Management which combines TLS fingerprinting with behavioral analysis\n\n#### **B. Device Fingerprinting**\nCollect and analyze unique device attributes:\n- **Canvas fingerprinting** - Rendering differences across devices\n- **WebGL fingerprinting** - GPU-based unique identifiers\n- **Audio context fingerprinting** - Audio processing signatures\n- **Browser configuration analysis** - Plugins, fonts, screen resolution, timezone\n\nEven with rotating IPs, the same device fingerprint appearing across different IPs signals bot activity.\n\n#### **C. Behavioral Analysis**\nAI-powered systems analyze user interaction patterns:\n- **Mouse movements** and click patterns\n- **Typing cadence** and keystroke dynamics\n- **Scrolling behavior** and page engagement time\n- **Navigation patterns** and checkout timing\n- **Session velocity** - Request frequency that's unnaturally consistent\n\nBots exhibit machine-like precision that differs from natural human randomness.\n\n#### **D. WebRTC Leak Detection**\nWebRTC can expose real IP addresses even when using proxies. Implement WebRTC leak detection to identify:\n- Mismatches between declared IP and WebRTC-exposed IP\n- Users with WebRTC disabled (suspicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### **2. IP Intelligence & Reputation Systems**\n\n#### **A. ASN (Autonomous System Number) Analysis**\nModern detection systems examine:\n- Traffic from hosting providers vs. legitimate ISPs\n- Known VPN/proxy ASN ranges\n- Datacenter IP ranges (immediate red flag)\n\n#### **B. Residential Proxy Detection**\nEven \"clean\" residential IPs can be detected through:\n- **IP reputation databases** - Historical abuse patterns\n- **Connection characteristics** - TCP/IP fingerprints, latency patterns\n- **Geolocation anomalies** - IP location vs. timezone/language settings\n- **Machine Learning models** - Cloudflare's v8 Bot Management ML model specifically targets residential proxy abuse\n\n#### **C. Proximity Detection**\nNewer technology (like Fingerprint's 2026 release) detects:\n- Multiple accounts from devices in close physical proximity\n- Device farm patterns\n- Coordinated network behavior indicating fraud rings\n\n---\n\n### **3. Real-Time AI/ML-Based Detection**\n\n#### **A. Global Feature Analysis**\nPlatforms like Cloudflare analyze:\n- Inter-request patterns across their global network\n- Aggregated fingerprint statistics\n- Traffic source anomalies per ASN\n\n#### **B. Session Reputation Scoring**\nReal-time risk scoring evaluates:\n- Device fingerprint consistency\n- IP reputation\n- Purchase history patterns\n- Velocity of orders\n- Geographic anomalies\n\n#### **C. Pattern Recognition**\nML models identify:\n- Bot developers' unique fingerprint signatures\n- Sticky vs. rotating proxy usage patterns\n- Coordinated attack patterns across sessions\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommended Defense Stack for E-commerce**\n\n| Layer | Solution | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| **Edge/CDN** | Cloudflare Bot Management, Akamai | First-line automated bot blocking |\n| **Application** | DataDome, HUMAN Security, Arkose Labs | Advanced behavioral detection |\n| **Identity** | Fingerprint, SEON, Group-IB | Device fingerprinting & fraud intelligence |\n| **Checkout** | Risk scoring (Signifyd, NoFraud) | Transaction-level fraud prevention |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Best Practices for Shopee-like Platforms**\n\n1. **Layer defenses** - No single technique works; combine TLS fingerprinting + device fingerprinting + behavioral analysis + IP reputation\n\n2. **Implement rate limiting with smart thresholds** - Consider fingerprint-based limits, not just IP-based\n\n3. **Monitor for anti-detect browser signatures** - Tools like Multilogin, GoLogin, AdsPower leave detectable traces\n\n4. **Deploy CAPTCHA alternatives** - Arkose Labs' MatchKey challenges are resistant to AI solving farms\n\n5. **Use session-based anomaly detection** - Track behavior across entire user sessions, not just individual requests\n\n6. **Maintain real-time threat intelligence feeds** - Keep IP reputation databases current\n\n7. **Enable proximity detection** - Identify device farms and multi-accounting\n\n8. **Implement network fingerprinting** - Analyze TCP/IP stack characteristics beyond just IP addresses\n\n---\n\n### **Key 2026 Trends**\n\n- **AI vs. AI**: Bot operators use AI to mimic human behavior; defenders use AI to detect subtle anomalies\n- **Residential proxy prevalence**: 37% of internet traffic is now malicious bots, many using residential proxies\n- **Unified detection platforms**: Modern solutions combine all signals (behavioral, device, network, IP) into single ML models\n- **Real-time session hijacking prevention**: New focus on protecting against reverse proxy phishing that bypasses MFA\n\nThe most effective 2026 approach combines **Cloudflare/Akamai at the edge**, **behavioral biometrics at the application layer**, and **device fingerprinting for identity verification** - creating a defense-in-depth strategy that remains effective even when attackers rotate IPs constantly.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":45760},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":45760},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013fa3zV8AHj6z1gsBHj1eiq","status":"completed","timestamp":45760},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QnadwEdtLE7skK1TMsK5ua","status":"completed","timestamp":45760},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Gsnw4XnYYJreUG5BYBCmDT","status":"completed","timestamp":45760},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01U9bvDuESPfYqwKegGhKJsc","status":"completed","timestamp":45760},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive research, here's a detailed guide on **detecting and preventing proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## **How to Detect and Prevent Proxy Rotation Attacks in E-commerce Platforms (2026)**\n\n### **Understanding Proxy Rotation Attacks**\nProxy rotation attacks use pools of IP addresses (especially residential proxies) that automatically rotate with each request, making it difficult to track and block malicious actors.

Historical IP behavior\n  - ASN (Autonomous System Number) classification\n  - Geographic consistency\n  - VPN/proxy detection\n  - Time zone mismatches\n\n#### 5. **Proximity Detection (New in 2026)**\n- Fingerprint's new technology identifies device clusters operating in close physical range\n- Helps detect device farms and multi-account fraud operations\n\n### Prevention Strategies\n\n#### 1. **Multi-Layered Authentication**\n- Implement CAPTCHA challenges (hCaptcha, reCAPTCHA Enterprise)\n- Use adaptive MFA that triggers based on risk signals\n- Require app-based login for sensitive operations (like Shopee does)\n\n#### 2. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**\n- Implement intelligent rate limits based on behavior patterns, not just IP\n- Use velocity checks for transaction frequency\n- Apply different thresholds based on device risk scores\n\n#### 3. **Bot Management Platforms**\nTop solutions for 2026 include:\n- **Cloudflare Bot Management**: AI-powered, handles residential proxy detection\n- **Imperva (WAAP)**: Advanced bot management for e-commerce\n- **Arkose Labs**: Adaptive challenges, effective against automation\n- **F5 Cloud Bot Defense**: Uses Shape Security acquisition technology\n\n#### 4. **Session & Cookie Management**\n- Implement persistent session tracking\n- Use cryptographic session tokens that can't be replicated\n- Monitor for session anomalies (multiple geographic locations, device switches)\n\n#### 5. **Real-Time Risk Assessment APIs**\n- Integrate risk scoring into checkout, login, and account creation flows\n- Block high-risk transactions instantly\n- Allow trusted users frictionless experience\n\n### Shopee-Specific Considerations\n\nShopee employs multiple defensive measures:\n- **JavaScript-rendered content**: Defeats simple HTTP scrapers\n- **Aggressive IP rate-limiting**: Instant blocks on excessive requests\n- **Mandatory app-based login + CAPTCHA**: For sensitive operations\n- **Device fingerprinting**: Detects fingerprint-based fraud\n- **Dynamic DOM/API changes**: Frequently updates to break scrapers\n\n### Key Takeaways for 2026\n\n1. **Don't rely solely on IP blocking** - Modern attackers use residential proxies that share IPs with legitimate users\n2. **Combine multiple signals** - Device fingerprinting + behavioral analysis + TLS fingerprinting provides the best detection\n3. **Use AI/ML models** -

E-commerce platforms face threats including:\n- Scraping product data at scale\n- Credential stuffing attacks\n- Fake account creation\n- Inventory hoarding/denial attacks\n- Price manipulation schemes\n\n### Detection Techniques\n\n**1. Multi-Layered Fingerprinting**\n- **Device fingerprinting**: Collect browser configurations, OS, screen resolution, plugins, and hardware attributes\n- **Canvas/WebGL fingerprinting**: Detect inconsistencies between claimed device and actual rendering behavior (e.g., Picasso fingerprinting by DataDome)\n- **TLS/JA3 fingerprinting**: Analyze SSL/TLS handshake patterns that differ between real browsers and automation tools\n- **Font fingerprinting**: Detect OS mismatches through font rendering backends\n\n**2. Behavioral Analysis**\n- **Mouse/touch movement patterns**: Bots exhibit unnaturally linear or programmatic movements\n- **Typing cadence analysis**: Human typing has natural rhythm variations that bots struggle to replicate\n- **Scroll behavior**: Analyze scrolling speed, pauses, and patterns\n- **Session behavior modeling**: Track navigation patterns, page dwell times, and interaction sequences\n- **Time-based anomalies**: Flag unusual activity patterns (e.g., high traffic at 3 AM)\n\n**3. IP/Network Intelligence**\n- **IP reputation scoring**: Use services like IPQS, MaxMind, or IPinfo to detect known proxy/VPN IPs\n- **ASN analysis**: Identify traffic from datacenter ASNs vs residential ISPs\n- **Geolocation consistency**: Detect timezone mismatches between claimed location and browser settings\n- **Connection pattern analysis**: Look for multiple accounts/sessions from the same IP subnet\n\n**4. Machine Learning Models**\n- **Continuous trust scoring**: Instead of binary accept/reject, use real-time risk scores that evolve during sessions\n- **Anomaly detection**: Train models on legitimate user behavior to identify deviations\n- **Graph analysis**: Detect coordinated attacks by analyzing relationships between accounts, IPs, and devices\n- **Self-optimizing models**: Continuously retrain on new fraud patterns without manual rule updates\n\n### Prevention Strategies\n\n**1. Adaptive Rate Limiting**\n- Implement dynamic rate limits based on risk scores rather than static IP-based limits\n- Apply progressive throttling that increases friction for suspicious behavior\n\n**2. Challenge-Response Systems**\n- Deploy CAPTCHAs sparingly—only when risk signals warrant it\n- Use invisible challenges (proof-of-work, JavaScript execution tests) to detect automation\n\n**3. Session Integrity Monitoring**\n- Validate fingerprint consistency throughout sessions\n- Revoke trust if behavior turns suspicious mid-session\n- Implement session binding to prevent session hijacking\n\n**4. Multi-Signal Correlation**\n- Combine server-side signals (HTTP headers, request patterns) with client-side analysis (behavioral, fingerprinting)\n- Cross-reference weak signals to build strong detection—rotating proxies may change IPs but leave other traces\n\n**5. Bot Management Solutions**\nLeading solutions for e-commerce in 2026 include:\n- **DataDome**: Multi-signal detection with behavioral analysis\n- **Akamai Bot Manager**: Behavioral modeling with massive network telemetry\n- **Cloudflare Bot Management**: Fingerprinting + behavior analysis without storing device fingerprints\n- **HUMAN Security**: Intelligent fingerprinting and pattern recognition\n- **Imperva**: Advanced WAAP with API security and bot management\n\n### Shopee-Specific Considerations\n\nShopee employs:\n- JavaScript challenges and browser validation\n- Device fingerprinting with cross-session tracking\n- ML-based behavioral analysis\n- Rate limiting on APIs and critical endpoints\n- Detection of anti-detect browsers (Multilogin, GoLogin, AdsPower)\n\n### Key Takeaways for 2026\n\n1. **No single signal is sufficient**—sophisticated bots spoof individual attributes; detection requires correlating multiple signals\n2. **Move from static rules to continuous trust scoring**—evaluate risk throughout the entire session\n3. **Focus on intent, not just identity**—modern systems analyze behavioral patterns to understand user intent\n4. **Leverage AI/ML defensively**—as attackers use AI to mimic human behavior, defenders must use AI to detect subtle anomalies\n5. **Balance security with UX**—minimize friction for legitimate users while maximizing it for bots","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":36970},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":36970},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01ST1WR8rocnvTu1a28on5bj","status":"completed","timestamp":36970},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VkSgir9iGTudxgBp97GErn","status":"completed","timestamp":36970},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013potkg3TQ3UGgkF6ezzmwb","status":"completed","timestamp":36970},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Ltfy3RAvqzsUQe77K8ubYC","status":"completed","timestamp":36970},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive answer on how to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026:\n\n## Detecting and Preventing Proxy Rotation Attacks in E-Commerce (2026)\n\n### The Challenge\nIn 2026, attackers use sophisticated proxy rotation techniques with residential and mobile IPs, anti-detect browsers, and AI-powered tools to evade traditional security measures.

apps extend behind system bars by default\n- Use `enableEdgeToEdge()` API to simplify backwards-compatibility\n\n### 2. **WindowInsets API for Inset Handling**\n\n**For Jetpack Compose:**\n```kotlin\n// Use built-in modifiers\nModifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.systemBars)\nModifier.navigationBarsPadding()\nModifier.systemBarsPadding()\n\n// Or use Scaffold with contentWindowInsets\nScaffold(\n    contentWindowInsets = WindowInsets.systemBars,\n    content = { innerPadding -> /* content */ }\n)\n```\n\n**For XML Views:**\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n    v.updateLayoutParams<MarginLayoutParams> {\n        leftMargin = insets.left\n        bottomMargin = insets.bottom\n        rightMargin = insets.right\n    }\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Navigation Bar Gesture Insets**\n- **Gesture navigation** uses a smaller bottom inset than **3-button navigation**\n- Use `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.navigationBars()` for navigation bar insets\n- Use `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures()` for gesture-navigational areas that take priority over your app\n- The `navigationBarsPadding()` modifier automatically handles both gesture and button-based navigation\n\n### 4. **Safe Area Considerations**\n- **System bar insets**: Status bar and navigation bar areas\n- **Display cutout insets**: For devices with notches/punch-holes\n- **System gesture insets**: For gesture areas used by the system\n- Always keep interactive content **inside the safe area** to avoid conflicts with system gestures\n\n### 5. **Best Practices**\n- **Avoid double-applying insets** -

apps extend behind system bars by default\n- Use `enableEdgeToEdge()` API to simplify backwards-compatibility\n\n### 2. **WindowInsets API for Inset Handling**\n\n**For Jetpack Compose:**\n```kotlin\n// Use built-in modifiers\nModifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.systemBars)\nModifier.navigationBarsPadding()\nModifier.systemBarsPadding()\n\n// Or use Scaffold with contentWindowInsets\nScaffold(\n    contentWindowInsets = WindowInsets.systemBars,\n    content = { innerPadding -> /* content */ }\n)\n```\n\n**For XML Views:**\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n    v.updateLayoutParams<MarginLayoutParams> {\n        leftMargin = insets.left\n        bottomMargin = insets.bottom\n        rightMargin = insets.right\n    }\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Navigation Bar Gesture Insets**\n- **Gesture navigation** uses a smaller bottom inset than **3-button navigation**\n- Use `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.navigationBars()` for navigation bar insets\n- Use `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures()` for gesture-navigational areas that take priority over your app\n- The `navigationBarsPadding()` modifier automatically handles both gesture and button-based navigation\n\n### 4. **Safe Area Considerations**\n- **System bar insets**: Status bar and navigation bar areas\n- **Display cutout insets**: For devices with notches/punch-holes\n- **System gesture insets**: For gesture areas used by the system\n- Always keep interactive content **inside the safe area** to avoid conflicts with system gestures\n\n### 5. **Best Practices**\n- **Avoid double-applying insets** - use `.consumeWindowInsets()` (Compose) or `WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED` (XML)\n- For scrollable lists, add bottom padding so last items scroll past the navigation bar: `clipToPadding = false`\n- Don't place buttons or tap targets in the gesture navigation zone (bottom ~48dp for gesture nav)\n- `BottomNavigationView` and similar components often auto-apply insets -
