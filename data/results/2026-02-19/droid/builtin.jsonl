VWAP Formula (Volume Weighted Average Price)\n\n**Typical Price Calculation:**\n```\nTypical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3\n```\n\n**VWAP Formula:**\n```\nVWAP = Σ(Typical Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)\n```\n\nOr equivalently:\n```\nVWAP = Cumulative(Typical Price × Volume) / Cumulative(Volume)\n```\n\nThe calculation involves:\n1. Calculate the Typical Price for each period: (High + Low + Close) / 3\n2. Multiply the Typical Price by the Volume for each period\n3. Sum all (Typical Price × Volume) values cumulatively\n4. Sum all Volume values cumulatively\n5. Divide the cumulative (Price × Volume) by cumulative Volume\n\nVWAP resets at the beginning of each trading session.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Candlestick Data Components (OHLC)\n\nCandlestick data consists of **four key price points** for each time period:\n\n| Component | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Open (O)** | The price at which the asset starts trading at the beginning of the time period |\n| **High (H)** | The highest price reached during the period |\n| **Low (L)** | The lowest price recorded during the period |\n| **Close (C)** | The final price at which the asset trades at the end of the period |\n\n**Visual representation:**\n- The **body** (rectangle) represents the range between Open and Close\n- The **wicks/shadows** (lines extending above and below) show the High and Low\n- **Color** indicates direction: typically green/hollow = bullish (Close > Open), red/filled = bearish (Close < Open)","timestamp":26580}],"duration":27467,"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

**Nodes** represent agents, functions, or decision points\n   - **Edges** define data flow and control\n   - This enables parallel execution, conditional branching, and complex workflows\n\n2. **Three Primary Multi-Agent Patterns**:\n   - **Supervisor Architecture**: Centralized model with a main supervisor managing tasks and communication among specialized sub-agents - ideal for structured, sequential workflows\n   - **Swarm Architecture**: Decentralized approach where agents operate autonomously and collaborate based on expertise - suited for dynamic environments like customer service\n   - **Hierarchical Organizations**: Combines centralized oversight with independent agent contributions for complex tasks\n\n3. **Core Components for Multi-Agent Systems**:\n   - **Planners**: Break down goals into actionable steps\n   - **Routers**: Delegate tasks to appropriate specialists\n   - **Specialist Agents**: Handle domain-specific expertise\n   - **Critics/Verifiers**: Assess output quality\n   - **Memory & Checkpointing**: Maintain context and enable system reliability\n\n**Production-Ready Best Practices:**\n\n- **Robust State Management**: Maintain and persist state for recovery and continuity using StateGraph for centralized state sharing\n- **Durability and Checkpointing**: Implement systems that withstand failures and allow resumption from saved states\n- **Structured Conditional Execution**: Support complex decision-making with conditional branching and parallel execution\n- **Observability and Tracing**: Deep monitoring integration for diagnosing issues\n- **Start Simple**: Begin with a single capable agent; add complexity only as needed\n- **Clear Role Definitions**: Establish strict schemas for effective agent communication\n\n### Cybersecurity Applications\n\n**AI Agents in Cybersecurity - Key Applications:**\n\n1. **Threat Detection**: AI agents analyze vast data volumes to identify anomalies more efficiently than traditional methods\n2. **Automated Response**: Autonomous incident response minimizes damage and reduces response times\n3. **Predictive Analytics**: Leverage historical data to forecast threats and proactively strengthen defenses\n\n**Security Best Practices for AI Agents:**\n\n1. **OWASP Top 10 Risks for Agentic AI**: Follow the newly released OWASP GenAI Security Project guidelines covering vulnerabilities specific to AI agents\n\n2. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Essential for AI-related threats -

**Nodes** represent agents, functions, or decision points\n   - **Edges** define data flow and control\n   - This enables parallel execution, conditional branching, and complex workflows\n\n2. **Three Primary Multi-Agent Patterns**:\n   - **Supervisor Architecture**: Centralized model with a main supervisor managing tasks and communication among specialized sub-agents - ideal for structured, sequential workflows\n   - **Swarm Architecture**: Decentralized approach where agents operate autonomously and collaborate based on expertise - suited for dynamic environments like customer service\n   - **Hierarchical Organizations**: Combines centralized oversight with independent agent contributions for complex tasks\n\n3. **Core Components for Multi-Agent Systems**:\n   - **Planners**: Break down goals into actionable steps\n   - **Routers**: Delegate tasks to appropriate specialists\n   - **Specialist Agents**: Handle domain-specific expertise\n   - **Critics/Verifiers**: Assess output quality\n   - **Memory & Checkpointing**: Maintain context and enable system reliability\n\n**Production-Ready Best Practices:**\n\n- **Robust State Management**: Maintain and persist state for recovery and continuity using StateGraph for centralized state sharing\n- **Durability and Checkpointing**: Implement systems that withstand failures and allow resumption from saved states\n- **Structured Conditional Execution**: Support complex decision-making with conditional branching and parallel execution\n- **Observability and Tracing**: Deep monitoring integration for diagnosing issues\n- **Start Simple**: Begin with a single capable agent; add complexity only as needed\n- **Clear Role Definitions**: Establish strict schemas for effective agent communication\n\n### Cybersecurity Applications\n\n**AI Agents in Cybersecurity -

Apply `magnification` (1.1-1.3x) for the center item\n   - Use `surroundingOpacity` (0.3-0.5) to fade non-selected items\n   - Add animated transitions for smooth selection changes\n\n6. **iOS-Style Center Highlight**:\n   ```dart\n   selectionOverlay: Container(\n     decoration: BoxDecoration(\n       border: Border(\n         top: BorderSide(color: Colors.grey.shade300, width: 0.5),\n         bottom: BorderSide(color: Colors.grey.shade300, width: 0.5),\n       ),\n     ),\n   ),\n   ```\n\n7. **Looping/Infinite Scroll**: For cyclical values (like hours), enable looping:\n   ```dart\n   looping: true,\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Package Summary (2026)**\n\n| Package | Horizontal Support | iOS Style | Haptics | Best For |\n|---------|-------------------|-----------|---------|----------|\n| `wheel_picker` | ✅ Native | ✅ | ✅ | General-purpose pickers |\n| `horizontal_slider` | ✅ Native | ✅ | ✅ | Weight/age selectors |\n| `numeric_selector` | ✅ Native | ✅ | ✅ | Form inputs |\n| Custom (RotatedBox) | ✅ Manual | ✅ | Manual | Full control |\n\nThe **`wheel_picker`** package is the most recommended for 2026 due to its active maintenance, comprehensive features, and native horizontal scrolling support without rotation hacks.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I implement a Flutter horizontal scroll number picker with iOS wheel selector style, center highlight, and best practices for 2026?","timestamp":1574},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"Flutter horizontal scroll number picker iOS wheel selector style center highlight 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":4536},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VpU6hUCVsMBPnVRG6FZxjk","status":"completed","timestamp":13486},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FDHXenyj4Tiskh6USdHHzK","status":"completed","timestamp":13486},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KWcLtev6TyC3omV9BDXf3F","status":"completed","timestamp":25051},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HCZT9Hu6EgpkQnTudEWRsD","status":"completed","timestamp":25052},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive research, I can now provide you with a detailed answer on implementing a Flutter horizontal scroll number picker with iOS wheel selector style, center highlight, and best practices for 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Flutter Horizontal Scroll Number Picker with iOS Wheel Selector Style\n\n### Best Approach Options (2026)\n\nThere are **three recommended approaches** for implementing this:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Use `wheel_picker` Package (Recommended)**\n\nThe `wheel_picker` package (v0.2.2+) is the most feature-complete solution with native horizontal support:\n\n```dart\n// pubspec.yaml\ndependencies:\n  wheel_picker: ^0.2.2\n```\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:wheel_picker/wheel_picker.dart';\n\nclass HorizontalNumberPicker extends StatefulWidget {\n  final int minValue;\n  final int maxValue;\n  final int initialValue;\n  final ValueChanged<int> onChanged;\n\n  const HorizontalNumberPicker({\n    super.key,\n    this.minValue = 0,\n    this.maxValue = 100,\n    this.initialValue = 50,\n    required this.onChanged,\n  });\n\n  @override\n  State<HorizontalNumberPicker> createState() => _HorizontalNumberPickerState();\n}\n\nclass _HorizontalNumberPickerState extends State<HorizontalNumberPicker> {\n  late final WheelPickerController _controller;\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    _controller = WheelPickerController(\n      itemCount: widget.maxValue -

For highly customized designs, the rotated `ListWheelScrollView` approach gives you full control over the appearance and behavior.

    child: CupertinoPicker(\n        itemExtent: 40,\n        scrollController: FixedExtentScrollController(initialItem: 50),\n        useMagnifier: true,\n        magnification: 1.2,\n        onSelectedItemChanged: (index) {\n          HapticFeedback.selectionClick();\n          print('Selected: $index');\n        },\n        children: List.generate(100, (i) => Center(child: Text('$i'))),\n      ),\n    ),\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2026 Best Practices Summary\n\n| Practice | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **State Management** | Use `ValueNotifier` or riverpod for efficient updates |\n| **Haptic Feedback** | Always include via `HapticFeedback.selectionClick()` |\n| **Accessibility** | Provide semantic labels and announcements |\n| **Performance** | Use `ListWheelChildBuilderDelegate` for large lists |\n| **Visual Feedback** | Include center highlight with magnification |\n| **Controller Disposal** | Always dispose `FixedExtentScrollController` |\n| **Animation** | Use `FixedExtentScrollPhysics` for snapping behavior |\n| **Cross-platform** | Test on both iOS and Android for consistent UX |\n\n### Recommended Package for 2026\n\nFor most use cases, I recommend **`wheel_picker`** or **`horizontal_slider`** as they:\n- Are actively maintained\n- Support horizontal scrolling natively\n- Include haptic feedback\n- Have efficient state management\n- Support iOS-style center magnification and highlight","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I implement a Flutter horizontal scroll number picker

on my web search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive answer on implementing a Flutter horizontal scroll number picker with iOS wheel selector style and center highlight.\n\n## Flutter Horizontal Scroll Number Picker with iOS Wheel Style (2026 Best Practices)\n\n### Option 1: Use Pre-built Packages (Recommended)\n\nThere are several well-maintained packages available:\n\n#### **1. `wheel_picker` (Most Feature-Rich)**\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  wheel_picker: ^0.2.2\n```\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:wheel_picker/wheel_picker.dart';\n\nWheelPicker(\n  itemCount: 100,\n  builder: (context, index) => Text('$index'),\n  selectedIndexColor: Colors.blue,\n  looping: true,\n  style: WheelPickerStyle(\n    itemExtent: 40,\n    squeeze: 1.0,\n    diameterRatio: 1.5,\n    magnification: 1.2,\n  ),\n  onIndexChanged: (index) => print('Selected: $index'),\n)\n```\n- Supports horizontal scrolling\n- Center highlight with color shader\n- Tap navigation and haptic feedback\n\n#### **2. `horizontal_slider` (Best for Horizontal Layout)**\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  horizontal_slider: ^latest\n```\n\n```dart\nHorizontalPicker(\n  items: List.generate(100, (i) => i),\n  initialValue: 50,\n  onValueChanged: (value) => print('Selected: $value'),\n  selectedTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 32, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),\n  unselectedTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.grey),\n  hapticFeedback: true,\n)\n```\n- Uses rotated `ListWheelScrollView` internally\n- Built-in haptic feedback\n- Efficient `ValueNotifier` updates\n\n#### **3. `numeric_selector` (Feature Complete)**\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  numeric_selector: ^latest\n```\n\n```dart\nHorizontalNumericSelector(\n  minValue: 0,\n  maxValue: 100,\n  step: 1,\n  initialValue: 50,\n  onValueChanged: (value) => print(\"Selected: $value\"),\n  viewPort: 0.3,\n  selectedTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 32, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),\n  unselectedTextStyle: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.grey),\n  backgroundColor: Colors.white,\n  showLabel: true,\n  label: \"Quantity\",\n  showArrows: true,\n  enableVibration: true,\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Custom Implementation with `ListWheelScrollView`\n\nFor a horizontal picker, you need to rotate the vertical `ListWheelScrollView`:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport

products including acknowledgement tracking, version history, and compliance considerations for 2025?\nBased on my comprehensive research, here is a detailed answer to your question about **Terms of Use page requirements for SaaS products in 2025**:\n\n---\n\n## SaaS Terms of Use Page Requirements for 2025\n\n### 1. **Acknowledgement Tracking Requirements**\n\n**Clickwrap Agreement Implementation (Strongly Recommended)**\n- **Affirmative consent required**: Users must take an explicit action (clicking \"I Agree\" button or checking an unchecked checkbox) before accessing services\n- **No pre-checked boxes**: Consent must be voluntary and deliberate\n- **Clear presentation**: Terms must be visibly displayed or linked prominently before the consent action\n- **Mobile optimization**: Consent mechanisms must work across all devices and meet accessibility standards\n\n**Consent Logging Best Practices:**\n- **Record metadata**: Capture IP address, timestamp, user identifier, device information, and exact version of terms accepted\n- **Secure storage**: Maintain immutable, tamper-proof records of all consent events\n- **Real-time logging**: Implement automated systems that capture consent interactions as they happen\n- **Proof of consent**: Must be able to demonstrate that consent was given \"freely, specifically, and unambiguously\" (GDPR requirement)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Version History Requirements**\n\n**Versioning System:**\n- Display \"Last Updated\" and \"Effective Date\" prominently at the top of the Terms of Use page\n- Maintain a publicly accessible archive of previous versions\n- Implement clear version numbering or dating system\n- Document what changed between versions\n\n**Change Notification Requirements:**\n- **30-day advance notice** for material changes (industry standard)\n- Notification methods should include:\n  - Email notifications to registered users\n  - In-app announcements or banners\n  - Blog posts or legal page updates\n  - Clickwrap re-acknowledgement for significant changes\n- Non-material changes may not require notification but should still be documented\n\n**Version Control for Contracts:**\n- Track which version each user accepted\n- Timestamp each acceptance\n- For existing contracts, new terms typically apply only at renewal (per EU Data Act requirements)\n- Allow users to access the version they originally agreed to\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Compliance Considerations for 2025**\n\n**Privacy Regulations (GDPR/CCPA/CPRA/State Laws):**\n- **20+ U.S. states** now have comprehensive privacy laws as of 2025\n- Include clear data handling disclosures (collection, processing, storage, sharing)\n- Define user rights: access, deletion, correction, data portability, opt-out of sale\n- **Explicit consent tracking** for data processing (especially for GDPR)\n- Include Data Processing Agreement (DPA) provisions\n- **Breach notification protocols** (30-day notice requirement in many jurisdictions)\n\n**EU Data Act (Effective September 12, 2025):**\n- New rights for customers to switch providers easily\n- Eliminate barriers to switching with maximum 2-month termination notice\n- Clear written terms regarding data portability and migration\n- Applies to existing contracts, including fixed-term agreements\n- Extraterritorial application to non-EU providers serving EU customers\n\n**Required Disclosures:**\n- AI usage disclosure (if applicable) - required by several state laws\n- Cookie consent with granular category choices\n- Third-party sharing practices\n- Data retention periods\n- Security measures implemented\n\n**Essential Terms of Service Components:**\n\n| Component | Requirement |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **User Rights & Obligations** | Clearly defined acceptable use policies |\n| **Subscription Terms** | Payment, billing cycles, renewal, cancellation policies |\n| **Service Level Agreements** | Performance metrics, uptime commitments, escalation procedures |\n| **Intellectual Property** | Ownership clarification, licensing terms, user-generated content rights |\n| **Liability Limitations** | Disclaimers, indemnification clauses, liability caps |\n| **Dispute Resolution** | Arbitration clauses, governing law, jurisdiction |\n| **Termination** | Conditions, refund policies, data handling post-termination |\n| **DMCA Compliance** | Copyright infringement procedures (if applicable) |\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Audit Trail Requirements**\n\n**What to Document:**\n- Consent timestamp (date and time)\n- User identifier or

on my comprehensive research, here is a detailed answer to your question about **Terms of Use page requirements for SaaS products in 2025**:\n\n---\n\n## SaaS Terms of Use Page Requirements for 2025\n\n### 1. **Acknowledgement Tracking Requirements**\n\n**Clickwrap Agreement Implementation (Strongly Recommended)**\n- **Affirmative consent required**: Users must take an explicit action (clicking \"I Agree\" button or checking an unchecked checkbox) before accessing services\n- **No pre-checked boxes**: Consent must be voluntary and deliberate\n- **Clear presentation**: Terms must be visibly displayed or linked prominently before the consent action\n- **Mobile optimization**: Consent mechanisms must work across all devices and meet accessibility standards\n\n**Consent Logging Best Practices:**\n- **Record metadata**: Capture IP address, timestamp, user identifier, device information, and exact version of terms accepted\n- **Secure storage**: Maintain immutable, tamper-proof records of all consent events\n- **Real-time logging**: Implement automated systems that capture consent interactions as they happen\n- **Proof of consent**: Must be able to demonstrate that consent was given \"freely, specifically, and unambiguously\" (GDPR requirement)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Version History Requirements**\n\n**Versioning System:**\n- Display \"Last Updated\" and \"Effective Date\" prominently at the top of the Terms of Use page\n- Maintain a publicly accessible archive of previous versions\n- Implement clear version numbering or dating system\n- Document what changed between versions\n\n**Change Notification Requirements:**\n- **30-day advance notice** for material changes (industry standard)\n- Notification methods should include:\n  - Email notifications to registered users\n  - In-app announcements or banners\n  - Blog posts or legal page updates\n  - Clickwrap re-acknowledgement for significant changes\n- Non-material changes may not require notification but should still be documented\n\n**Version Control for Contracts:**\n- Track which version each user accepted\n- Timestamp each acceptance\n- For existing contracts, new terms typically apply only at renewal (per EU Data Act requirements)\n- Allow users to access the version they originally agreed to\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Compliance Considerations for 2025**\n\n**Privacy Regulations (GDPR/CCPA/CPRA/State Laws):**\n- **20+ U.S. states** now have comprehensive privacy laws as of 2025\n- Include clear data handling disclosures (collection, processing, storage, sharing)\n- Define user rights: access, deletion, correction, data portability, opt-out of sale\n- **Explicit consent tracking** for data processing (especially for GDPR)\n- Include Data Processing Agreement (DPA) provisions\n- **Breach notification protocols** (30-day notice requirement in many jurisdictions)\n\n**EU Data Act (Effective September 12, 2025):**\n- New rights for customers to switch providers easily\n- Eliminate barriers to switching with maximum 2-month termination notice\n- Clear written terms regarding data portability and migration\n- Applies to existing contracts, including fixed-term agreements\n- Extraterritorial application to non-EU providers serving EU customers\n\n**Required Disclosures:**\n- AI usage disclosure (if applicable) - required by several state laws\n- Cookie consent with granular category choices\n- Third-party sharing practices\n- Data retention periods\n- Security measures implemented\n\n**Essential Terms of Service Components:**\n\n| Component |

| Conditions, refund policies, data handling post-termination |\n| **DMCA Compliance** | Copyright infringement procedures (if applicable) |\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Audit Trail Requirements**\n\n**What to Document:**\n- Consent timestamp (date and time)\n- User identifier or account information\n- IP address and device/browser information\n- Exact version of terms accepted\n- Method of consent (clickwrap, checkbox, etc.)\n- Any subsequent changes or withdrawals of consent\n\n**Legal Justification:**\n- GDPR Article 6 requires documented legal basis for data processing\n- Consent logs protect against audits, penalties, and litigation\n- Records must be available for Data Protection Authority audits\n- Maintain logs for the duration of the business relationship plus applicable statute of limitations\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Best Practices Summary**\n\n1. **Use clickwrap over browsewrap** for legally enforceable consent\n2. **Implement a Consent Management Platform (CMP)** for

Here's how to do it:\n\n### Approach 1: Apply `[FromHeader]` directly on model properties\n\nYou can decorate individual properties of a complex type with the `[FromHeader]` attribute:\n\n```csharp\npublic class RequestMetadata\n{\n    [FromHeader(Name = \"X-Correlation-Id\")]\n    public string CorrelationId { get; set; }\n\n    [FromHeader(Name = \"X-User-Id\")]\n    public string UserId { get; set; }\n\n    [FromHeader(Name = \"Accept-Language\")]\n    public string Language { get; set; }\n}\n\n[ApiController]\n[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\npublic class ProductsController : ControllerBase\n{\n    [HttpGet]\n    public IActionResult GetProducts(RequestMetadata metadata)\n    {\n        // metadata.CorrelationId, metadata.UserId, and metadata.Language\n        // are populated from the respective headers\n        return Ok(new { metadata.CorrelationId, metadata.UserId });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Approach 2: Apply `[FromHeader]` on the action parameter for a complex type\n\nYou can also apply `[FromHeader]` to the entire complex type parameter. In this case, ASP.NET Core will look for headers matching the property names:\n\n```csharp\npublic class UserInfo\n{\n    public string UserId { get; set; }\n    public string UserRole { get; set; }\n}\n\n[ApiController]\n[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\npublic class UsersController : ControllerBase\n{\n    [HttpGet]\n    public IActionResult GetUser([FromHeader] UserInfo userInfo)\n    {\n        // Headers named \"UserId\" and \"UserRole\" will be bound to the properties\n        return Ok(userInfo);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points for 2026 (ASP.NET Core 9/10):\n\n1. **Name Mapping**: Use the `Name` property of `[FromHeader]` to map header names that differ from property names (especially for headers with hyphens like `Accept-Language`):\n   ```csharp\n   [FromHeader(Name = \"Accept-Language\")]\n   public string Language { get; set; }\n   ```\n\n2. **Mixed Binding Sources**: You can combine different binding attributes on different properties of the same model:\n   ```csharp\n   public class MixedRequest\n   {\n       [FromRoute]\n       public int Id { get; set; }\n       \n       [FromQuery]\n       public string Filter { get; set; }\n       \n       [FromHeader(Name = \"X-Api-Key\")]\n       public string ApiKey { get; set; }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Note about `[FromBody]`**: When `[FromBody]` is applied to a complex type parameter, any `[FromHeader]` or other binding source attributes on that type's properties are **ignored**. The input formatter reads only from the body.\n\n4. **ApiController Behavior**: The `[ApiController]` attribute enables automatic model validation - if required headers are missing, a 400 Bad Request is returned automatically.\n\n5. **Custom Model Binders**: For more complex scenarios (like binding multiple headers into a single property), you can create a custom model binder using `IModelBinder` and `IModelBinderProvider`.\n\n### Example with Validation:\n\n```csharp\npublic class AuthenticatedRequest\n{\n    [FromHeader(Name = \"Authorization\")]\n    [Required]\n    public string AuthToken { get; set; }\n\n    [FromHeader(Name = \"X-Request-Id\")]\n    public string RequestId { get; set; }\n}\n\n[ApiController]\n[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\npublic class SecureController : ControllerBase\n{\n    [HttpGet(\"data\")]\n    public IActionResult GetSecureData(AuthenticatedRequest request)\n    {\n        // Model validation happens automatically due to [ApiController]\n        // Returns 400 if Authorization header is missing\n        return Ok(new { Token = request.AuthToken, RequestId = request.RequestId });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach allows clean separation of concerns and makes your API controllers more maintainable by encapsulating header-bound data in reusable model classes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I use ASP.NET Core model binding with FromHeader on complex type properties at the attribute level in an ApiController in 2026?","timestamp":1589},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"ASP.NET Core model binding FromHeader complex type properties attribute level ApiController 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":4421},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013JFJyT4NfcYHAenyUvJzEk","status":"completed","timestamp":11695},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","input":{"url":"https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/how-to-apply-binding-attributes-to-model-properties-in-asp-net-core-web-api/"},"timestamp":15964},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Kx7MP7gjERMH1VuRih5U8L","status":"completed","timestamp":23493},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XMNwkRavGsTscfb5UW36d6","status":"completed","timestamp":23493},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PcQPJ9DpDGAPX7xZGc1Dj6","status":"completed","timestamp":32454},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive answer to your question.\n\n## Using ASP.NET Core Model Binding with FromHeader on Complex Type Properties at the Attribute Level in an ApiController\n\nIn ASP.NET Core, you can use the `[FromHeader]` attribute to bind HTTP request headers to complex type properties at the attribute level in an `ApiController`.

Here's how to do it:\n\n### Method 1: Apply `[FromHeader]` on Each Property (Recommended)\n\nDefine a class with `[FromHeader]` attributes on each property, then use `[FromHeader]` on the parameter in your controller action:\n\n```csharp\n// Model class with [FromHeader] on each property\npublic class HeadersModel\n{\n    [FromHeader]\n    public string City { get; set; }\n\n    [FromHeader]\n    public int TemperatureC { get; set; }\n\n    [FromHeader]\n    public string Description { get; set; }\n    \n    [FromHeader(Name = \"Accept-Language\")]  // Custom header name\n    public string Language { get; set; }\n    \n    [Required]\n    [FromHeader(Name = \"X-Api-Key\")]\n    public string ApiKey { get; set; }\n}\n\n// Controller action\n[ApiController]\n[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\npublic class WeatherController : ControllerBase\n{\n    [HttpPost(\"forecast\")]\n    public IActionResult Post([FromHeader] HeadersModel headers)\n    {\n        // Access headers.City, headers.TemperatureC, etc.\n        return Ok($\"City: {headers.City}, Temp: {headers.TemperatureC}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Method 2: Use `[FromQuery]` on the Parameter with `[FromHeader]` on Properties\n\nThis approach works better with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation and solves validation issues that can occur in some versions:\n\n```csharp\npublic class HeaderParameters\n{\n    [FromHeader]\n    [Required]\n    public string Header1 { get; set; }\n\n    [FromHeader]\n    public string Header2 { get; set; }\n    \n    [FromHeader(Name = \"X-Custom-Header\")]\n    public string CustomHeader { get; set; }\n}\n\n[ApiController]\n[Route(\"api/[controller]\")]\npublic class MyController : ControllerBase\n{\n    [HttpGet(\"headers\")]\n    public ActionResult<string> Get([FromQuery] HeaderParameters parameters = null)\n    {\n        return Ok(parameters);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Method 3: Create a Custom Attribute for Cleaner Code\n\nYou can create a custom attribute to avoid confusion with the `[FromQuery]` workaround:\n\n```csharp\n[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Parameter | AttributeTargets.Property, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true)]\npublic class FromHeaderModelAttribute : Attribute, IBindingSourceMetadata, IModelNameProvider\n{\n    public BindingSource BindingSource => BindingSource.Query;\n    public string Name { get;

set; }\n   ```\n\n3. **Mix binding sources**: You can combine `[FromHeader]`, `[FromQuery]`, `[FromRoute]`, etc. in the same model:\n   ```csharp\n   public class RequestModel\n   {\n       [FromHeader]\n       public string Authorization { get;

When an application copies data to the pasteboard, it can provide multiple representations of the same content simultaneously. The key principle is:\n\n**The source application determines the order of types it writes**, but **the receiving application decides which type to read**.\n\n### How Type Priority Works\n\n1. **Source Application Side**: When writing to the pasteboard, applications use protocols like `NSPasteboardWriting`. The method `writableTypesForPasteboard:` returns an array of UTIs in priority order. The first type in the array is written initially, with others available on demand (lazy data fulfillment).\n\n2. **Receiving Application Side**: When reading from the pasteboard using `readObjectsForClasses:options:`, the receiving app specifies an array of classes **ordered by preference**. The pasteboard returns instances matching the first available class type. For example:\n   - Requesting `[NSAttributedString, NSString]` prefers rich text over plain text\n   - The receiving app controls which format it consumes\n\n3. **The Critical Issue**: Per Apple's documentation, apps *should not* depend on the order of types on the pasteboard, but in practice, **some apps do**. This creates cross-application compatibility challenges.\n\n### Browser and Terminal Considerations\n\n**Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)**:\n- When copying images, there are documented inconsistencies. Chrome exports `public.tiff` before `public.html`, while Firefox does the opposite\n- This affects apps like Pages that rely on type order despite Apple's guidelines\n- Web Clipboard API standardization efforts (W3C Issue #137) are ongoing to address this\n\n**Terminal Applications**:\n- Terminals typically provide text as `public.utf8-plain-text` or `public.utf16-plain-text`\n- When pasting formatted content into terminals, only plain text representations are used\n- The pasteboard may contain HTML, RTF, and plain text simultaneously, but terminals consume only the text UTI\n\n### macOS 16+ Privacy Changes (2025-2026)\n\nRecent macOS versions introduced significant pasteboard privacy protections:\n- Apps now require user permission to access clipboard contents\n- New `detect` methods in `NSPasteboard` allow apps to check data types **without reading the content**, avoiding privacy alerts\n- The `accessBehavior` property controls pasteboard access permissions\n- Developers can use `detectedPatterns(for:)` to identify content types without triggering user notifications\n\n### Common UTI Types on macOS Pasteboard\n\n| UTI | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| `public.utf8-plain-text` | Plain text (UTF-8) |\n| `public.utf16-plain-text` | Plain text (UTF-16) |\n| `public.rtf` | Rich Text Format |\n| `public.html` | HTML markup |\n| `public.tiff` | TIFF images |\n| `public.png` | PNG images |\n| `public.url` | URLs |\n\n### Best Practices for Cross-Application Compatibility\n\n1. **Source apps** should provide multiple representations (rich text, plain text, HTML) to maximize compatibility\n2. **Receiving apps** should use `readObjectsForClasses:options:` with classes ordered by preference\n3. When subclassing `NSTextView` and overriding `readablePasteboardTypes`, explicitly maintain the order (avoid `NSSet` which loses ordering)\n4. Use tools like **Pruneboard** (Raycast extension) to manage/preview clipboard UTI types when debugging compatibility issues\n\n### Summary\n\nThe pasteboard type priority system in macOS 2026 operates on a dual-control model: source apps provide multiple data representations, and receiving apps choose which to consume based on their capabilities and preferences. Cross-application compatibility challenges primarily arise when apps make assumptions about type ordering or when browsers implement different export orders for the same content type.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow does NSPasteboard type priority order work for cross-application compatibility in macOS terminals and browsers in 2026?","timestamp":1796},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"NSPasteboard type priority order cross-application compatibility macOS 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":5074},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EK6qCBEJAH77dkqfgomCNB","status":"completed","timestamp":14549},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SmYFLPQMzyAiTM9DAartGC","status":"completed","timestamp":14550},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PpnJfCaiXGJYSjPyUcpJ47","status":"completed","timestamp":25929},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MGwr2DFgFidCH3o1Kx5Byf","status":"completed","timestamp":25929},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","input":{"url":"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard"},"timestamp":28861},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01V7Yc53oTMpzwowzG2Pmg5Y","status":"completed","timestamp":33491},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013cAt5QNLmAgqVQJLMnNZmw","status":"completed","timestamp":33492},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive research, here's a detailed answer on how NSPasteboard type priority order works for cross-application compatibility in macOS terminals and browsers in 2026:\n\n## NSPasteboard Type Priority Order in macOS (2026)\n\n### Core Mechanism\n\nThe macOS pasteboard (clipboard) uses **Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs)** to identify different data formats.

Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Install Node.js v20+ and create your project\nnpm create next-app@latest my-ai-app\ncd my-ai-app\n\n# Install Vercel AI SDK and providers\nnpm install ai @ai-sdk/openai ollama-ai-provider\n```\n\n**Install Ollama locally:**\n- Download from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)\n- Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2` (or any model you prefer)\n- Start Ollama server (runs at `http://localhost:11434`)\n\n### 2. Environment Variables Setup\n\nCreate a `.env.local` file:\n\n```env\n# AI Provider Selection (options: \"openai\" | \"ollama\")\nAI_PROVIDER=ollama\n\n# OpenAI Configuration (for production/cloud)\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key\n\n# Ollama Configuration (for local development)\nOLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api\nOLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2\n\n# OpenAI model to use in production\nOPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o\n```\n\n### 3. Create a Provider Factory (Environment-Aware Model Routing)\n\nCreate `lib/ai-provider.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nimport { createOllama } from 'ollama-ai-provider';\n\nexport function getAIModel() {\n  const provider = process.env.AI_PROVIDER || 'ollama';\n\n  if (provider === 'openai') {\n    const openai = createOpenAI({\n      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n    });\n    return openai(process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || 'gpt-4o');\n  }\n\n  // Default to Ollama for local development\n  const ollama = createOllama({\n    baseURL: process.env.OLLAMA_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:11434/api',\n  });\n  return ollama(process.env.OLLAMA_MODEL || 'llama3.2');\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Create the API Route Handler\n\nCreate `app/api/chat/route.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { getAIModel } from '@/lib/ai-provider';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: getAIModel(),\n    messages,\n  });\n\n  return result.toDataStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Frontend Chat Component\n\nUpdate `app/page.tsx`:\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useChat } from 'ai/react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex flex-col w-full max-w-md mx-auto p-4\">\n      <div className=\"flex-1 overflow-y-auto\">\n        {messages.map((m) => (\n          <div key={m.id} className=\"mb-4\">\n            <strong>{m.role === 'user' ? 'You: ' : 'AI: '}</strong>\n            {m.content}\n          </div>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n        <input\n          className=\"w-full p-2 border rounded\"\n          value={input}\n          placeholder=\"Say something...\"\n          onChange={handleInputChange}\n        />\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Switching Between Providers\n\n**For local development (Ollama):**\n```env\nAI_PROVIDER=ollama\n```\n\n**For production/testing with OpenAI:**\n```env\nAI_PROVIDER=openai\n```\n\n### 7. Vercel Deployment Configuration\n\nIn your Vercel project settings, set environment variables:\n- `AI_PROVIDER=openai` (for production)\n- `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key`\n- `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o`\n\n### Key Benefits of This Setup\n\n1. **Cost Reduction**: Use free local Ollama during development\n2. **Privacy**: Keep sensitive dev data local\n3. **Consistent API**: Same code works with both providers\n4. **Easy Switching**: Single environment variable toggles providers\n5. **Flexibility**: Test different models without code changes\n\n### Alternative: Using OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint\n\nOllama also supports OpenAI-compatible API format, allowing you to use the OpenAI SDK directly:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nconst provider = process.env.AI_PROVIDER;\n\nconst model = provider === 'openai' \n  ? createOpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })('gpt-4o')\n  : createOpenAI({ \n      baseURL: 'http://localhost:11434/v1',\n      apiKey: 'ollama', // Ollama doesn't need a real key\n    })('llama3.2');\n```\n\nThis approach lets you use the same OpenAI SDK for both providers, simplifying your codebase.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I set up local AI development testing with Vercel environment variables to switch between the OpenAI API and Ollama in 2026?","timestamp":1463},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"Vercel AI SDK local development testing OpenAI Ollama environment variables 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":6288},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Ez8Qc7xhWscsnUd1nPUoLA","status":"completed","timestamp":14291},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01G7Eevg5mP2H6Fh7WCKe5c1","status":"completed","timestamp":14291},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on setting up local AI development testing with Vercel environment variables to switch between OpenAI API and Ollama in 2026:\n\n## Setting Up Local AI Development Testing with Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI + Ollama)\n\n### 1.

making it easy to switch between cloud-based OpenAI API and local Ollama instances using environment variables.\n\n---\n\n### Method 1: Using the Provider Registry (Recommended)\n\nThe Vercel AI SDK

2: Create a Provider Registry\n\nCreate a file `lib/registry.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nimport { createOllama } from 'ollama-ai-provider';\nimport { createProviderRegistry, customProvider } from 'ai';\n\n// Create Ollama provider instance\nconst ollama = createOllama({\n  baseURL: process.env.OLLAMA_BASE_URL ||

Switching\n\nCreate a utility file `lib/ai-provider.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nimport { createOllama } from 'ollama-ai-provider';\n\nconst ollama = createOllama({\n  baseURL: process.env.OLLAMA_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:11434/api',\n});\n\nexport function getModel() {\n  const provider = process.env.AI_PROVIDER || 'openai';\n  const modelId =

Variables\n\n**For local development (`.env.local`):**\n```bash\n# Use Ollama locally (no API costs)\nAI_PROVIDER=ollama\nAI_MODEL_ID=llama3.2\nOLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api\n```\n\n**For production/cloud (Vercel Dashboard or `.env.production`):**\n```bash\n# Use OpenAI in production\nAI_PROVIDER=openai\nAI_MODEL_ID=gpt-4o\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Use in Your API Route\n\n```typescript\n// app/api/chat/route.ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { getModel } from '@/lib/ai-provider';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const {

// Uses OPENAI_API_KEY from environment\n}\n```\n\n**Environment variables:**\n```bash\n# Local development\nUSE_LOCAL_AI=true\n\n# Production\nUSE_LOCAL_AI=false\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key\n```\n\n---\n\n### Method 3: Using Custom Providers with Model Aliases\n\nFor more control, use custom providers with semantic aliases:\n\n```typescript\nimport { customProvider, gateway } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nimport { createOllama } from 'ollama-ai-provider';\n\nconst ollama =

optimization for incremental builds and dependency checking to achieve faster linking in 2026?\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive answer on how to use GCC Makefile optimization for incremental builds and dependency checking to achieve faster linking in 2026:\n\n## GCC Makefile Optimization for Incremental Builds and Faster Linking\n\n### 1. **Automatic Dependency Generation with GCC**\n\nThe most effective technique is using GCC's automatic dependency generation flags:\n\n```makefile\nCFLAGS += -MMD -MP -MF $(@:.o=.d)\n\n# Include generated dependency files\n-include $(OBJECTS:.o=.d)\n```\n\n- **`-MMD`**: Generates dependency files (`.d`) listing all header dependencies without system headers\n- **`-MP`**: Adds phony targets for each dependency to handle deleted headers gracefully\n- **`-MF`**: Specifies the output file for dependencies\n\n### 2. **Proper Incremental Build Structure**\n\n```makefile\n# Define source and object files\nSRCS := $(wildcard src/*.c)\nOBJS := $(SRCS:.c=.o)\nDEPS := $(OBJS:.o=.d)\n\n# Pattern rule with dependency generation\n%.o: %.c\n    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -MMD -MP -c $< -o $@\n\n# Include all dependency files\n-include $(DEPS)\n```\n\n### 3. **Faster Linking Strategies**\n\n- **Use parallel builds**: `make -j$(nproc)` to utilize all CPU cores\n- **Link-time optimization (LTO)**: Add `-flto` to both `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` for optimized linking\n- **Incremental linking**: Use `-fuse-ld=mold` or `-fuse-ld=lld` for faster modern linkers\n- **Modular libraries**: Split large projects into smaller static/shared libraries\n\n### 4. **Key Best Practices**\n\n| Practice | Benefit |\n|----------|---------|\n| Explicit target dependencies | Avoids 35%+ unnecessary recompilation issues |\n| Timestamp validation | Can reduce build times by up to 40% |\n| Modular Makefile structure | Improves maintainability by ~25% |\n| Use phony targets correctly | Prevents unnecessary rebuilds |\n\n### 5. **Example Optimized Makefile**\n\n```makefile\nCC := gcc\nCFLAGS := -Wall -O2 -MMD -MP\nLDFLAGS := -flto\nTARGET := myprogram\n\nSRCS := $(wildcard *.c)\nOBJS := $(SRCS:.c=.o)\nDEPS := $(OBJS:.o=.d)\n\n.PHONY: all clean\n\nall: $(TARGET)\n\n$(TARGET): $(OBJS)\n    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^\n\n%.o: %.c\n    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\n\n-include $(DEPS)\n\nclean:\n    rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS) $(DEPS)\n```\n\n###

comprehensive answer on how to use GCC Makefile optimization for incremental builds and dependency checking to achieve faster linking in 2026:\n\n## GCC Makefile Optimization for Incremental Builds and Faster Linking\n\n### 1. **Automatic Dependency Generation with GCC**\n\nThe most effective technique is using GCC's automatic dependency generation flags:\n\n```makefile\nCFLAGS += -MMD -MP -MF $(@:.o=.d)\n\n# Include generated dependency files\n-include $(OBJECTS:.o=.d)\n```\n\n- **`-MMD`**: Generates dependency files (`.d`) listing all header dependencies without system headers\n- **`-MP`**: Adds phony targets for each dependency to handle deleted headers gracefully\n- **`-MF`**: Specifies the output file for dependencies\n\n### 2. **Proper Incremental Build Structure**\n\n```makefile\n# Define source and object files\nSRCS := $(wildcard src/*.c)\nOBJS := $(SRCS:.c=.o)\nDEPS := $(OBJS:.o=.d)\n\n# Pattern rule with dependency generation\n%.o: %.c\n    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -MMD -MP -c $< -o $@\n\n# Include all dependency files\n-include $(DEPS)\n```\n\n### 3. **Faster Linking Strategies**\n\n- **Use parallel builds**: `make -j$(nproc)` to utilize all CPU cores\n- **Link-time optimization (LTO)**: Add `-flto` to both `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` for optimized linking\n- **Incremental linking**: Use `-fuse-ld=mold` or `-fuse-ld=lld` for faster modern linkers\n- **Modular libraries**: Split large projects into smaller static/shared libraries\n\n### 4. **Key Best Practices**\n\n| Practice | Benefit |\n|----------|---------|\n| Explicit target dependencies | Avoids 35%+ unnecessary recompilation issues |\n| Timestamp validation | Can reduce build times by up to 40% |\n| Modular Makefile structure | Improves maintainability by ~25% |\n| Use phony targets correctly | Prevents unnecessary rebuilds |\n\n### 5. **Example Optimized Makefile**\n\n```makefile\nCC := gcc\nCFLAGS := -Wall -O2 -MMD -MP\nLDFLAGS := -flto\nTARGET := myprogram\n\nSRCS := $(wildcard *.c)\nOBJS := $(SRCS:.c=.o)\nDEPS := $(OBJS:.o=.d)\n\n.PHONY: all clean\n\nall: $(TARGET)\n\n$(TARGET): $(OBJS)\n    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^\n\n%.o: %.c\n    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\n\n-include $(DEPS)\n\nclean:\n    rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS) $(DEPS)\n```\n\n### 6. **Additional Tips for 2026**\n\n- **Consider modern alternatives**: Tools like Ninja or CMake with Ninja generator can be even faster than Make\n- **Use ccache**: Cache compiled objects across builds with `CC := ccache gcc`\n- **Use mold linker**: The fastest linker available: `LDFLAGS += -fuse-ld=mold`\n- **Debug with `make -n`**: Simulate builds to identify missing dependencies before running\n\nThese techniques combined can reduce build times significantly—in some cases by 40-60%

see what would be built\nmake -d          # Debug mode - verbose dependency info\nmake --debug=v   # Show why targets are being rebuilt\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that only changed files are recompiled, dependencies are automatically tracked, and linking is optimized for speed—potentially improving build times by 30% or more compared to naive Makefile configurations.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I use GCC Makefile optimization for incremental builds and dependency checking to achieve faster linking in 2026?","timestamp":1558},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"GCC Makefile optimization incremental builds dependency checking faster linking 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":4205},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CmjLtrzEVx7TAfLh8FNCCJ","status":"completed","timestamp":13325},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search, here's a comprehensive answer on how to use GCC Makefile optimization for incremental builds and dependency checking to achieve faster linking in 2026:\n\n## GCC Makefile Optimization for Incremental Builds and Faster Linking\n\n### 1. **Automatic Dependency Generation with GCC**\n\nThe most critical technique is using GCC's built-in preprocessor flags to automatically generate dependency files:\n\n```makefile\n# Generate dependency files automatically\nDEPFLAGS = -MT $@ -MMD -MP -MF $(DEPDIR)/$*.d\n\n# Compile rule with dependency generation\n%.o: %.c\n    $(CC) $(DEPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\n\n# Include all dependency files\n-include $(wildcard $(DEPDIR)/*.d)\n```\n\n- **`-MMD`**: Generate dependency files for user headers (not system headers)\n- **`-MP`**: Add phony targets for each dependency to avoid \"No rule to make target\" errors\n- **`-MF`**: Specify the output dependency file\n\n### 2. **Optimization Flags for Faster Linking**\n\nUse appropriate optimization levels:\n\n```makefile\n# For development (faster compile, reasonable optimization)\nCFLAGS = -O1 -g\n\n# For release (better performance, longer compile)\nCFLAGS = -O2\n\n# Linker optimizations\nLDFLAGS = -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-O1\n```\n\n### 3. **Parallel Builds**\n\nLeverage multiple CPU cores:\n\n```bash\nmake -j$(nproc)   # Use all available cores\nmake -j8          # Or specify a number\n```\n\n### 4. **Proper Incremental Build Structure**\n\n```makefile\nSRCDIR = src\nOBJDIR = obj\nDEPDIR = dep\n\nSRCS = $(wildcard $(SRCDIR)/*.c)\nOBJS = $(SRCS:$(SRCDIR)/%.c=$(OBJDIR)/%.o)\nDEPS = $(SRCS:$(SRCDIR)/%.c=$(DEPDIR)/%.d)\n\n# Create directories if they don't exist\n$(shell mkdir -p $(OBJDIR) $(DEPDIR))\n\n# Pattern rule with dependency generation\n$(OBJDIR)/%.o: $(SRCDIR)/%.c $(DEPDIR)/%.d\n    $(CC) $(DEPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\n\n# Keep dependency files from being deleted\n$(DEPS):\n\n-include $(DEPS)\n```\n\n### 5. **Key Best Practices for 2026**\n\n1. **Modularize your project**: Split into smaller libraries to reduce rebuild scope by ~25-50%\n2. **Use `.d` files per source**: Store dependency files in a dedicated directory\n3. **Use built-in variables**: `$@` (target), `$<` (first prerequisite), `$^` (all prerequisites)\n4. **Declare phony targets properly**: \n   ```makefile\n   .PHONY: clean all install\n   ```\n5. **Use timestamp checks**: Only rebuild when source is newer than target\n6. **Consider ccache**: For repeated builds, ccache can dramatically speed up compilation\n\n### 6. **Faster Linking Techniques**\n\n- **Use shared libraries** for frequently unchanged code\n- **Enable Link-Time Optimization (LTO)** for release builds: `-flto`\n- **Use gold or mold linker** instead of the default ld:\n  ```makefile\n  LDFLAGS = -fuse-ld=mold   # or -fuse-ld=gold\n  ```\n- **Reduce symbol visibility**: `-fvisibility=hidden`\n\n### 7. **Debugging Build Issues**\n\n```bash\nmake -n          # Dry run -

Architecture Design\n\n### Core Components\nA production-grade RAG system consists of five essential components:\n1. **Document Ingestion Pipelines** - Handle various document types (PDFs, HTML, etc.) with robust version tracking and metadata management\n2. **Chunking Systems** - Use recursive chunking with overlaps, semantic chunking, or structure-aware methods to maintain context\n3. **Embedding Infrastructure** - Choose between managed APIs (OpenAI) or self-hosted models based on cost and performance requirements\n4. **Vector Databases** - Options include Pinecone (zero operational overhead), Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, or pgvector\n5. **Retrieval & Generation Pipeline** - Includes query transformation, hybrid search, reranking, and response generation\n\n### Architecture Patterns\n- **Dual Pipeline Architecture**: Separate ingestion and retrieval pipelines for efficient processing\n- **Four-Service Pattern**: Used by leading AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic) for scaling effectively\n- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine vector search with traditional sparse retrieval methods like BM25 for 33-47% accuracy improvement\n- **GraphRAG Implementation**: For complex reasoning tasks with better accuracy at lower cost\n\n## 2. Monitoring & Observability\n\n### Key Metrics to Track\n- **Retrieval Recall@K** - Measures retrieval effectiveness\n- **Answer Faithfulness** - Ensures generated responses match retrieved context\n- **Latency P95** - Keep under 3 seconds for optimal user experience\n- **Cost per Query** - Track API costs and resource utilization\n- **Hallucination Rates** - Studies show 17-33% occurrence even in RAG systems\n\n### Three Dimensions of Observability\n1. **Operational Observability** - Monitor latency, throughput, resource utilization, and node health\n2. **Quality Observability** - Assess semantic quality of outputs, retrieval relevance, and context utilization\n3. **Safety Observability** - Detect harmful behaviors, hallucinations, and bias\n\n### Top Observability Platforms (2026)\n- **Maxim AI** - Full-stack platform covering pre-deployment to production monitoring\n- **Langfuse** - Open-source observability and prompt management\n- **LangSmith** - Tracing for LangChain environments\n- **Arize** - Enterprise ML monitoring with LLM support\n- **Galileo** - Evaluation-first platform with Luna guardrails\n\n### Implementation Best Practices\n- Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring\n- Implement multi-level analysis frameworks (e.g., RAGTrace) for tracing knowledge sources\n- Set up alerts for critical thresholds (replication lag, embedding drift, query failures)\n- Monitor retrieval and generation quality separately with dual metrics\n\n## 3. Backup Strategies\n\n### Automated Backup Approaches\n- **Regular Automated Backups** - Mix of full and incremental backups\n- **Snapshot-Based Tools** - Use database-native tools (Qdrant, Milvus snapshots)\n- **Point-in-Time Recovery** - Implement Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) for safeguarding against data loss\n\n### Storage Best Practices\n- Store backups in **geographically distributed** object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob)\n- Use **versioned storage** to maintain multiple backup generations\n- Apply **encryption** to all backup data\n- Utilize **compression algorithms** (Zstandard) to minimize storage overhead\n\n### Backup Components to Cover\n1. **Vector Data** - The actual embeddings and document vectors\n2. **Metadata** - Document lineage, access rules, timestamps\n3. **Index Configurations** - Database settings and optimization parameters\n4. **Model Artifacts** - Embedding models and fine-tuned components\n\n### Testing Backups\n- Regularly restore sample data to verify backup integrity\n- Test full recovery procedures quarterly\n- Document recovery time for different scenarios\n\n## 4. Disaster Recovery\n\n### Replication Strategies\n- **Multi-Region Replication** - Establish redundancy across geographic locations\n- **Synchronous Replication** - For critical metadata requiring strong consistency\n- **Asynchronous Replication** - For vector data where some lag is acceptable\n- Use databases with native replication support (Pinecone, Weaviate)\n\n### High Availability Setup\n- Implement **leader-follower** or consensus protocols for data distribution\n- Use **Kubernetes orchestration** with custom auto-scaling based on RAG-specific metrics\n- Deploy **distributed file systems** or cloud-native solutions for databases lacking native replication\n\n### Recovery Objectives\n- Define clear **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** - Target time to restore service\n- Define **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** - Maximum acceptable data loss window\n- Prioritize systems based on business criticality\n\n### Testing & Automation\n- **Regularly simulate disaster scenarios** to validate recovery processes\n- Use **chaos engineering tools** to identify system weaknesses\n- Automate recovery workflows with **Terraform** or similar IaC tools\n- Maintain detailed documentation of all recovery steps\n- Verify performance is restored to pre-failure levels after recovery\n\n## 5. Additional Production Considerations\n\n### Security & Compliance\n- Implement **multi-tenancy** patterns for handling sensitive customer data\n- Address the **\"noisy neighbor\" problem** where one tenant's heavy usage impacts others\n- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations\n\n### Cost Optimization\n- Implement **semantic caching** to reduce LLM API calls (potential 68.8% cost reduction)\n- Use efficient chunking strategies to minimize token usage\n- Monitor and optimize embedding API costs\n\n### Operational Best Practices\n- Treat data ingestion as an **ongoing process**, not a one-time batch job\n- Maintain clear **document lineage** and traceability for regulated environments\n- Implement **deterministic chunking** with accountability tracking\n- Plan for scaling to millions of documents and thousands of concurrent queries\n\n### Data Freshness\n- Ensure document updates don't interrupt service\n- Make data corruption detectable and recoverable\n- Implement version tracking for all documents\n\n---\n\nThese best practices reflect the state of production RAG systems in 2026, emphasizing the shift from viewing RAG as a simple technique to treating it as a full production system requiring comprehensive operational infrastructure, continuous monitoring, and robust disaster recovery planning.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat are the best practices for production RAG system architecture including monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery in 2026?","timestamp":1510},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"best practices production RAG system architecture monitoring backup disaster recovery 2026","numResults":15},"timestamp":5895},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019dgCRqtwNfXp942FsmkvKL","status":"completed","timestamp":16781},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KNA1K2c3Cf13CToM4GxpwH","status":"completed","timestamp":16781},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011QfeivuMpSg5borML3WNff","status":"completed","timestamp":16781},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive web research, I can now provide you with a detailed answer on the best practices for production RAG system architecture including monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery in 2026.\n\n---\n\n# Best Practices for Production RAG System Architecture in 2026\n\n## 1.

Instead, it employs a **hybrid approach**:\n\n#### 1. WebSocket Connections via Map\n```typescript\nconnections: Map<\n  WebSocketLike,\n  {\n    clients: Set<any>;\n    connection: Connection;\n  }\n> = new Map();\n```\n- WebSocket-based connections are stored in a `Map` keyed by the WebSocket instance\n- Each entry tracks the `Connection` object and a `Set` of client IDs (for awareness tracking)\n\n#### 2.

Instead, it employs a **hybrid approach**:\n\n#### 1. WebSocket Connections via Map\n```typescript\nconnections: Map<\n  WebSocketLike,\n  {\n    clients: Set<any>;\n    connection: Connection;\n  }\n> = new Map();\n```\n- WebSocket-based connections are stored in a `Map` keyed by the WebSocket instance\n- Each entry tracks the `Connection` object and a `Set` of client IDs (for awareness tracking)\n\n#### 2. Direct Connections via Counter\n```typescript\ndirectConnectionsCount = 0;\n```\n- Direct (non-WebSocket/server-side) connections are tracked as a simple numeric counter\n- `addDirectConnection()` increments the counter\n- `removeDirectConnection()` decrements it (with floor at 0)\n\n### Connection Count Calculation\n```typescript\ngetConnectionsCount(): number {\n  return this.connections.size + this.directConnectionsCount;\n}\n```\n\n### DirectConnection Lifecycle\n\nThe **DirectConnection class** handles server-side document manipulation without WebSocket overhead:\n\n1. **Creation**: When `openDirectConnection(documentName, context)` is called on Hocuspocus:\n   - Creates/loads the document via `createDocument()`\n   - Instantiates a `DirectConnection` with the document reference\n   - Calls `document.addDirectConnection()` to increment the counter\n\n2. **Transaction**: The `transact()` method wraps document mutations with a `LocalTransactionOrigin` containing source (\"local\") and context\n\n3. **Disconnect Lifecycle**:\n   - Decrements `directConnectionsCount`\n   - Calls `storeDocumentHooks()` to persist changes\n   - If this was the last connection (`getConnectionsCount() === 0`) and no save mutex is locked:\n     - Triggers `onDisconnect` hook\n     - Calls `unloadDocument()` to remove from memory\n\n### Document Unloading Logic\n\nThe `shouldUnloadDocument()` method checks:\n- No pending debounced store operations\n- No currently executing store operations  \n- Save mutex not locked\n- Zero total connections\n\nThe `unloadDocument()` method:\n1.

Keep all your configuration in one well-organized `.org` file (e.g., `config.org` or `dotemacs.org`)\n- **Organize with headings and subheadings** - Use Org's hierarchical structure to group related configurations (e.g., UI settings, keybindings, language modes, packages)\n- **Modular code blocks** - Break configurations into standalone, reusable blocks that can be extracted to separate files if needed for sharing\n\n## 2. **Tangling Best Practices**\n- **Tangle to generate your init.el** - Use `:tangle yes` header arguments to extract elisp code blocks into executable files\n- **Use NOWEB syntax** for complex configurations - Break down large functions into smaller, documented pieces using `<<block-name>>` references\n- **Avoid loading Org at startup** - For faster initialization, pre-tangle your config rather than tangling on every startup (as recommended by Protesilaos Stavrou's 2026 guide)\n\n## 3. **Header Arguments**\n- Set appropriate header arguments:\n  - `:tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el` - Specify output file\n  - `:results silent` - Suppress output for configuration blocks\n  - `:noweb yes` - Enable NOWEB references between blocks\n\n## 4. **Documentation & Readability**\n- **Write prose explanations** alongside code - Explain *why* each configuration exists, not just what it does\n- **Include examples and use cases** - Especially for custom functions\n- **Use links and references** - Link to package documentation or relevant discussions\n- **Document for your future self** -

This approach, recommended by Protesilaos Stavrou in his 2026 configuration guide, keeps documentation and code together.\n\n- **Organize by use-case rather than per-package** – As configurations grow, group related packages by functional categories (e.g., \"Version Control,\" \"Writing,\" \"Development\").

This creates:\n- Accumulation of unresolved security flaws\n- Prioritization of immediate usability over maintainability and security\n- Threats to software supply chain integrity\n\n### Best Practices for Mitigating AI Code Security Risks\n\n1. **Never deploy AI-generated code without thorough security review**\n2. **Use parameterized queries** - Never use string interpolation for database queries\n3. **Validate all package dependencies** - Check that suggested packages actually exist\n4. **Implement proper input validation** - Don't trust AI to handle edge cases\n5. **Use environment variables** - Never accept hardcoded credentials\n6. **Apply principle of least privilege** - Always restrict IAM/cloud permissions beyond AI defaults\n7. **Employ hybrid security approaches** - Combine traditional static analysis tools with AI scanning\n8. **Implement authorization checks manually** - AI fails at context-dependent business logic decisions\n9. **Treat all AI output as untrusted** - Review with same rigor as unvetted third-party code\n10. **Use secure coding patterns explicitly** - Provide security context in prompts when possible\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe convenience of AI-generated code comes with significant security trade-offs. While AI tools dramatically increase development velocity (3-4x faster), they simultaneously introduce substantially more security vulnerabilities (up to 10x more issues). Organizations must implement rigorous review processes, as relying on AI without scrutiny leads to critical security issues in production environments.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat are the common security vulnerabilities and mistakes in AI-generated code including hallucinations and security patterns in 2026?","timestamp":1764},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"AI-generated code security vulnerabilities mistakes hallucinations 2026","numResults":15},"timestamp":5594},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014GXFP4tA6A6H5hmEKw4Bmd","status":"completed","timestamp":18323},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BPmazUzivpZ6G22vvp8WdH","status":"completed","timestamp":18323},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015pngicgVCj89vmh9eaVenV","status":"completed","timestamp":18323},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive web search, I can provide you with a detailed overview of the common security vulnerabilities and mistakes in AI-generated code, including hallucinations and security patterns in 2026.\n\n## Common Security Vulnerabilities and Mistakes in AI-Generated Code (2026)\n\n### Key Statistics\n- **45% of AI-generated code contains security flaws** (2026 research)\n- **68% of AI-generated projects contain at least one high-severity vulnerability**, averaging 4.2 security issues per project\n- AI-generated code introduces **1.7x more bugs** than human-written code\n- **Security issues are up to 2.74x more frequent** in AI-generated code compared to human code\n- **Java code has a failure rate exceeding 70%** for security vulnerabilities\n- **Python shows the highest vulnerability rates** (16.18%-18.50%)\n\n### Top 10 Security Vulnerabilities in AI-Generated Code\n\n1. **SQL Injection (31% of projects)** -

The broader system architecture\n\n3. **Semantic Limitations** - AI struggles with:\n   - Novel security architectures\n   - Proper error handling in complex systems\n   - Business logic and authorization decisions\n\n4. **Prioritization of Functionality Over Security** - LLMs prioritize generating plausible, functional code rather than secure code\n\n### Emerging Attack Vectors (2025-2026)\n\n1. **Prompt Injection Attacks** - Attackers embed malicious instructions within inputs, overriding system rules\n   - 99.4% success rate for jailbreaking GitHub Copilot\n   - 46.3% success rate for Amazon Q\n\n2. **Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO)** - Attackers subtly manipulate AI context without altering semantic correctness, achieving 75.72% success rate\n\n3. **IDEsaster Vulnerabilities** - 30+ security flaws discovered in AI-powered IDEs enabling data theft and remote code execution\n\n4. **Training Data Extraction** - Successful extraction of sensitive user data including emails and physical addresses from AI coding tools\n\n### \"Vibe Coding Debt\" - A New Security Risk Pattern\n\n\"Vibe Coding\" (term coined by Andrej Karpathy, 2025) describes using LLMs to create applications through natural language prompts. This creates:\n- Accumulation of unresolved security flaws\n- Prioritization of immediate usability over maintainability and security\n- Threats to software supply chain integrity\n\n### Best Practices for Mitigating AI Code Security Risks\n\n1. **Never deploy AI-generated code without thorough security review**\n2. **Use parameterized queries** - Never use string interpolation for database queries\n3. **Validate all package dependencies** - Check that suggested packages actually exist\n4. **Implement proper input validation** - Don't trust AI to handle edge cases\n5. **Use environment variables** - Never accept hardcoded credentials\n6. **Apply principle of least privilege** - Always restrict IAM/cloud permissions beyond AI defaults\n7. **Employ hybrid security approaches** - Combine traditional static analysis tools with AI scanning\n8. **Implement authorization checks manually** - AI fails at context-dependent business logic decisions\n9. **Treat all AI output as untrusted** - Review with same rigor as unvetted third-party code\n10. **Use secure coding patterns explicitly** - Provide security context in prompts when possible\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe convenience of AI-generated code comes with significant security trade-offs. While AI tools dramatically increase development velocity (3-4x faster), they simultaneously introduce substantially more security vulnerabilities (up to 10x more issues). Organizations must implement rigorous review processes, as relying on AI without scrutiny leads to critical security issues in production environments.","timestamp":52093}],"duration":52933,"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

Credential Management Architecture\n\n### Secure Credential Storage\n- **Use dedicated secrets management tools** like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager for centralized credential storage\n- **Implement credential vaults** with HSM-protected keys and automated encryption at rest and in transit\n- **Never hardcode credentials** in client-side code or commit them to repositories - manage all credentials server-side\n- **Use dynamic secrets over static API keys** - these are temporary, automatically generated, and reduce the attack surface significantly\n\n### Credential Lifecycle Management\n- **Automate credential rotation** with regular expiry policies to minimize risks from stale or leaked keys\n- **Implement clear ownership policies** - every credential should have a defined owner responsible for its lifecycle\n- **Delete unused credentials immediately** to reduce exposure to attacks\n- **Monitor and audit credential access** in real-time to detect misuse or anomalies\n\n---\n\n## 2. OAuth 2.0 Implementation (RFC 9700 Compliant)\n\n### Core OAuth Security (Per RFC 9700)\n- **Use OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow** for service-to-service integrations without user association\n- **Implement sender-constrained tokens** as recommended by FAPI 2.0 Security Profile for high-security applications\n- **Protect redirect-based flows** with proper validation of redirect URIs\n- **Apply token replay prevention** strategies for access and refresh tokens\n- **Restrict access token privileges** using scoped tokens that limit permissions to specific actions\n\n### Modern OAuth Patterns\n- **Leverage platform attestation** (per IETF WIMSE workload identity practices) - use platform credentials as assertions for OAuth authorization instead of provisioning static client secrets\n- **Implement Token Vault patterns** (like Auth0 Token Vault) - allow integrations to perform actions on behalf of users without directly handling sensitive refresh tokens\n- **Use the Org authorization server** unique to each tenant when building multi-tenant integrations\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Key Management\n\n### Key Generation & Distribution\n- **Generate keys with clear ownership** and track which integration/customer owns each key\n- **Use API key restrictions** - limit usage by IP, referrer, or specific API endpoints\n- **Never pass API keys as query parameters** in URLs - use HTTP headers (e.g., `x-goog-api-key`) instead\n\n### Access Controls\n- **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for API key usage\n- **Apply IP restrictions** to limit where keys can be used from\n- **Integrate with IAM systems** for unified identity and access management\n- **Support multi-cloud environments** for enterprise customers\n\n---\n\n## 4. Integration Marketplace Design\n\n### Self-Service Onboarding\n- **Build customer self-service portals** allowing users to manage their own integrations safely\n- **Provide clear documentation** with step-by-step onboarding guides\n- **Create user-friendly interfaces** for credential configuration\n- **Generate unique credentials per customer** - when a customer authorizes your integration, generate unique client ID and secret for their org\n\n### Security-First Architecture\n- **Adopt zero trust principles** - never implicitly trust any integration\n- **Implement API security gateways** with built-in security policies (50+ policies as recommended by platforms like Gravitee)\n- **Use embedded iPaaS platforms** with built-in security features rather than retrofitting security later\n\n---\n\n## 5. Security & Compliance\n\n### Core Security Principles\n- **Apply least privilege access** - limit integration access rights to only what's necessary\n- **Implement continuous monitoring** with behavioral detection to identify unusual activity\n- **Conduct pre-production security testing** throughout the development lifecycle\n- **Deploy defense in depth** - multiple layers of security controls\n\n### Compliance Considerations\n- **Support regulatory requirements** (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) with well-defined access control policies\n- **Implement audit logging** for all credential operations\n- **Use encrypted storage** for secrets with fine-grained access control\n\n---\n\n## 6. Modern Identity Patterns for 2026\n\n### Non-Human Identity (NHI) Management\n- **Automate NHI lifecycle management** - service accounts, API keys, and OAuth tokens need automated provisioning and rotation\n- **Minimize long-term credentials** by using short-lived alternatives\n- **Address \"zombie credentials\"** - implement automated cleanup of outdated credentials\n\n### Workload Identity Federation\n- **Use federation-based authentication** where workloads leverage platform credentials to authenticate with identity providers\n- **Implement service account token volume projection** in Kubernetes environments\n- **Eliminate manual secret provisioning** by using platform attestation\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials\n2. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application type)\n3. Set authorized redirect URIs\n4. Download the `client_secret.json` file\n\n### 2. **Basic OAuth 2.0 Implementation**\n\n```javascript\nconst { google } = require('googleapis');\nconst { OAuth2Client } = require('google-auth-library');\n\n// Initialize OAuth2 client\nconst oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(\n  process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,\n  process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,\n  process.env.REDIRECT_URI\n);\n\n// Generate authorization URL with necessary scopes\nconst authUrl = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n  access_type: 'offline', // Required to get refresh token\n  scope: [\n    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly',\n    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload'\n  ],\n  prompt: 'consent' // Forces consent screen to get new refresh token\n});\n\n// Exchange authorization code for tokens\nasync function getTokens(authorizationCode) {\n  const { tokens } = await oauth2Client.getToken(authorizationCode);\n  oauth2Client.setCredentials(tokens);\n  return tokens;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Refresh Token Security Best Practices (RFC 9700 & Google Guidelines)**\n\n#### **A. Secure Storage of Credentials**\n\n```javascript\n// Use environment variables or secret managers - NEVER hardcode\nconst credentials = {\n  clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,\n  clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,\n};\n\n// For production, use Google Cloud Secret Manager or similar\nconst { SecretManagerServiceClient } = require('@google-cloud/secret-manager');\n\nasync function getSecret(secretName) {\n  const client = new SecretManagerServiceClient();\n  const [version] = await client.accessSecretVersion({\n    name: `projects/${projectId}/secrets/${secretName}/versions/latest`,\n  });\n  return version.payload.data.toString();\n}\n```\n\n#### **B. Encrypt Refresh Tokens at Rest**\n\n```javascript\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\n\nconst ENCRYPTION_KEY = process.env.TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY; // 32 bytes\nconst IV_LENGTH = 16;\n\nfunction encryptToken(token) {\n  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(IV_LENGTH);\n  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'hex'), iv);\n  let encrypted = cipher.update(token, 'utf8', 'hex');\n  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');\n  return iv.toString('hex') + ':' + encrypted;\n}\n\nfunction decryptToken(encryptedToken) {\n  const [ivHex, encrypted] = encryptedToken.split(':');\n  const iv = Buffer.from(ivHex, 'hex');\n  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'hex'), iv);\n  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');\n  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');\n  return decrypted;\n}\n\n// Store encrypted token in database\nasync function storeRefreshToken(userId, refreshToken) {\n  const encryptedToken = encryptToken(refreshToken);\n  await db.users.update({\n    where: { id: userId },\n    data: { encryptedRefreshToken: encryptedToken }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n#### **C. Automatic Token Refresh Handling**\n\n```javascript\n// The googleapis library handles automatic token refresh\noauth2Client.setCredentials({\n  refresh_token: decryptToken(user.encryptedRefreshToken)\n});\n\n// Listen for new tokens when automatically refreshed\noauth2Client.on('tokens', async (tokens) => {\n  if (tokens.refresh_token) {\n    // Store the new refresh token securely (Google may rotate it)\n    await storeRefreshToken(userId, tokens.refresh_token);\n  }\n  // Access token is automatically updated in the client\n});\n\n// Make API calls - tokens refresh automatically when expired\nconst youtube = google.youtube({ version: 'v3', auth: oauth2Client });\nconst response = await youtube.channels.list({\n  part: 'snippet,contentDetails,statistics',\n  mine: true\n});\n```\n\n#### **D. Implement Token Revocation**\n\n```javascript\nasync function revokeUserTokens(userId) {\n  const user = await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });\n  \n  if (user.encryptedRefreshToken) {\n    const refreshToken = decryptToken(user.encryptedRefreshToken);\n    \n    // Revoke token with Google\n    await oauth2Client.revokeToken(refreshToken);\n    \n    // Delete from your database\n    await db.users.update({\n      where: { id: userId },\n      data: { encryptedRefreshToken: null }\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### **E. Handle Token Expiration/Invalidation**\n\n```javascript\nasync function makeAuthenticatedRequest(userId, apiCall) {\n  try {\n    return await apiCall();\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.code === 401 || error.message.includes('invalid_grant')) {\n      // Refresh token is invalid/expired - user needs to re-authenticate\n      await db.users.update({\n        where: { id: userId },\n        data: { \n          encryptedRefreshToken: null,\n          requiresReauth: true \n        }\n      });\n      throw new Error('Authentication expired. Please sign in again.');\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### **F. Use PKCE for Enhanced Security (Recommended)**\n\n```javascript\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\n\nfunction generatePKCE() {\n  const codeVerifier = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url');\n  const codeChallenge = crypto\n    .createHash('sha256')\n    .update(codeVerifier)\n    .digest('base64url');\n  \n  return { codeVerifier, codeChallenge };\n}\n\n// Generate auth URL with PKCE\nconst { codeVerifier, codeChallenge } = generatePKCE();\n\nconst authUrl = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n  access_type: 'offline',\n  scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly'],\n  code_challenge: codeChallenge,\n  code_challenge_method: 'S256'\n});\n\n// Store codeVerifier in session, then use it when exchanging code\nconst { tokens } = await oauth2Client.getToken({\n  code: authorizationCode,\n  codeVerifier: codeVerifier\n});\n```\n\n#### **G. Incremental Authorization (Request Minimal Scopes)**\n\n```javascript\n// Start with minimal scope\nconst basicAuthUrl = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n  access_type: 'offline',\n  scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly']\n});\n\n// Later, request additional scopes only when needed\nconst uploadAuthUrl = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n  access_type: 'offline',\n  scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload'],\n  include_granted_scopes: true // Include previously granted scopes\n});\n```\n\n### 4. **Key Security Recommendations Summary (Per RFC 9700 & Google Best Practices)**\n\n| Practice | Implementation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **Store credentials securely** | Use secret managers (Google Cloud Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager) |\n| **Encrypt tokens at rest** | AES-256 encryption for stored refresh tokens |\n| **Use HTTPS everywhere** | Never transmit tokens over unencrypted connections |\n| **Implement PKCE** | Required for public clients, recommended for all |\n| **Minimize token scope** | Request only necessary permissions |\n| **Handle token invalidation** | Gracefully prompt re-authentication when tokens expire |\n| **Revoke unused tokens** | Delete and revoke tokens when no longer needed |\n| **Use state parameter** | Prevent CSRF attacks in OAuth flows |\n| **Validate redirect URIs** | Use exact URI matching, avoid wildcards |\n| **Monitor for token misuse** | Implement logging and alerting for suspicious activity |\n\n### 5. **Important Notes for 2026**\n\n- **Refresh tokens can expire**: For apps in \"testing\" mode, Google refresh tokens expire after 7 days. Publish your app for production use to get long-lived refresh tokens.\n- **Token rotation**: Google may issue a new refresh token during token refresh - always store the latest one.\n- **Service accounts**: For server-to-server automation (without user context), consider using service accounts instead, though note that YouTube API has limited service account support.\n\nThis implementation follows the latest OAuth 2.0 security best practices from RFC 9700 (January 2025) and Google's official guidelines, ensuring your YouTube API integration is secure and maintainable.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I implement YouTube API OAuth 2.0 with refresh token security best practices in Node.js in 2026?","timestamp":2105},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"YouTube API OAuth 2.0 refresh token security best practices Node.js 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":4958},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01ToSAhM6tFJbXd8vKmbeDfv","status":"completed","timestamp":17876},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01U9hkHNJToQcupdchUyxaRu","status":"completed","timestamp":17876},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search results, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer on how to implement YouTube API OAuth 2.0 with refresh token security best practices in Node.js in 2026.\n\n## Implementing YouTube API OAuth 2.0 with Refresh Token Security Best Practices in Node.js (2026)\n\n### 1. **Setup & Prerequisites**\n\nFirst, install the official Google API Node.js client:\n\n```bash\nnpm install googleapis google-auth-library\n```\n\nCreate OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Google Cloud Console:\n1.

Setup and Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install googleapis google-auth-library\n```\n\n### 2. OAuth 2.0 Client Configuration\n\n```javascript\nconst { google } = require('googleapis');\nconst { OAuth2Client } = require('google-auth-library');\n\nconst oauth2Client = new OAuth2Client(\n  process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,\n  process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,\n  process.env.REDIRECT_URI\n);\n```\n\n### 3. Authorization Flow with Offline Access (to get refresh token)\n\n```javascript\n// Generate authorization URL requesting offline access\nconst authUrl = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n  access_type: 'offline',  // Required for refresh token\n  prompt: 'consent',       // Force consent to always get refresh token\n  scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly']\n});\n\n// After user consent, exchange code for tokens\nasync function getTokens(code) {\n  const { tokens } = await oauth2Client.getToken(code);\n  oauth2Client.setCredentials(tokens);\n  return tokens; // Contains access_token and refresh_token\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Refresh Token Management\n\n```javascript\nconst { UserRefreshClient } = require('google-auth-library');\n\n// Using refresh token to get new access tokens\nasync function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken) {\n  const client = new UserRefreshClient({\n    clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,\n    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,\n    refreshToken: refreshToken,\n  });\n  \n  const accessToken = await client.getAccessToken();\n  return accessToken.token;\n}\n\n// Or use OAuth2Client directly\noauth2Client.setCredentials({\n  refresh_token: 'YOUR_ENCRYPTED_REFRESH_TOKEN'\n});\nconst tokens = await oauth2Client.getAccessToken();\n```\n\n### 5. Security Best Practices (RFC 9700 & 2026 Standards)\n\n#### **A. Secure Token Storage**\n```javascript\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\n\n// Encrypt refresh tokens before storing\nfunction encryptToken(token) {\n  const algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';\n  const key = Buffer.from(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'hex'); // 32 bytes\n  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);\n  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);\n  \n  let encrypted = cipher.update(token, 'utf8', 'hex');\n  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');\n  const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag().toString('hex');\n  \n  return `${iv.toString('hex')}:${authTag}:${encrypted}`;\n}\n\nfunction decryptToken(encryptedData) {\n  const [ivHex, authTagHex, encrypted] = encryptedData.split(':');\n  const algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';\n  const key = Buffer.from(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'hex');\n  const iv = Buffer.from(ivHex, 'hex');\n  const authTag = Buffer.from(authTagHex, 'hex');\n  \n  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);\n  decipher.setAuthTag(authTag);\n  \n  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');\n  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');\n  return decrypted;\n}\n```\n\n#### **B. Refresh Token Rotation**\n```javascript\n// Issue new refresh token on each use and invalidate old one\nasync function rotateRefreshToken(userId, oldRefreshToken) {\n  oauth2Client.setCredentials({ refresh_token: decryptToken(oldRefreshToken) });\n  \n  const { credentials } = await oauth2Client.refreshAccessToken();\n  \n  // If a new refresh token is issued, update storage\n  if (credentials.refresh_token) {\n    const encryptedNewToken = encryptToken(credentials.refresh_token);\n    await database.updateRefreshToken(userId, encryptedNewToken);\n  }\n  \n  return credentials.access_token;\n}\n```\n\n#### **C.

Refresh Token Rotation**\n```javascript\n// Issue new refresh token on each use and invalidate old one\nasync function rotateRefreshToken(userId, oldRefreshToken) {\n  oauth2Client.setCredentials({ refresh_token: decryptToken(oldRefreshToken) });\n  \n  const { credentials } = await oauth2Client.refreshAccessToken();\n  \n  // If a new refresh token is issued, update storage\n  if (credentials.refresh_token) {\n    const encryptedNewToken = encryptToken(credentials.refresh_token);\n    await database.updateRefreshToken(userId, encryptedNewToken);\n  }\n  \n  return credentials.access_token;\n}\n```\n\n#### **C. Token Expiration & Revocation**\n```javascript\n// Revoke tokens when user logs out or on suspicious activity\nasync function revokeToken(token) {\n  await oauth2Client.revokeToken(token);\n}\n\n// Check token validity before use\noauth2Client.on('tokens', (tokens) => {\n  if (tokens.refresh_token) {\n    // New refresh token issued - store securely\n    storeEncryptedToken(tokens.refresh_token);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### 6.

This eliminates client-side state complexity:\n\n```jsx\n// Simple server-side aggregation - no state management needed\nasync function DashboardMetrics() {\n  const [users, orders, revenue] = await Promise.all([\n    db.users.count(),\n    db.orders.aggregate({ _sum: { total: true } }),\n    db.revenue.findMany({ where: { period: 'monthly' } })\n  ]);\n  \n  return <MetricsDisplay users={users} orders={orders} revenue={revenue} />;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Use URL State Over Client State**\nFor search, filters, and pagination, use URL search parameters (`useSearchParams`, `usePathname`, `useRouter`) instead of complex state. This keeps state shareable and bookmarkable without extra code.\n\n### 3. **Avoid Common Anti-Patterns**\n- **Don't make everything a Client Component** - Keep static/data-fetching components as Server Components\n- **Don't over-use state management** - Use local state or Context API for simple needs\n- **Aggregate API calls** - Combine related data fetches to minimize requests\n- **Use static generation** where real-time data isn't required\n\n### 4. **Simple Aggregation Pattern**\nFetch data where it's needed (co-located data fetching) rather than global data stores:\n\n```jsx\n// Each component fetches its own data - Next.js automatically memoizes\nexport default async function AdminPage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <UserStats />      {/* Fetches user data internally */}\n      <RevenueChart />   {/* Fetches revenue data internally */}\n      <RecentOrders />   {/* Fetches order data internally */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Start with a Proven Template**\nConsider starting with established templates like **TailAdmin**, **Devias Kit**, or **Next.js shadcn Dashboard Starter** (5.9k GitHub stars).

This eliminates client-side state complexity:\n\n```jsx\n// Simple server-side aggregation - no state management needed\nasync function DashboardMetrics() {\n  const [users, orders, revenue] = await Promise.all([\n    db.users.count(),\n    db.orders.aggregate({ _sum: { total: true } }),\n    db.revenue.findMany({ where: { period: 'monthly' } })\n  ]);\n  \n  return <MetricsDisplay users={users} orders={orders} revenue={revenue} />;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Use URL State Over Client State**\nFor search, filters, and pagination, use URL search parameters (`useSearchParams`, `usePathname`, `useRouter`) instead of complex state. This keeps state shareable and bookmarkable without extra code.\n\n### 3. **Avoid Common Anti-Patterns**\n- **Don't make everything a Client Component** - Keep static/data-fetching components as Server Components\n- **Don't over-use state management** - Use local state or Context API for simple needs\n- **Aggregate API calls** - Combine related data fetches to minimize requests\n- **Use static generation** where real-time data isn't required\n\n### 4. **Simple Aggregation Pattern**\nFetch data where it's needed (co-located data fetching) rather than global data stores:\n\n```jsx\n// Each component fetches its own data - Next.js automatically memoizes\nexport default async function AdminPage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <UserStats />      {/* Fetches user data internally */}\n      <RevenueChart />   {/* Fetches revenue data internally */}\n      <RecentOrders />   {/* Fetches order data internally */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Start with a Proven Template**\nConsider starting with established templates like **TailAdmin**, **Devias Kit**, or **Next.js shadcn Dashboard Starter** (5.9k GitHub stars). These provide pre-built patterns without requiring you to architect everything from scratch.\n\n### 6. **Use Streaming and Suspense**\nInstead of blocking entire page loads, use React Suspense to progressively render dashboard components:\n\n```jsx\n<Suspense fallback={<MetricsSkeleton />}>\n  <DashboardMetrics />\n</Suspense>\n```\n\n### Summary\nThe core principle: **let Next.js do the heavy lifting**.

Start with a monolithic Next.js application and only split services when there's a clear scaling need.\n\n### 7. **Use Serverless Architecture**\nOpt for zero-maintenance, auto-scaling serverless patterns rather than managing complex infrastructure. This pairs well with platforms like Vercel, Supabase, and similar managed services.\n\n### 8. **Pragmatic State Management**\nUse simpler state solutions like Zustand over Redux for dashboard state. Only implement complex state management when the dashboard genuinely requires it.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The 2026 approach emphasizes simplicity—use Server Components for data aggregation, leverage pre-built templates, focus on essential metrics, and avoid complex architectural patterns until they're genuinely needed.

Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Hybrid Combine + async/await**: Use Combine for continuous streams (WebSocket messages, user input) and async/await for discrete one-off tasks (API calls, authentication).\n\n2. **Memory Management**: Always use `[weak self]` in closures and store cancellables properly to avoid memory leaks.\n\n3. **Error Handling with Exponential Backoff**: Implement automatic reconnection with increasing delays:\n   ```swift\n   private func reconnect(attempt: Int = 0) {\n       let delay = min(pow(2.0, Double(attempt)), 30.0) // Max 30 seconds\n       DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + delay) {\n           self.connect()\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Secure Connections**: Always use `wss://` (WebSocket Secure) and implement JWT token refresh:\n   ```swift\n   func connect(with token: String) {\n       var request = URLRequest(url: webSocketURL)\n       request.setValue(\"Bearer \\(token)\", forHTTPHeaderField: \"Authorization\")\n       webSocketTask = session.webSocketTask(with: request)\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Message Queue for Offline Support**: Cache unsent messages and retry when connection is restored.\n\n6. **Typing Indicators with Debounce**: Use Combine's `.debounce()` operator to avoid flooding the server.\n\n7. **Heartbeat/Ping**: Implement ping/pong to keep connections alive:\n   ```swift\n   private func startPinging() {\n       Timer.publish(every: 30, on: .main, in: .common)\n           .autoconnect()\n           .sink { [weak self] _ in\n               self?.webSocketTask?.sendPing { error in\n                   if error != nil {\n                       self?.handleReconnection()\n                   }\n               }\n           }\n           .store(in: &cancellables)\n   }\n   ```\n\n8. **Protocol Isolation for Testing**: Create protocols for your services to enable dependency injection and unit testing.\n\n9. **Use `@MainActor`**: Ensure UI updates happen on the main thread using Swift's `@MainActor` attribute on ViewModels.\n\n10. **Structured Concurrency**: Use Task groups for batch operations and cancellation handling.\n\nThis architecture provides a production-ready foundation for real-time chat applications with proper separation of concerns, reactive data flow, and modern Swift best practices.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I implement Swift Combine framework WebSocket real-time chat with MVVM architecture and best practices in 2026?","timestamp":1528},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"Swift Combine framework WebSocket real-time chat MVVM architecture best practices 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":5847},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01JoewNAYpaDEFaarUjidLeM","status":"completed","timestamp":23252},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014ceoSyUnMgvQUKWMv8mMN1","status":"completed","timestamp":23252},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EeVPLkmHxCEDvv2TiyHb5T","status":"completed","timestamp":23252},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive web search, I can now provide you with a detailed guide on implementing Swift Combine framework WebSocket real-time chat with MVVM architecture and best practices in 2026.\n\n## How to Implement Swift Combine Framework WebSocket Real-Time Chat with MVVM Architecture (2026 Best Practices)\n\n### 1.

Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Hybrid Combine + async/await**: Use Combine for continuous streams (WebSocket messages, user input) and async/await for discrete one-off tasks (API calls, authentication).\n\n2. **Memory Management**: Always use `[weak self]` in closures and store cancellables properly to avoid memory leaks.\n\n3. **Error Handling with Exponential Backoff**: Implement automatic reconnection with increasing delays:\n   ```swift\n   private func reconnect(attempt: Int = 0) {\n       let delay = min(pow(2.0, Double(attempt)), 30.0) // Max 30 seconds\n       DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + delay) {\n           self.connect()\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Secure Connections**: Always use `wss://` (WebSocket Secure) and implement JWT token refresh:\n   ```swift\n   func connect(with token: String) {\n       var request = URLRequest(url: webSocketURL)\n       request.setValue(\"Bearer \\(token)\", forHTTPHeaderField: \"Authorization\")\n       webSocketTask = session.webSocketTask(with: request)\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Message Queue for Offline Support**: Cache unsent messages and retry when connection is restored.\n\n6. **Typing Indicators with Debounce**: Use Combine's `.debounce()` operator to avoid flooding the server.\n\n7. **Heartbeat/Ping**: Implement ping/pong to keep connections alive:\n   ```swift\n   private func startPinging() {\n       Timer.publish(every: 30, on: .main, in: .common)\n           .autoconnect()\n           .sink { [weak self] _ in\n               self?.webSocketTask?.sendPing { error in\n                   if error != nil {\n                       self?.handleReconnection()\n                   }\n               }\n           }\n           .store(in: &cancellables)\n   }\n   ```\n\n8. **Protocol Isolation for Testing**: Create protocols for your services to enable dependency injection and unit testing.\n\n9. **Use `@MainActor`**: Ensure UI updates happen on the main thread using Swift's `@MainActor` attribute on ViewModels.\n\n10. **Structured Concurrency**: Use Task groups for batch operations and cancellation handling.\n\nThis architecture provides a production-ready foundation for real-time chat applications with proper separation of concerns, reactive data flow, and modern Swift best practices.","timestamp":58902}],"duration":59665,"pass":true,"score":0.99,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

not regular `<a>` tags for internal navigation\n3. **Use `usePathname()` from `'next/navigation'`** - to detect and style active links\n4. **Define TypeScript interfaces** for props and nav items\n5. **Implement accessibility** - aria-labels, aria-expanded, semantic HTML\n6. **Sticky positioning** with backdrop blur for modern UX\n7. **Responsive design** - separate desktop/mobile navigation patterns\n8. **Prefetching** - automatic with `<Link>` component for faster navigation\n\n### Usage in Layout:\n\n```typescript\n// app/layout.tsx\nimport Navigation from '@/components/Header/Navigation';\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <Navigation />\n        <main>{children}</main>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat does a professional Next.js 15 and React 19 navigation header component look like with TypeScript in 2026?","timestamp":1428},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"Next.js 15 React 19 navigation header component TypeScript 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":4736},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Eo59fFJB4HPMsz6UiGvXGs","status":"completed","timestamp":15885},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01E62nJLbwqF9WgmcXiZRc3b","status":"completed","timestamp":15885},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Vf7iVSuzTqPj13iVSnwnmn","status":"completed","timestamp":33334},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Pb81vxZCJff7kVhv1xBbsy","status":"completed","timestamp":33334},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about what a professional Next.js 15 and React 19 navigation header component looks like with TypeScript in 2026.\n\n## Professional Next.js 15 + React 19 Navigation Header Component (TypeScript)\n\nA modern, professional navigation header component in Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript follows these key patterns:\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n\n1. **Client Component with `'use client'` directive** -

Prerequisites & Setup\n\nFirst, install the Wails CLI:\n```bash\ngo install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest\n```\n\nVerify installation:\n```bash\nwails doctor\n```\n\n### 2. Create a New Wails Project with React\n\nInitialize a new Wails project using the React template:\n```bash\nwails init -n myproject -t react\n# Or for TypeScript:\nwails init -n myproject -t react-ts\n```\n\n### 3. Migrate Your React Frontend\n\n1. **Copy your existing React files** from your Tauri project's frontend directory to the Wails `frontend/` directory\n2. **Update `wails.json`** to configure build commands:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"frontend:install\": \"npm install\",\n     \"frontend:build\": \"npm run build\"\n   }\n   ```\n3. **Preserve dependencies** by copying your `package.json` dependencies\n\n### 4. Key Architecture Differences to Handle\n\n| Tauri (Rust) | Wails v2 (Go) |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| `invoke()` API | `window.go.ServiceName.MethodName()` |\n| `#[tauri::command]` | Bound struct methods |\n| `tauri.conf.json` | `wails.json` |\n| Event system | `runtime.EventsEmit()` / `runtime.EventsOn()` |\n\n### 5. Rewrite Backend Logic (Rust → Go)\n\n**Tauri Rust example:**\n```rust\n#[tauri::command]\nfn greet(name: &str) -> String {\n    format!(\"Hello, {}!\", name)\n}\n```\n\n**Wails Go equivalent:**\n```go\ntype App struct {\n    ctx context.Context\n}\n\nfunc (a *App) Greet(name string) string {\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello, %s!\", name)\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Update Frontend API Calls\n\n**Tauri invoke:**\n```javascript\nimport { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/tauri';\nconst result = await invoke('greet', { name: 'World' });\n```\n\n**Wails binding:**\n```javascript\nimport { Greet } from '../wailsjs/go/main/App';\nconst result = await Greet('World');\n```\n\n### 7. Binding Generation\n\nRun the bindings generator to create TypeScript/JavaScript bindings:\n```bash\nwails generate bindings\n```\n\nThis creates files in `frontend/wailsjs/` that mirror your Go structs and methods.\n\n### 8.

Prerequisites & Setup\n\nFirst, install the Wails CLI:\n```bash\ngo install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest\n```\n\nVerify installation:\n```bash\nwails doctor\n```\n\n### 2. Create a New Wails Project with React\n\nInitialize a new Wails project using the React template:\n```bash\nwails init -n myproject -t react\n# Or for TypeScript:\nwails init -n myproject -t react-ts\n```\n\n### 3. Migrate Your React Frontend\n\n1. **Copy your existing React files** from your Tauri project's frontend directory to the Wails `frontend/` directory\n2. **Update `wails.json`** to configure build commands:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"frontend:install\": \"npm install\",\n     \"frontend:build\": \"npm run build\"\n   }\n   ```\n3. **Preserve dependencies** by copying your `package.json` dependencies\n\n### 4. Key Architecture Differences to Handle\n\n| Tauri (Rust) | Wails v2 (Go) |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| `invoke()` API | `window.go.ServiceName.MethodName()` |\n| `#[tauri::command]` | Bound struct methods |\n| `tauri.conf.json` | `wails.json` |\n| Event system | `runtime.EventsEmit()` / `runtime.EventsOn()` |\n\n### 5. Rewrite Backend Logic (Rust → Go)\n\n**Tauri Rust example:**\n```rust\n#[tauri::command]\nfn greet(name: &str) -> String {\n    format!(\"Hello, {}!\", name)\n}\n```\n\n**Wails Go equivalent:**\n```go\ntype App struct {\n    ctx context.Context\n}\n\nfunc (a *App) Greet(name string) string {\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello, %s!\", name)\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Update Frontend API Calls\n\n**Tauri invoke:**\n```javascript\nimport { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/tauri';\nconst result = await invoke('greet', { name: 'World' });\n```\n\n**Wails binding:**\n```javascript\nimport { Greet } from '../wailsjs/go/main/App';\nconst result = await Greet('World');\n```\n\n### 7. Binding Generation\n\nRun the bindings generator to create TypeScript/JavaScript bindings:\n```bash\nwails generate bindings\n```\n\nThis creates files in `frontend/wailsjs/` that mirror your Go structs and methods.\n\n### 8. Lifecycle Hooks Migration\n\n| Tauri | Wails v2 |\n|-------|----------|\n| `setup()` | `OnStartup(ctx context.Context)` |\n| Window close handler | `OnShutdown(ctx context.Context)` |\n| Frontend ready | `OnDomReady(ctx context.Context)` |\n\n### 9.

Migration Steps\n\n**Step 1: Copy Your React Frontend**\n- Copy your React source files (`src/`, `public/`, `package.json`, etc.) into the `frontend/` directory of your new Wails project\n- Update `wails.json` to configure frontend paths:\n```json\n{\n  \"frontend:dir\": \"frontend\",\n  \"frontend:install\": \"npm install\",\n  \"frontend:build\": \"npm run build\"\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite Backend Logic in Go**\n\nConvert Tauri commands to Wails services. In Tauri you might have:\n```rust\n#[tauri::command]\nfn greet(name: &str) -> String {\n    format!(\"Hello, {}!\", name)\n}\n```\n\nIn Wails v2 (Go), create a struct with methods:\n```go\ntype App struct {\n    ctx context.Context\n}\n\nfunc (a *App) Greet(name string) string {\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello, %s!\", name)\n}\n```\n\n**Step 3: Update Frontend IPC Calls**\n\nReplace Tauri's `invoke()` with Wails bindings. In Tauri:\n```javascript\nimport { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api';\nconst result = await invoke('greet', { name: 'World' });\n```\n\nIn Wails v2:\n```javascript\nimport { Greet } from '../wailsjs/go/main/App';\nconst result = await Greet('World');\n```\n\nWails automatically generates type-safe JavaScript bindings from your Go code.\n\n**Step 4: Configure Application Lifecycle**\n\nIn Wails v2, configure lifecycle hooks in your `main.go`:\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    app := &App{}\n    \n    err := wails.Run(&options.App{\n        Title:     \"My App\",\n        Width:     1024,\n        Height:    768,\n        OnStartup: app.startup,\n        OnShutdown: app.shutdown,\n        OnDomReady: app.domReady,\n        Bind: []interface{}{\n            app,\n        },\n    })\n}\n```\n\n**Step 5: Handle Assets**\n\nWails v2 uses Go's `embed.FS` for assets:\n```go\n//go:embed all:frontend/dist\nvar assets embed.FS\n\nfunc main() {\n    wails.Run(&options.App{\n        Assets: assets,\n        // ...\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Development Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Live development with hot reload\nwails dev\n\n# Build for production\nwails build\n```\n\nAccess your app at `http://localhost:34115` during development.\n\n### 5. Key Advantages of Wails v2\n\n- **Simpler IPC**: Automatic type-safe binding generation eliminates manual JSON handling\n- **Faster builds**: Go compiles faster than Rust\n- **Smaller build cache**: ~8MB app bundles vs Tauri's ~4GB build cache\n- **Easier learning curve**: Go is generally simpler than Rust\n\n### 6. Common Migration Challenges\n\n1. **File system APIs**: Tauri's `@tauri-apps/api/fs` needs to be replaced with Go backend calls\n2. **Window management**: Use Wails runtime package instead of Tauri window APIs\n3. **System tray**: Implement using Wails' native menu support\n4. **Plugin ecosystem**: Tauri plugins won't work; find Go equivalents or implement natively\n\nThis migration allows you to preserve your React frontend investment while switching to a Go backend, which many developers find offers a better development experience with faster compile times and simpler error handling compared to Rust.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nHow do I migrate from Tauri with Rust backend to Wails v2 with a Go backend while preserving my React frontend in 2026?","timestamp":1616},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"migrate Tauri Rust to Wails v2 Go backend React frontend 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":5613},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HGFPTioHjzUg1bgk3xSzvf","status":"completed","timestamp":17205},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BCazAEJMdbRf1AxqCBX9k3","status":"completed","timestamp":17206},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01TEQj5o493hzG7HEypreQSm","status":"completed","timestamp":17206},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search research, here's a comprehensive guide on migrating from Tauri with Rust backend to Wails v2 with a Go backend while preserving your React frontend:\n\n## Migration Guide: Tauri (Rust) to Wails v2 (Go) with React Frontend\n\n### 1.

Understanding Hybrid Search Architecture\n\n**Best Practice: Combine Dense + Sparse Retrieval**\n- **Dense embeddings** (vector search): Capture semantic meaning and context\n- **Sparse embeddings** (BM25, SPLADE): Handle exact keyword matching and precision\n- Pure semantic search often misses exact matches; hybrid search addresses this limitation with **15-30% improved retrieval accuracy**\n\n**The Hybrid Formula:**\n```\nH = (1-α)K + αV\n```\nWhere K = keyword/lexical score, V = vector similarity score, α = balancing weight\n\n### 2. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) Implementation\n\n**Core RRF Formula:**\n```\nRRF_score(d) = Σ 1/(k + rank_i(d))\n```\nWhere:\n- `d` = document\n- `k` = smoothing constant (commonly **60**)\n- `rank_i(d)` = rank of document d in result list i\n\n**Why RRF Works:**\n- **No score normalization needed** - works purely on rank positions\n- **Resistant to outliers** - aggregates rankings rather than scores\n- **Cross-system consensus** - documents appearing highly in multiple lists get prioritized\n- **Stable across diverse score distributions** - avoids unbalanced rankings from different retrieval methods\n\n**Tuning the k Parameter:**\n- **Lower k (e.g., 20-40)**: Emphasizes precision, top-ranked items have more influence\n- **Higher k (e.g., 60-100)**: Enhances recall and consensus across lists\n- **Default k=60** is recommended as a starting point for most production systems\n\n### 3. Production Implementation Best Practices\n\n**Architecture Choices:**\n| Database | Hybrid Search Support |\n|----------|----------------------|\n| Weaviate | Native hybrid search |\n| OpenSearch 2.19+ | Native RRF in Neural Search plugin |\n| Elasticsearch | Linear Retriever + RRF |\n| PostgreSQL + pgvector | Custom implementation required |\n| SingleStore | SQL-based RRF |\n| MariaDB | Built-in RRF optimization |\n| Azure AI Search | Native RRF for hybrid queries |\n\n**Two-Stage Reranking Pipeline:**\n1. **Stage 1: Hybrid Retrieval** - Run BM25 + vector search in parallel\n2. **Stage 2: RRF Fusion** - Merge results using reciprocal rank scores\n3. **Stage 3: Cross-Encoder Reranking** (optional) - Apply neural reranker for top-k results\n\n### 4. Advanced Reranking Techniques for 2025-2026\n\n**Cross-Encoder Reranking:**\n- Apply after initial hybrid retrieval for higher precision\n- Models like **Rank1** and **RankZephyr** show 19-23% improvement over BM25 baselines\n- Use test-time compute for reasoning-based reranking\n\n**Listwise Reranking (Rank-K):**\n- Leverages LLM reasoning capabilities at query time\n- Multilingual support for diverse user queries\n- Provides explainable reasoning chains suitable for RAG integration\n\n**Metadata-Aware Ranking:**\n- Incorporate document metadata (timestamps, source reliability) into ranking\n- Use pre-filter fields to enhance query precision\n\n### 5. Production Optimization Strategies\n\n**Performance Considerations:**\n- **Latency**: Run retrieval methods in parallel, apply RRF asynchronously\n- **Scaling**: Use quantized models for reranking to reduce resource consumption\n- **Caching**: Cache embedding computations for frequently accessed documents\n\n**Recommended Workflow:**\n```python\n# Pseudo-code for production hybrid RAG\ndef hybrid_rag_search(query):\n    # Parallel retrieval\n    bm25_results = bm25_search(query, top_k=100)\n    vector_results = vector_search(embed(query), top_k=100)\n    \n    # RRF fusion (k=60)\n    fused_results = rrf_fusion(bm25_results, vector_results, k=60)\n    \n    # Optional: Cross-encoder reranking on top candidates\n    reranked = cross_encoder_rerank(query, fused_results[:20])\n    \n    return reranked[:5]  # Return top 5 for LLM context\n```\n\n### 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't rely on score-based fusion** - Scores from different systems aren't directly comparable\n2. **Don't skip A/B testing** - Compare hybrid vs. pure vector search on your specific data\n3. **Don't over-retrieve** - Balance recall with latency; reranking 100+ documents adds overhead\n4. **Don't ignore sparse signals** - For e-commerce and specialized domains, keyword matching remains critical\n\n### 7. Evaluation Metrics\n\n- **NDCG@k**: Measures ranking quality\n- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: First relevant result position\n- **Precision@k / Recall@k**: Traditional IR metrics\n- **End-to-end RAG quality**: Measure final LLM response accuracy\n\n### Summary\n\nFor production RAG systems in 2025-2026:\n1. **Use hybrid search** (BM25 + vector) as the foundation\n2. **Apply RRF with k=60** for robust result fusion\n3. **Add cross-encoder reranking** for precision-critical applications\n4. **Choose databases with native hybrid support** (OpenSearch, Weaviate, Azure AI Search)\n5. **Continuously evaluate** with domain-specific benchmarks","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat are the 2025 RAG reranking best practices including hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion for production implementation in 2026?","timestamp":1483},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"RAG reranking best practices 2025 hybrid search Reciprocal Rank Fusion production implementation","numResults":15},"timestamp":4345},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014TuE8oc93GzxJeDwiW9xMt","status":"completed","timestamp":15251},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01E2DmTpg28Cp7ahhKji53ND","status":"completed","timestamp":15251},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the comprehensive web search results, I can now provide a detailed answer about the 2025 RAG reranking best practices including hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion for production implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 2025 RAG Reranking Best Practices with Hybrid Search & Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\n\n### 1.

Production Optimization Strategies\n\n**Performance Considerations:**\n- **Latency**: Run retrieval methods in parallel, apply RRF asynchronously\n- **Scaling**: Use quantized models for reranking to reduce resource consumption\n- **Caching**: Cache embedding computations for frequently accessed documents\n\n**Recommended Workflow:**\n```python\n# Pseudo-code for production hybrid RAG\ndef hybrid_rag_search(query):\n    # Parallel retrieval\n    bm25_results = bm25_search(query, top_k=100)\n    vector_results = vector_search(embed(query), top_k=100)\n    \n    # RRF fusion (k=60)\n    fused_results = rrf_fusion(bm25_results, vector_results, k=60)\n    \n    # Optional: Cross-encoder reranking on top candidates\n    reranked = cross_encoder_rerank(query, fused_results[:20])\n    \n    return reranked[:5]  # Return top 5 for LLM context\n```\n\n### 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't rely on score-based fusion** - Scores from different systems aren't directly comparable\n2. **Don't skip A/B testing** - Compare hybrid vs. pure vector search on your specific data\n3. **Don't over-retrieve** - Balance recall with latency; reranking 100+ documents adds overhead\n4. **Don't ignore sparse signals** - For e-commerce and specialized domains, keyword matching remains critical\n\n### 7. Evaluation Metrics\n\n- **NDCG@k**: Measures ranking quality\n- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: First relevant result position\n- **Precision@k / Recall@k**: Traditional IR metrics\n- **End-to-end RAG quality**: Measure final LLM response accuracy\n\n### Summary\n\nFor production RAG systems in 2025-2026:\n1. **Use hybrid search** (BM25 + vector) as the foundation\n2. **Apply RRF with k=60** for robust result fusion\n3. **Add cross-encoder reranking** for precision-critical applications\n4. **Choose databases with native hybrid support** (OpenSearch, Weaviate, Azure AI Search)\n5. **Continuously evaluate** with domain-specific benchmarks","timestamp":43867}],"duration":44771,"pass":true,"score":0.97,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

Understanding Hybrid Search Architecture\n\nHybrid search combines **vector similarity search** (dense embeddings for semantic understanding) with **keyword-based search** (BM25/TF-IDF for lexical matching). This addresses key limitations of pure vector search:\n\n- **Exact match failures**: Vector search alone struggles with specific names, codes, abbreviations\n- **Semantic similarity limitations**: Keywords like product codes or technical terms need exact matching\n- **Metadata filtering needs**: Production systems require filtering by dates, categories, etc.\n\n### The Hybrid Formula\n```\nH = (1-α)K + αV\n```\nWhere:\n- `K` = Keyword search score\n- `V` = Vector search score  \n- `α` = Balancing parameter (tune based on use case)\n\n## 2. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) - The Core Technique\n\nRRF is the **industry-standard method** for merging search results from multiple retrieval systems without score normalization.\n\n### RRF Formula\n```\nRRF_score(d) = Σ 1 / (k + rank_i(d))\n```\nWhere:\n- `d` = document\n- `k` = smoothing constant (typically 60)\n- `rank_i(d)` = rank of document d in result list i\n\n### Key Advantages of RRF\n\n1. **Stability Across Score Distributions**: Unlike min-max or L2 normalization, RRF focuses on rank positions rather than scores, ensuring consistent treatment across diverse data sources\n\n2. **Resistance to Outliers**: Aggregates rankings rather than scores, preventing extreme values from distorting final relevance\n\n3. **Consistency in Relevance Ranking**: Documents ranking well across multiple queries are favored, enhancing reliability\n\n4. **No Score Normalization Required**: Works with different retrieval systems without complex calibration\n\n## 3.

Retrieval Layer Design\n\n1. **Combine Multiple Retrieval Methods**:\n   - Dense vector search (semantic similarity)\n   - Sparse vector search (BM25, SPLADE)\n   - Full-text search (keyword matching)\n\n2. **Use Appropriate Embedding Strategies**:\n   - **Dense embeddings**: For semantic understanding (OpenAI, Cohere, open-source models)\n   - **Sparse embeddings** (SPLADE): When exact keyword matches are essential\n   - **Hybrid**: Combine both for best of both worlds\n\n### B. RRF Configuration\n\n1. **Smoothing Constant (k) Tuning**:\n   - Default: `k=60` is widely recommended\n   - **Lower k**: More emphasis on top-ranked items (higher precision)\n   - **Higher k**: More emphasis on consensus across lists (higher recall)\n\n2. **Weighted RRF** (Advanced - 2025 Feature):\n   - Elasticsearch and others now support weighted RRF\n   - Assign different weights to retrievers based on query type\n   - Example: Location queries weight proximity higher; technical queries weight keyword search higher\n\n### C.

Database and Infrastructure Choices\n\n1. **Native Hybrid Search Support**:\n   - **Weaviate**: Native hybrid search\n   - **Elasticsearch**: Built-in RRF, weighted RRF\n   - **OpenSearch**: RRF in Neural Search plugin (v2.19+)\n   - **SingleStore**: SQL-based RRF implementation\n   - **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Requires custom implementation\n\n2. **Milvus/Milvus Lite**: \n   - Supports hybrid search and reranking\n   - Built-in BM25 integration\n\n### E.

Valid passport\n2. **Cédula de Extranjería** (required for most accounts)\n3. Valid Colombian visa (Digital Nomad Visa qualifies)\n4. Proof of address in Colombia (utility bill, rental contract)\n5. Proof of income (employment letter, bank statements, payslips)\n6. Colombian Tax Number (NIT/RUT) - sometimes required for significant transactions\n7. Personal or bank references\n8.

Some reports suggest they may occasionally allow non-residents to open accounts with just a passport and RUT number if you've engaged in commercial activities, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n---\n\n### Davivienda Account Requirements\n\n**Documents Needed:**\n1. Valid passport\n2. **Cédula de Extranjería** (required for visa holders over 3 months)\n3. Valid Colombian visa\n4. Proof of address (utility bills, lease agreement)\n5.

Post-Initial Invasion Period (Late 2022-2024):**\n- After the initial invasion phase, Russian advances slowed dramatically\n- According to CSIS analysis, Russia's rate of advance during its fiercest offensives became **15 to 70 meters per day** - slower than WWI's Battle of the Somme\n- Since early 2024, Russia gained **less than 1.5% of Ukrainian territory** despite suffering approximately 1.2 million casualties\n- Peak advances in late 2024 reached about **6 square kilometers per day**, not 40-50 km penetrations\n\n**3. Comparison with Ukrainian Counteroffensives:**\n- Ukraine's **September 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive** achieved advances of **up to 70 km** in just six days, recapturing approximately 3,000-6,000 square kilometers\n- This was described as comparable to historical **Blitzkrieg tactics**\n\n### Historical Comparison\n\nThe CSIS and ISW analyses found that:\n- Russia's current advance rate is **the slowest of any major army in the past century**\n- The advance is slower than Allied progress during **WWI's Battle of the Somme**\n- A Leiden University analysis noted Russia's initial advance rate of 7.8 km/day was actually above the historical average of 2 km/day for heavily engaged forces - but this only applied to the first weeks of the invasion\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The 40-50 km rapid advances only have precedent in the first week of the February 2022 invasion.** Since then, no such rapid advances have occurred.

Stolen funds were quickly converted to WETH and transferred from Base to Ethereum mainnet, then dispersed across multiple addresses to evade detection\n\n**Response:**\n- Arcadia Finance issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding 90% of stolen funds be returned\n- Users were advised to revoke permissions for asset managers\n- The protocol's contracts were paused\n\n**Attacker Identification:**\nBased on my searches, there is **no confirmed evidence** that the attacker was definitively identified by Chainalysis or Elliptic in 2026. While one source (Guardrail.ai) mentions \"the attacker has been traced\" as of 2026, no specific reports from Chainalysis or Elliptic confirming the attacker's identity were found. Chainalysis's 2026 Crypto Crime Report focused on broader scam trends rather than individual incidents like the Arcadia hack. The attacker's identity appears to remain unknown in publicly available information.","timestamp":38981}],"duration":39980,"pass":false,"score":0.57,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

Let me search for more specific 2026 information:\nLet me search for more recent 2026 interviews with Fouquet:\nBased on my comprehensive web search, I can now provide a summary of what ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet has said about the contradiction between US chip export controls on China and ASML's business in interviews in 2026:\n\n## Summary: ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet on US Chip Export Controls and China (2026 Interviews)\n\nIn several 2026 interviews, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet has highlighted key **contradictions and tensions** in US chip export controls affecting ASML's China business:\n\n### Key Statements:\n\n1. **\"Economically Motivated\" Restrictions** (continued position from earlier interviews): Fouquet has maintained that US export restrictions have shifted from being primarily about national security to being \"economically motivated,\" suggesting the rationale has become harder to justify purely on security grounds.\n\n2. **Decoupling is a \"Herculean Task\"** (January 2026, SupplyChains Magazine): Fouquet emphasized that decoupling the global semiconductor supply chain is an \"extremely difficult and expensive\" undertaking, if not entirely unfeasible.

Setup Phase (TD Setup)\n- Identifies momentum shifts and defines price ranges\n- **Buy Setup**: 9 consecutive closes below a close from 4 bars earlier\n- **Sell Setup**: 9 consecutive closes above a close from 4 bars earlier\n- A \"Perfected Setup\" occurs when specific additional conditions are met, indicating a stronger reversal signal\n- The completion of 9 (known as the **9®**) identifies conditions that typically precede price reversals\n\n#### 2. Countdown Phase (TD Countdown)\n- Follows the Setup phase and confirms trend exhaustion\n- Counts from 1 to 13, comparing current closes to previous highs or lows\n- The completion of 13 (known as the **13™**) marks the end of the Countdown phase, indicating trend exhaustion\n- The **9-13®** represents a completed indication combining both phases\n\n### Support and Resistance: TD Setup Trend (TDST)\nA key element for identifying support and resistance is the **TD Setup Trend (TDST)** component, which:\n- Confirms market trends and potential failures\n- Automatically establishes support and resistance levels based on recent price movements\n- Uses the highest high (for bearish setups) or lowest low (for bullish setups) during the setup phase as the key support/resistance level\n\n### Additional DeMark Indicators\n\nTom DeMark has developed over **70 proprietary indicators**, including:\n\n- **TD Combo®**: A more selective version of Sequential with stricter criteria\n- **Absolute Retracement®**: Anticipates price support and resistance during extreme market conditions\n- **DeMarker Oscillator**: Measures buying pressure relative to the previous day\n- **TD Trend Lines**: Automatically draws support and resistance levels based on the setup\n- **Aggressive Sequential®**: Identifies price exhaustion during high volatility with more lenient conditions\n- **Anti-Differential™**: Detects price exhaustion zones by analyzing buying and selling pressure\n\n### Application in 2026\n\nFor traders in 2026, the TD Sequential system provides:\n1. **Systematic reversal identification** - Removes emotional decision-making\n2. **Optimal entry/exit points** - Based on counted price exhaustion\n3. **Risk management levels** - The reversal zone defined by the 13 count establishes specific risk parameters\n4. **Multi-timeframe/multi-market applicability** - Works across stocks, forex, crypto, and all time frames\n\nThe indicators are available on professional platforms like **Bloomberg** and **CQG**, and can also be implemented through modern tools like **TradingView (Pine Script)** and **TrendSpider**.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat is the DeMark indicator and TD Sequential system developed by Tom DeMark for technical analysis support and resistance in 2026?","timestamp":1639},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"DeMark indicator TD Sequential Tom DeMark technical analysis support resistance 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":4016},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01G1CJiyjzrwz8RgDZ4SwfPJ","status":"completed","timestamp":17435},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search, I can provide a comprehensive answer about the DeMark indicator and TD Sequential system developed by Tom DeMark for technical analysis support and resistance.\n\n## The DeMark Indicator and TD Sequential System\n\n### Overview\nThe **TD Sequential** indicator was developed by **Tom DeMark** in the 1970s and remains one of the most sophisticated technical analysis tools for identifying market exhaustion and potential trend reversals.

This event provides several properties:\n\n- **`event.data`**: Contains the contextual data object of the clicked node\n- **`event.itemPath`**: A list of indexes leading to the clicked item\n- **`event.label`**: The displayed text (label) of the clicked item\n\n### Using `event.label`\n\nThe `event.label` property allows you to retrieve the label of the clicked item within your event handler. This enables you to implement specific actions based on user interactions with the tree nodes.\n\n### Configuring the Event\n\nTo configure the `onItemClicked` event:\n\n1. **Select the Component**: Choose the Display Tree component in your project\n2. **Configure Events**: Right-click the component and select \"Configure Events\"\n3. **Choose Event**: Select the `onItemClicked` event from the available events list\n4. **Add Action**: Click the \"Add\" icon to associate an action (such as displaying details or navigating to another view)\n5. **Configure Action**: Set up the action parameters and click \"OK\" to save\n\n### Best Practices\n\nThe documentation recommends using **Script Actions** with the `onItemClicked` event for precise control over actions based on which specific item was clicked. For communication between components, you can use `system.perspective.sendMessage` to send the `event.label` as part of a message payload to Message Handlers, which is more robust than using object traversal paths.\n\n**Sources**: \n- Perspective - Tree Scripting (docs.inductiveautomation.com/docs/8.1/appendix/components)\n- Component Events and Actions (docs.inductiveautomation.com/docs/8.1/ignition-modules/perspective)\n- Perspective - Tree (docs.inductiveautomation.com/docs/8.1/appendix/components/perspective)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat does the Inductive Automation Perspective documentation say about the Display Tree component's onItemClicked event and event.label handler in 2026?","timestamp":1787},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"Inductive Automation Perspective Display Tree component onItemClicked event event.label handler 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":4080},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BEyhEpDmFGBeA9UFLt27FB","status":"completed","timestamp":11016},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the web search results, I can provide you with the information from the Inductive Automation Perspective documentation about the Display Tree component's `onItemClicked` event and `event.label` handler.\n\n## Summary from Inductive Automation Perspective Documentation\n\nAccording to the **Ignition User Manual** documentation for the Perspective Tree component:\n\n### The `onItemClicked` Event\n\nThe `onItemClicked` event for the Perspective Display Tree component triggers whenever a node is clicked.

It provides an asynchronous interface for interacting with the dYdX v4 decentralized exchange.\n\n### Main Modules\n\nThe library consists of **6 main modules**:\n\n1. **`node`** - Node (Validator) Client\n   - Primary module for managing orders and funds\n   - Key structs: `NodeClient`, `Wallet`, `Account`, `OrderBuilder`, `OrderId`, `OrderMarketParams`, `TxBuilder`\n   - Enums: `OrderSide`, `OrderTimeInForce`, `OrderGoodUntil`, `ChainId`, `Authenticator`\n   - Handles transaction broadcasting and error handling\n\n2. **`indexer`** - Indexer Client\n   - For querying the dYdX network (read-only operations)\n   - `IndexerClient` for REST API queries\n   - Real-time data via WebSocket `feed` submodule\n   - Market data, positions, fills, transfers, historical funding, PnL data\n\n3. **`config`** - Client Configuration\n   - Configuration management for different environments (mainnet/testnet)\n\n4. **`faucet`** - Testnet Tokens (optional feature, on by default)\n   - `FaucetClient` for obtaining testnet funds\n\n5. **`noble`** - Noble Client (optional feature, on by default)\n   - `NobleClient` for transferring funds between Noble and dYdX chains\n\n6. **`telemetry`** - Metrics Collection (optional feature, on by default)\n   - Vendor-agnostic metrics via the `metrics` crate\n\n### Trading Order Placement Documentation\n\n#### Order Components\nEach order requires:\n- **Order ID**: Composed of Subaccount ID, Client ID (user-defined 32-bit integer), Order flags, and CLOB Pair ID\n- **Order Flags**: Short-term (`0`), Long-term (`64`), Conditional (`32`), or TWAP (`128`)\n\n#### Order Types and Parameters\n- **Types**: Market, Limit, Stop, Take Profit\n- **Side**: `BUY` or `SELL` (via `OrderSide` enum)\n- **Time in Force**: `OrderTimeInForce` enum for execution conditions\n- **Good Until**: Short-term orders (max 20 blocks ~30 seconds) or Long-term (max 95 days)\n- **Reduce Only**: Boolean for position-reducing orders only\n\n#### Order Placement Workflow (Rust)\n1. Create/configure `NodeClient` with chain configuration\n2. Set up `Wallet` from mnemonic/seed\n3. Fetch market parameters via `IndexerClient` for price/size quantization\n4. Build order using `OrderBuilder` with `OrderMarketParams`\n5. Broadcast order via `NodeClient::place_order()`\n6. Cancel unfilled orders via `NodeClient::cancel_order()`\n\n### Installation\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ndydx = \"0.3.0\"\n```\n\nOr via cargo:\n```bash\ncargo add dydx\n```\n\n### Resources\n- **docs.rs**: https://docs.rs/dydx/latest/dydx\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-clients/tree/main/v4-client-rs\n- **Official Documentation**: https://docs.dydx.xyz/interaction/client/quick-start-rs\n- **Trading Guide**: https://docs.dydx.xyz/interaction/trading","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat are the main modules and trading order placement documentation for the dYdX v4-clients-rs Rust client library in 2026?","timestamp":1566},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"dYdX v4-clients-rs Rust client library modules trading order placement documentation 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":6926},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01P3wUbv1NSQUZxLhuMQNWsT","status":"completed","timestamp":18814},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016K98dJTAVQAFQ8jeYn9Qak","status":"completed","timestamp":18814},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","input":{"url":"https://docs.rs/dydx/latest/dydx"},"timestamp":22367},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BjqHEpeGaHLpHUbwEL9BZL","status":"completed","timestamp":23106},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017dciftCVerjJfMamgmVXRE","status":"completed","timestamp":23106},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01V3snk8HsRXKrGasCAMi5NB","status":"completed","timestamp":23106},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QBWdoVuqzBg3UD4k9rL45L","status":"completed","timestamp":26760},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015TvSMDXUH6yu1SpggnZ3ey","status":"completed","timestamp":26760},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about the dYdX v4-clients-rs Rust client library.\n\n## dYdX v4-clients-rs Rust Client Library - Main Modules and Trading Order Placement Documentation\n\n### Overview\n\nThe dYdX Rust client library (version 0.3.0 as of 2026) is available via the `dydx` crate on crates.io.

Item sent if add-in unavailable. |\n| **Soft Block** | `SoftBlock` | User must address issue before sending. Item sent if add-in unavailable. (Default) |\n| **Block** | `Block` | Item cannot be sent until conditions met, even if add-in unavailable. |\n\n### PromptUser Specific Behavior\n- If conditions aren't met, user sees a dialog with **\"Send Anyway\"** and **\"Don't Send\"** options\n- If add-in is taking too long, user can stop it and choose **\"Send Anyway\"**\n- If add-in is unavailable (error loading), the item **will be sent**\n- **Marketplace publishing**: Add-ins using `PromptUser` or `SoftBlock` can be published to Microsoft Marketplace\n\n### JavaScript Event Handler Requirements\nThe manifest must be paired with a JavaScript handler that:\n1. Implements the handler function (e.g., `onMessageSendHandler`)\n2. Calls `Office.actions.associate()` to map the function name to its implementation\n3. Calls `event.completed()` with appropriate options\n\n```javascript\nfunction onMessageSendHandler(event) {\n  // Your validation logic here\n  \n  // If conditions met:\n  event.completed({ allowEvent: true });\n  \n  // If conditions NOT met:\n  event.completed({ \n    allowEvent: false, \n    errorMessage: \"Your message explaining the issue\",\n    errorMessageMarkdown: \"**Formatted** message with [links](url)\" // req set 1.15+\n  });\n}\n\nOffice.actions.associate(\"onMessageSendHandler\", onMessageSendHandler);\n```\n\n### Supported Clients (2026)\n- **Outlook on the web** (modern UI) - Exchange Online only\n- **New Outlook on Windows** - Exchange Online only  \n- **Classic Outlook on Windows** - Version 2206 (Build 15330.20196)+\n- **Outlook on Mac** - Version 16.65 (22082700)+","timestamp":43789}],"duration":44555,"pass":true,"score":0.96,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

Item is sent if add-in is unavailable. |\n| **SoftBlock** | (Default) User must address the issue before sending, but item is sent if add-in is unavailable. |\n| **Block** | Item is blocked from sending if conditions aren't met OR if add-in is unavailable. |\n\n### 3. **PromptUser Specific Behavior**\nWhen using `SendMode=\"PromptUser\"`:\n- User sees a dialog with **\"Send Anyway\"** and **\"Don't Send\"** options\n- If the add-in takes too long (>5 seconds but <5 minutes), user can stop the add-in and send anyway\n- If the add-in times out (≥5 minutes), user can choose to send without the add-in check\n- If the add-in is unavailable, the item will be sent\n\n### 4. **JavaScript Event Handler Registration**\nYou must call `Office.actions.associate()` to map the handler:\n```javascript\nOffice.actions.associate(\"onMessageSendHandler\", onMessageSendHandler);\n```\n\n### 5. **Event Completion**\nThe handler must call `event.completed()` with options:\n```javascript\nevent.completed({ \n  allowEvent: false,  // true to allow send, false to block\n  errorMessage: \"Plain text message\",\n  errorMessageMarkdown: \"**Formatted** message with [links](url)\" // requires 1.15\n});\n```\n\n### 6. **Runtime Configuration**\n- Classic Outlook on Windows uses JavaScript-only runtime (loads .js file directly)\n- Outlook on web, Mac, and new Windows use browser runtime (loads HTML file with `<script>` tag)\n\n### 7. **Marketplace Publishing Note**\nAdd-ins with `SendMode=\"PromptUser\"` or `SendMode=\"SoftBlock\"` can be published to Microsoft Marketplace. Add-ins using `SendMode=\"Block\"` can only be deployed by organization administrators.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web search and answer\nWhat are the Outlook Add-in manifest XML requirements for LaunchEvents with OnMessageSend and SendMode PromptUser in 2026?","timestamp":2500},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","input":{"query":"Outlook Add-in manifest XML LaunchEvents OnMessageSend SendMode PromptUser requirements 2026","numResults":10},"timestamp":6192},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Kq1r9KnFZhiGy8pGdFq2vr","status":"completed","timestamp":14059},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01FEr1vdAU4AF577rBMiTfFC","status":"completed","timestamp":14059},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","input":{"url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/onmessagesend-onappointmentsend-events"},"timestamp":17433},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019vLfda2JB5x5PgCY1hayXo","status":"completed","timestamp":18406},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Sw2h6JwdvoehKgqeeyHFJe","status":"completed","timestamp":18406},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research of the official Microsoft documentation (updated through January 2026), here are the **Outlook Add-in manifest XML requirements for LaunchEvents with OnMessageSend and SendMode PromptUser**:\n\n## Manifest XML Requirements (Add-in Only Manifest)\n\n### XML Structure for LaunchEvent with OnMessageSend and PromptUser SendMode\n\n```xml\n<VersionOverrides xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides\" xsi:type=\"VersionOverridesV1_0\">\n  <VersionOverrides xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides/1.1\" xsi:type=\"VersionOverridesV1_1\">\n    <Requirements>\n      <bt:Sets DefaultMinVersion=\"1.15\">\n        <bt:Set Name=\"Mailbox\" />\n      </bt:Sets>\n    </Requirements>\n    <Hosts>\n      <Host xsi:type=\"MailHost\">\n        <Runtimes>\n          <!-- HTML file for Outlook on web/Mac/new Windows -->\n          <Runtime resid=\"WebViewRuntime.Url\">\n            <!-- JavaScript file for classic Outlook on Windows -->\n            <Override type=\"javascript\" resid=\"JSRuntime.Url\"/>\n          </Runtime>\n        </Runtimes>\n        <DesktopFormFactor>\n          <ExtensionPoint xsi:type=\"LaunchEvent\">\n            <LaunchEvents>\n              <LaunchEvent Type=\"OnMessageSend\" FunctionName=\"onMessageSendHandler\" SendMode=\"PromptUser\" />\n            </LaunchEvents>\n            <SourceLocation resid=\"WebViewRuntime.Url\"/>\n          </ExtensionPoint>\n        </DesktopFormFactor>\n      </Host>\n    </Hosts>\n    <Resources>\n      <bt:Urls>\n        <bt:Url id=\"WebViewRuntime.Url\" DefaultValue=\"https://localhost:3000/commands.html\" />\n        <bt:Url id=\"JSRuntime.Url\" DefaultValue=\"https://localhost:3000/launchevent.js\" />\n      </bt:Urls>\n    </Resources>\n  </VersionOverrides>\n</VersionOverrides>\n```\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n### 1. **Requirement Set Version**\n- The `OnMessageSend` event requires **Mailbox requirement set 1.12** minimum\n- For full Smart Alerts features (including Markdown error messages and send mode override), use **requirement set 1.15**\n\n### 2. **SendMode Options**\nThe `SendMode` attribute supports three values:\n\n| SendMode | Behavior |\n|----------|----------|\n| **PromptUser** | User can choose \"Send Anyway\" if conditions aren't met, or address the issue.

for messages, `OnAppointmentSend` for appointments |\n| **ExtensionPoint xsi:type** | Must be `\"LaunchEvent\"` |\n| **Runtime Override** | Required for classic Outlook on Windows (JavaScript-only runtime) |\n\n### SendMode \"PromptUser\" Behavior\n\nWhen `SendMode=\"PromptUser\"`:\n- If the item doesn't meet add-in conditions, user sees **\"Send Anyway\"** and **\"Don't Send\"** options\n- If add-in takes too long, user can choose to stop the add-in and send anyway\n- If add-in is unavailable (error loading), the item **will be sent** anyway\n- Best for: Non-mandatory conditions, recommendations to users\n\n### JavaScript Handler Requirement\n\nYou must call `Office.actions.associate()` in your JavaScript file to map the manifest function name to its handler:\n\n```javascript\nfunction onMessageSendHandler(event) {\n  // Your validation logic here\n  event.completed({ \n    allowEvent: true,  // or false to block with message\n    errorMessage:

OnMessageSend), but **1.15 recommended** for latest Smart Alerts enhancements |\n| **SendMode Options** | `PromptUser`, `SoftBlock` (default), or `Block` |\n| **LaunchEvent Type** | `OnMessageSend` for messages, `OnAppointmentSend` for appointments |\n| **ExtensionPoint xsi:type** | Must be `\"LaunchEvent\"` |\n| **Runtime Override** | Required for classic Outlook on Windows (JavaScript-only runtime) |\n\n### SendMode \"PromptUser\" Behavior\n\nWhen `SendMode=\"PromptUser\"`:\n- If the item doesn't meet add-in conditions, user sees **\"Send Anyway\"** and **\"Don't Send\"** options\n- If add-in takes too long, user can choose to stop the add-in and send anyway\n- If add-in is unavailable (error loading), the item **will be sent** anyway\n- Best for: Non-mandatory conditions, recommendations to users\n\n### JavaScript Handler Requirement\n\nYou must call `Office.actions.associate()` in your JavaScript file to map the manifest function name to its handler:\n\n```javascript\nfunction onMessageSendHandler(event) {\n  // Your validation logic here\n  event.completed({ \n    allowEvent: true,  // or false to block with message\n    errorMessage: \"Your message here\"\n  });\n}\n\nOffice.actions.associate(\"onMessageSendHandler\", onMessageSendHandler);\n```\n\n### Unified Manifest for Microsoft 365 (JSON Alternative)\n\nFor the newer unified manifest format, use:\n- Event type: `\"messageSending\"` (instead of `OnMessageSend`)\n- SendMode: `\"promptUser\"` (lowercase in JSON)\n- Configured in `\"autoRunEvents\"` array within `\"extensions\"`","timestamp":39373}],"duration":40179,"pass":true,"score":0.98,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

`pe.BeginPlot(progressDialog, null)` | Initializes the plotting process with a progress dialog |\n| `pe.BeginDocument(plotInfo, docName, null, copies, plotToFile, outputPath)` | Starts a new document in the plot job |\n| `pe.BeginPage(pageInfo, plotInfo, isLastPage, null)` | Begins a new page/sheet |\n| `pe.BeginGenerateGraphics(null)` | Starts generating plot graphics |\n| `pe.EndGenerateGraphics(null)` | Finishes generating graphics |\n| `pe.EndPage(null)` | Completes the current page |\n| `pe.EndDocument(null)` | Finalizes the document |\n| `pe.EndPlot(null)` | Completes the entire plot job |\n\n### Important Tips\n\n1. **Check Plot State**: Always verify `PlotFactory.ProcessPlotState == ProcessPlotState.NotPlotting` before starting\n2. **Background Plotting**: Set `BACKGROUNDPLOT` system variable to 0 for sequential plotting\n3. **Document Locking**: When plotting non-current documents, use `Document.LockDocument()`\n4. **Multi-sheet Drivers**: Use DWFx or PDF drivers that support multi-sheet output\n5. **Validation**: Always validate PlotInfo using `PlotInfoValidator` before plotting","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use web

`pe.BeginPlot(progressDialog, null)` | Initializes the plotting process with a progress dialog |\n| `pe.BeginDocument(plotInfo, docName, null, copies, plotToFile, outputPath)` | Starts a new document in the plot job |\n| `pe.BeginPage(pageInfo, plotInfo, isLastPage, null)` | Begins a new page/sheet |\n| `pe.BeginGenerateGraphics(null)` | Starts generating plot graphics |\n| `pe.EndGenerateGraphics(null)` | Finishes generating graphics |\n| `pe.EndPage(null)` | Completes the current page |\n| `pe.EndDocument(null)` | Finalizes the document |\n| `pe.EndPlot(null)` | Completes the entire plot job |\n\n### Important Tips\n\n1. **Check Plot State**: Always verify `PlotFactory.ProcessPlotState == ProcessPlotState.NotPlotting` before starting\n2. **Background Plotting**: Set `BACKGROUNDPLOT` system variable to 0 for sequential plotting\n3. **Document Locking**: When plotting non-current documents, use `Document.LockDocument()`\n4. **Multi-sheet Drivers**: Use DWFx or PDF drivers that support multi-sheet output\n5. **Validation**: Always validate PlotInfo using `PlotInfoValidator` before plotting","timestamp":56657}],"duration":57684,"pass":true,"score":0.99,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 50/50 (basic=10, tools=5, multiTool=5, depth=5, clean=25).

security issues\n\n## 8. **Use HTTPS for All Communications**\n- Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit\n- Protect tokens from interception during transmission\n\n## 9. **Prevent Token Leakage**\n- Ensure tokens are not exposed in URLs, logs, or indexed by search engines\n- Use appropriate `Referrer-Policy` headers (e.g., `no-referrer` or `origin-when-cross-origin`)\n- Configure apps to prevent search engine indexing of pages with token access\n\n## 10. **Token Expiration Policies**\n- If tokens are publicly accessible (e.g., in URLs), set expiration dates no longer than 7 days\n- Delegate tokens should have explicit expiration times set\n\n## 11. **Server-Side Storage Only**\n- Keep access tokens on the server-side only\n- Never expose tokens to client-side environments or browsers\n\nThese best practices align with Shopify's official documentation and community recommendations for the Admin API version

Specifically, increased activity on these pages often precedes significant stock market movements.\n\n3. **Interpretation**: The researchers suggest this pattern reflects **information-gathering behavior** by investors prior to making trading decisions.
