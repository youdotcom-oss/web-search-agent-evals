([github.com](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3) Checkov — production baseline exception management**\n- **Config file** (`.checkov.yml` or `.checkov.yaml`) is the preferred baseline for skip lists and other settings; Checkov searches in specific locations or you can force it with `--config-file`. ([github.com](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov?utm_source=openai))\n- **Skip checks** for baseline exceptions (`skip-check`) and **inline suppressions** for resource‑level exceptions. ([github.com](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov?utm_source=openai))\n\nExample `.checkov.yml`:\n```yaml\nskip-check:\n  - CKV_AWS_20\n  - CKV_AWS_52\n```\n\nInline suppression (resource‑level, with justification):\n```hcl\n# checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:public bucket required for static site; WAF + logging enforced\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"site\" {\n  # ...\n}\n```\nInline skip syntax is documented in Checkov’s suppression guidance. ([checkov.io](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4) Production governance model (recommended)**\n- **Central exceptions registry** (YAML/JSON) committed via PR, with security approval required.\n- **Expiry required** for every exception (90–180 days is common); automation fails the build when expired.\n- **Environment scoping**: baseline exceptions for **prod only**; dev/test may allow broader skips but should not silently leak into prod.\n- **“Smallest blast radius”**: prefer inline suppressions over global skip lists if only a single resource needs it.\n- **Auditability**: include ticket IDs and compensating controls in inline suppressions.\n\n**5) Suggested pipeline pattern**\n- **Stage 1 (PR):** run with full checks; allow inline suppressions but **disallow global skip changes** without security review.\n- **Stage 2 (main/prod):** apply **locked baseline config** (tfsec config / `.checkov.yml`) and fail on expired exceptions.\n\nIf you want, tell me your current CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, etc.) and I can draft exact pipeline snippets and a reviewable exceptions registry format.","timestamp":44674}],"duration":44674,"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-232","input":"What do I need to know about the vvb2060 IMS Android app for IMS VoLTE in 2026?","k":5,"trials":[{"trialNum":1,"output":"Here’s the practical 2026 snapshot for the **vvb2060 IMS** Android app (often called “IMS” or “Pixel IMS”) used to enable VoLTE/IMS features. If you meant a different app or device family, tell me your device/carrier and I’ll tailor it.\n\n**What it is (and who it’s for)**\n- It’s an unofficial IMS configuration tool originally by vvb2060, primarily aimed at **Google Pixel** devices to flip carrier‑config flags for VoLTE/VoWiFi/VoNR when the carrier or region doesn’t officially support them. ([github.com](https://github.com/vvb2060/Ims))\n- Popular forks like **TurboIMS** explicitly target Pixels and rely on Shizuku + privileged config access. ([github.com](https://github.com/Turbo1123/TurboIMS?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Current status (important for 2026)**\n- The upstream **vvb2060/Ims** repo is **archived** (read‑only) as of **Dec 18, 2025**, and the latest release shown there is **v3.0** dated **Dec 18, 2025**. That means no official upstream fixes unless a new repo appears. ([github.com](https://github.com/vvb2060/Ims))\n- Forks (e.g., TurboIMS) continue development and are the most likely place for fixes if Google/Android changes break things. ([github.com](https://github.com/Turbo1123/TurboIMS?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Why it breaks (and why it may keep breaking)**\n- Google has already patched a loophole in late‑2025 that these tools used to override carrier configs, which **broke** the app on some updates. That pattern is likely to continue in 2026 as Android security hardens privileged APIs. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))\n- Expect **update-by-update volatility**: a monthly security patch can make the app crash or stop applying changes, and fixes may require new builds or different workarounds.\n\n**Common behavior in 2026**\n- Many users report **non‑persistent toggles** (VoLTE flips off after reboot), or that toggles work only after restarting Shizuku or using a “hotfix” build. This is consistent with community reports around late‑2025/early‑2026. ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com//r/GooglePixel/comments/1o1z17c/psa_october_update_breaks_pixel_ims_app_that_adds/?utm_source=openai))\n- The app **does not guarantee carrier provisioning**. Even if the toggle appears, the network can still block IMS registration.\n\n**Security / safety / compliance notes**\n- It uses privileged configuration access (often via **Shizuku**), which is why it’s fragile and why Google patches it. That can be a **security trade‑off** and may violate carrier terms or regional rules. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))\n- Some alternatives for rooted devices exist (e.g., Magisk modules) that modify carrier config files; these can be more persistent but require root. ([github.com](https://github.com/cxOrz/pixel_ims_module?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Bottom line for 2026**\n- The original vvb2060 app is effectively **legacy** (archived). If you rely on it, plan for **breakage after updates**, and be ready to switch to a maintained fork (like TurboIMS) or a root‑based solution. ([github.com](https://github.com/vvb2060/Ims))\n- If your carrier supports VoLTE officially, the safest path is still to get official provisioning; otherwise, this remains a best‑effort hack.\n\nIf you want a **specific recommendation**, tell me:\n- phone model\n- Android version/build\n- carrier and country\n- rooted or non‑rooted\n- whether VoWiFi/VoNR also matters","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Here’s the practical 2026 snapshot for the **vvb2060 IMS** Android app (often called “IMS” or “Pixel IMS”) used to enable VoLTE/IMS features.

([github.com](https://github.com/Turbo1123/TurboIMS?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Why it breaks (and why it may keep breaking)**\n- Google has already patched a loophole in late‑2025 that these tools used to override carrier configs, which **broke** the app on some updates. That pattern is likely to continue in 2026 as Android security hardens privileged APIs. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))\n- Expect **update-by-update volatility**: a monthly security patch can make the app crash or stop applying changes, and fixes may require new builds or different workarounds.\n\n**Common behavior in 2026**\n- Many users report **non‑persistent toggles** (VoLTE flips off after reboot), or that toggles work only after restarting Shizuku or using a “hotfix” build. This is consistent with community reports around late‑2025/early‑2026. ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com//r/GooglePixel/comments/1o1z17c/psa_october_update_breaks_pixel_ims_app_that_adds/?utm_source=openai))\n- The app **does not guarantee carrier provisioning**. Even if the toggle appears, the network can still block IMS registration.\n\n**Security / safety / compliance notes**\n- It uses privileged configuration access (often via **Shizuku**), which is why it’s fragile and why Google patches it. That can be a **security trade‑off** and may violate carrier terms or regional rules. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/?utm_source=openai))\n- Some alternatives for rooted devices exist (e.g., Magisk modules) that modify carrier config files; these can be more persistent but require root. ([github.com](https://github.com/cxOrz/pixel_ims_module?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Bottom line for 2026**\n- The original vvb2060 app is effectively **legacy** (archived). If you rely on it, plan for **breakage after updates**, and be ready to switch to a maintained fork (like TurboIMS) or a root‑based solution. ([github.com](https://github.com/vvb2060/Ims))\n- If your carrier supports VoLTE officially, the safest path is still to get official provisioning; otherwise, this remains a best‑effort hack.\n\nIf you want a **specific recommendation**, tell me:\n- phone model\n- Android version/build\n- carrier and country\n- rooted or non‑rooted\n- whether VoWiFi/VoNR also matters","timestamp":36753}],"duration":36753,"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

Below is a concise, source-backed checklist that reflects what leading platforms and standards were emphasizing by late‑2025.\n\n**Core design principles**\n- Build **idempotent, retry‑safe tasks** and avoid partial writes; retries should not duplicate or corrupt outputs. Airflow’s best‑practices emphasize transactional task behavior and safe retries. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- Assume **distributed execution**: don’t rely on local disk for handoffs; pass small metadata and store large data in shared storage. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- Favor **modular pipelines**: keep ingestion, transformation, and serving separable so each can scale and evolve independently.\n\n**Ingestion & change management**\n- Prefer **incremental/CDC patterns** when possible; schedule full reloads only when necessary.  \n- For ELT workflows, use **source freshness checks** to avoid rebuilding models against stale inputs and to trigger downstream work only when sources update. dbt’s source freshness guidance and state‑aware orchestration point to this pattern. ([docs.getdbt.com](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Storage & performance**\n- Use **columnar formats** (Parquet/ORC), compression, and partitioning; optimize scale decisions based on workload profiles. AWS’s ETL guidance highlights these as fundamental performance/cost levers. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/serverless-etl-aws-glue/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- Monitor resource utilization and tune scaling rather than blindly increasing compute. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/serverless-etl-aws-glue/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Transformation quality & testing**\n- Treat data as code: **automate tests** (schema, range, uniqueness, nulls) and make failures visible to developers. dbt and Great Expectations provide built‑in mechanisms for test execution and freshness validation. ([docs.getdbt.com](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests?utm_source=openai))  \n- Publish **human‑readable data quality docs** so stakeholders can inspect expectations and validation results.

([docs.greatexpectations.io](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/0.18/reference/learn/terms/data_docs/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Observability & lineage**\n- Implement **standardized lineage collection**. OpenLineage is the de‑facto open standard for lineage events across jobs, datasets, and runs. ([openlineage.io](https://openlineage.io/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Use cloud catalog tooling that can **ingest OpenLineage events** (e.g., GCP Dataplex, AWS DataZone) for governance and impact analysis.

Airflow explicitly recommends transaction‑like tasks, UPSERTs instead of INSERTs on retries, and reading/writing fixed partitions rather than “latest” data. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Treat tasks as atomic units that either complete fully or leave no partial output. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2) Build in testability and deployability**\n- Use pipeline patterns that explicitly improve testability and observability (e.g., template‑based or reusable pipeline definitions) and validate with staged runs before production. Google’s Dataflow best‑practices emphasize observability/testability as first‑order design goals. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/pipeline-best-practices?utm_source=openai))\n- Parameterize environment‑specific settings (paths, connections, schemas) so the same code runs in dev/stage/prod without edits. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.0.1/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3) Standardize data contracts and schemas**\n- Formalize producer/consumer expectations with data contracts (schema, SLAs, quality rules). The Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS) defines sections for schema, data quality, SLAs, and support responsibilities. ([github.com](https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard?utm_source=openai))\n- Pair contracts with schema versioning and change management (breaking vs backward‑compatible changes), and enforce contract checks in CI/CD.\n\n**4) Shift left on data quality**\n- Implement automated, codified data quality checks at ingestion and after transforms (nulls, uniqueness, ranges, referential integrity, distribution drift). Great Expectations’ “expectation suites” embody this model of testable data assertions. ([legacy.017.docs.greatexpectations.io](https://legacy.017.docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/cloud/expectation_suites/manage_expectation_suites/?utm_source=openai))\n- Consider complementary rule‑based checks and anomaly monitoring. SodaCL illustrates how YAML‑based checks can be versioned and run in pipelines. ([docs.soda.io](https://docs.soda.io/soda-cl/metrics-and-checks.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5) Observability and lineage as first‑class features**\n- Capture lineage events consistently and centrally. OpenLineage provides an open standard for lineage metadata (jobs, runs, datasets) that tools can emit and consumers can aggregate. ([openlineage.io](https://openlineage.io/docs?utm_source=openai))\n- Ensure your catalog or governance layer records lineage and classifications; AWS’s Analytics Lens explicitly calls out data lineage and classification in catalogs as best practice. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/analytics-lens/best-practice-3.5---record-data-classifications-into-the-data-catalog-so-that-analytics-workloads-can-understand..html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**6) Orchestration and operational hygiene**\n- Follow orchestration best practices: isolate config/secrets, avoid local filesystem state across tasks, and use shared storage for task outputs. Airflow highlights these operational constraints to keep tasks reliable at scale. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Add self‑checks or “assert” tasks to validate outputs (existence, row counts, key partitions). Airflow 3.x docs recommend self‑checks between tasks. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.0.1/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**7) Reliability patterns for incremental data**\n- Prefer incremental loads and CDC where appropriate; combine with durable checkpoints, late‑arrival handling, and backfill strategies (not a single “best tool,” but a consistent pattern).\n- Use immutable raw landing zones (bronze layer), then curated layers for clean/aggregated data. This layered approach is a common modern pattern (often called medallion).\n\n**8) Governance, security, and compliance**\n- Tag sensitive fields and enforce access controls via data catalog metadata and lineage records. AWS recommends classification tagging to support policy enforcement and auditability. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/analytics-lens/best-practice-3.5---record-data-classifications-into-the-data-catalog-so-that-analytics-workloads-can-understand..html?utm_source=openai))\n- Track who ran what, when, and why; Microsoft Fabric’s pipeline guidance emphasizes audit trails, error handling, and monitoring as baseline practices. ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/pipeline-overview?utm_source=openai))\n\n**9) CI/CD, versioning, and reproducibility**\n- Treat ETL code, configs, and quality rules as versioned artifacts; enforce peer review, automated tests, and repeatable deployments.\n- Ensure reproducible runs with fixed inputs (partitioned data) and immutable dependencies.\n\n**10) Performance and cost controls**\n- Partition and compact files, avoid tiny‑file pathologies, and tune compute for throughput vs latency.\n- Monitor pipeline runtimes, retries, and data freshness; fix performance regressions quickly (observability metrics should include SLAs, runtimes, error rates, throughput).\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can tailor this to your stack (e.g., Airflow + dbt + Snowflake, Spark + Delta Lake, or Fabric/ADF) and map each best practice to concrete implementation steps and tool choices.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Below is a concise, up‑to‑date (as of October 2025) checklist of ETL pipeline best practices, with sources limited to materials published on or before Oct 2025 where dated.\n\n**1) Design for repeatability and deterministic outputs**\n- Make every task idempotent; avoid non‑deterministic reads/writes and time‑dependent logic so retries produce identical results.

This layered approach is a common modern pattern (often called medallion).\n\n**8) Governance, security, and compliance**\n- Tag sensitive fields and enforce access controls via data catalog metadata and lineage records.

This reduces ambiguous boxes and false positives.  \n- Add clinical context when it changes appearance (contrast phase, modality, typical size range).

Use explicit “exclude” rules (e.g., “ignore labels, rulers, metal implants, and scan annotations”). This pattern aligns with Vertex AI best‑practice guidance on clear instructions and task scoping.

Bounding box detection is prompt‑driven, so explicitly calling out expected variations helps the model generalize. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**6) Control box granularity explicitly**  \n- State whether you want tight boxes around lesions vs. region‑level boxes. Add minimum size thresholds (“only lesions ≥ 5 mm”) to avoid tiny, clinically irrelevant detections. This mirrors data‑quality constraints seen in object‑detection guidance.

I’ll anchor the guidance to current Vertex AI/Gemini docs and call out what’s unique for medical images.\n\n**1) Start with the correct Vertex AI capability and output schema**\n- If you’re using **Gemini‑based bounding box detection** on Vertex AI, the model expects prompts + images and can return **normalized boxes** (often `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` scaled to **0–1000**). This affects how you ask for output and how you post‑process. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection?utm_source=openai))  \n- If you’re using **Vertex AI Vision / AutoML object detection**, the box formats differ (e.g., normalized floats in `[0,1]` or array ordering like `[xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax]`). Your prompt and downstream parser must match the specific API. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/object-detector-model?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**2) Make the prompt *diagnostic‑grade precise***  \nMedical images are noisy, grayscale, and low‑contrast. Prompts must remove ambiguity:\n- **Define target anatomy/pathology exactly** (e.g., “all pulmonary nodules ≥ 3 mm in lung windows”) and specify how to treat artifacts, implants, or overlapping structures.\n- **Specify the output**: labels, coordinate ordering, normalization scale, and any max object count. The Vertex AI bounding‑box doc explicitly encourages this. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection?utm_source=openai))  \n- Use **explicit exclusion** (“ignore ribs, vessels, pleural thickening”) to reduce false positives.

([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/design-multimodal-prompts?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**3) Use strict output constraints and schemas**\n- Ask for **JSON with a fixed schema**, and set `response_mime_type=\"application/json\"` plus a schema if your SDK supports it. The bounding‑box example on Vertex AI uses schema‑validated output. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection?utm_source=openai))  \n- Constrain **max objects** and require **unique labels** when needed (e.g., “each lesion gets unique label by location”).

([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**4) Add medical‑imaging‑specific context inside the prompt**\n- **Modality & windowing**: “CT, lung window; sagittal slice” or “MRI T2‑weighted axial” materially changes how the model interprets the image.  \n- **Expected size/shape**: “lesions are round/ovoid, 3–20 mm”; “exclude linear structures.”  \n- **Anatomical region**: “only within liver parenchyma; ignore kidney/spleen.”  \nThis is an application of the “use specific instructions” principle for multimodal prompts.

Put that in the prompt to prevent format drift. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection?utm_source=openai))  \n- AutoML / Vision output formats differ (e.g., `[xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax]` or normalized bounding boxes).
