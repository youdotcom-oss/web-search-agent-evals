{"id":"websearch-49","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026\nDeploying a GPT model\n to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026 will involve leveraging the Pulumi Azure Native provider to program\nmatically define and create the necessary cloud resources. While the exact Pulumi resource types and properties may evolve by 202\n6, we can project a likely approach based on the current Azure AI Foundry capabilities and the structure of the Pulumi Azure\n provider.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how you would likely deploy a GPT model to Azure AI Foundry with\n Pulumi in 2026:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, you will need to have the following set\n up:\n\n*   **An Azure Account:** You'll need an active Azure subscription.\n*   **Pulumi Account\n and CLI:** Install the Pulumi CLI and set up a Pulumi account.\n*   **Node.js and\n TypeScript:** The example below uses TypeScript, so you'll need Node.js installed.\n*   **Azure CLI:**\n You will need the Azure CLI to log in to your Azure account.\n\n### Step 1: Set up your Pulumi project\n\n\nFirst, create a new Pulumi project:\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir pulumi-azure-ai-foundry &&\n cd pulumi-azure-ai-foundry\npulumi new azure-typescript\n\n```\n\n\nThis will create a new Pul\numi project with the necessary files.\n\n### Step 2: Write the Pulumi code to deploy the model\n\nYou\n will write your infrastructure-as-code in `index.ts`. The following program demonstrates how you would define the resources\n needed to deploy a GPT model. This code is based on the patterns seen in the Azure CLI for deploying models to AI Foundry\n and assumes a similar structure will be available in the Pulumi Azure Native provider.\n\n\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from\n \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// Create an\n Azure Resource Group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"ai-foundry-rg\");\n\n//\n Create an Azure AI Foundry Cognitive Services Account\nconst cognitiveServicesAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"ai-\nfoundry-account\", {\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\", // Specify\n the kind of account for AI Foundry\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\", // Choose the appropriate SKU\n\n    },\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    properties: {\n        // Additional properties can be set\n here if needed\n    },\n});\n\n// Deploy a GPT model to the Cognitive Services Account\nconst modelDeployment = new\n azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-model-deployment\", {\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n\n    accountName: cognitiveServicesAccount.name,\n    deploymentName: \"MyGPT5Model\", // The\n name for your deployment\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            name: \"gpt-5\", // The\n name of the model to deploy (e.g., gpt-5)\n            version: \"2026-0\n1-01\", // Specify the model version\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n        },\n    },\n    sku\n: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 1,\n    },\n});\n\n// Export\n the endpoint of the deployed model\nexport const endpoint = pulumi.interpolate`${cognitiveServicesAccount.properties.endpoint}deploy\nments/${modelDeployment.name}`;\n\n```\n\n\n### Step 3: Deploy the infrastructure\n\nRun the following command to deploy your\n GPT model:\n\n\n```bash\npulumi up\n```\n\n\nPulumi will show you a preview of the resources that will be created.\n Confirm the deployment to proceed. Once the deployment is complete, Pulumi will output the endpoint of your deployed model.\n\n### Explanation\n of the Pulumi code\n\n*   **Resource Group:** We start by creating a standard Azure Resource Group to hold our AI\n Foundry resources.\n*   **Cognitive Services Account:** This is the central resource for Azure AI services. We specify\n the `kind` as `\"OpenAI\"` to indicate that we are creating an account compatible with AI Foundry and OpenAI models.\n\n*   **Model Deployment:** This is the core resource that represents the deployed GPT model.\n    *   `account\nName`: We associate the deployment with the Cognitive Services Account created earlier.\n    *   `deploymentName`: This is a custom\n name you give to your model deployment.\n    *   `properties.model.name`: Here, you specify the\n name of the GPT model you want to deploy, such as `\"gpt-5\"`. The search results indicate that newer\n models like GPT-5.2 will also be available.\n    *   `sku`: You can specify the SKU\n and capacity for your deployment, which will determine the performance and cost.\n*   **Endpoint Export:** After the deployment, we\n export the model's endpoint URL, which you can then use in your applications to interact with the model.\n\n### Important\n Considerations for 2026\n\n*   **Evolving Resources:** The exact names and properties of the Pulumi\n resources for Azure AI Foundry may be different in 2026. Always refer to the official Pulumi Azure Native\n provider documentation for the most up-to-date information.\n*   **Model Availability:** The availability of specific GPT\n models and their versions will change. Check the Azure AI Foundry model catalog in the Azure portal for the latest list of available models.\n\n*   **Authentication and Authorization:** The code example focuses on deployment. In a real-world scenario, you would also\n need to manage authentication and authorization, likely using Azure Active Directory service principals and assigning them appropriate roles.\n\nThis guide provides a solid\n projection of how to deploy a GPT model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026. By following\n this structure and keeping an eye on the official documentation, you will be well-equipped to automate your AI model deployments.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","timestamp":26995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":26995},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769681040390-fce7a1015fcca","status":"completed","timestamp":26995},{"type":"message","content":"Deploying a GPT model","timestamp":26995},{"type":"message","content":" to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026 will involve leveraging the Pulumi Azure Native provider to program","timestamp":26995},{"type":"message","content":"matically define and create the necessary cloud resources.

{"id":"websearch-88","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?\nIn\n LangGraph, as of 2026, memory state management and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context\n injection are handled through a combination of state management, checkpointers for persistence, and the creation of \"agentic\" R\nAG systems. Here's a breakdown of how to handle each:\n\n### Memory State Management\n\nLangGraph's memory\n is managed through a `State` object that is passed between the nodes in your graph. This state can be persisted to\n enable both short-term and long-term memory.\n\n**1. Short-Term Memory:**\n\nShort-term memory is\n handled within a single conversation thread. It's managed as part of the agent's state and is persisted using **\ncheckpointers**. This allows the graph to be paused and resumed without losing the current state of the conversation.\n\nYou can use various check\npointers depending on your needs:\n\n*   **`InMemorySaver`**: For in-memory, non-persistent storage.\n\n*   **`SqliteSaver`**: To persist the state to a SQLite database.\n*   **\n`PostgresSaver`**: To persist the state to a PostgreSQL database.\n*   **MongoDB Atlas**: For more scalable\n, production-ready long-term memory.\n\n**Example of setting up a checkpointer:**\n\n\n```python\nfrom lang\ngraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\n\nmemory = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(\":memory:\")\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Long-Term Memory:**\n\nLong-term memory allows the agent to recall information across multiple conversation threads. This\n is useful for remembering user preferences or information from past interactions. LangGraph supports this through **stores**, with MongoDB being a common\n choice for production systems.\n\n**3. Defining the State:**\n\nThe structure of your agent's memory is defined using Python\n's `TypedDict`. This allows you to specify the data types of the information you want to store.\n\n**\nExample of a state definition:**\n\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List\nfrom langchain_core.messages\n import AnyMessage\nimport operator\n\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[List[AnyMessage\n], operator.add]\n    # Add other memory elements here, e.g., user_info, retrieved_documents\n\n\n```\n\n\n### RAG Context Injection\n\nIn LangGraph, RAG is best implemented as an \"agentic\" process\n. Instead of a static pipeline, you build a graph that can intelligently decide when to retrieve information and what to do with it.\n\n\n**1. Create a Retriever Tool:**\n\nFirst, you create a retriever from your vector store (e.g., FA\nISS, Chroma, Pinecone) and wrap it as a \"tool\" that your agent can use.\n\n\n```python\n\nfrom langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\n\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\n# Assuming you have a vector store populated with your documents\nvectorstore = FAISS.\nfrom_texts([\"Your documents here\"], embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())\nretriever = vectorstore.as_\nretriever()\n\nretriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(\n    retriever,\n    \"\nretrieve_context\",\n    \"Searches and returns relevant context.\",\n)\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Inject Context\n into the State:**\n\nWhen the agent decides to use the retriever tool, the retrieved documents are added to the graph's state\n. You'll need to add a key to your `AgentState` to hold this information.\n\n\n```python\nclass Agent\nState(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[List[AnyMessage], operator.add]\n    retrieved\n_documents: List[str] # Or a more specific type\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Use Conditional Edges for Agent\nic Behavior:**\n\nYou can use conditional edges in your graph to decide whether to call the retriever tool or to respond directly to the user\n. This decision is typically made by an LLM based on the conversation history.\n\n**Example of a conditional edge:**\n\n\n```python\n\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition\n\ndef\n should_retrieve(state):\n    # Logic to decide if retrieval is necessary\n    # ...\n    if \"tool\n_calls\" in state[\"messages\"][-1].additional_kwargs:\n        return \"retrieve\"\n    return\n \"end\"\n\n# In your graph definition\nworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)\n# ... add nodes for\n agent, retriever, etc. ...\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"agent\",\n    should_\nretrieve,\n    {\n        \"retrieve\": \"retriever_tool_node\",\n        \"end\": END\n,\n    },\n)\n\n```\n\n\nBy combining these concepts, you can build sophisticated LangGraph applications that manage both\n short-term and long-term memory, and intelligently inject context from a RAG system to provide more accurate and relevant responses\n.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","timestamp":30445},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":30445},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769681113949-2bd89973dca2","status":"completed","timestamp":30445},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769681119943-4d75c5925e7f8","status":"completed","timestamp":30445},{"type":"message","content":"In","timestamp":30445},{"type":"message","content":" LangGraph, as of 2026, memory state management and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context","timestamp":30445},{"type":"message","content":" injection are handled through a combination of state management, checkpointers for persistence, and the creation of \"agentic\" R","timestamp":30445},{"type":"message","content":"AG systems.

To\n prevent this, you need to configure Docker to not manipulate `iptables` and then configure UFW to manage Docker'\ns network traffic.\n\nHere are the steps to stop Docker from bypassing the UFW firewall:\n\n### 1. Disable\n Docker's `iptables` Manipulation\n\nEdit the Docker daemon configuration file at `/etc/docker/daemon.json\n`. If this file doesn't exist, create it. Add the following content to the file:\n\n\n```json\n{\n\n  \"iptables\": false\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThis change will prevent Docker from automatically creating `iptables` rules\n that bypass UFW.\n\n### 2. Restart the Docker Daemon\n\nFor the changes to take effect, you must\n restart the Docker service:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n\n### 3. Configure UFW to Forward\n Docker Traffic\n\nYou need to allow traffic forwarding for Docker's network bridge. Edit the UFW configuration file at `/etc/default\n/ufw` and set the `DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY` to `\"ACCEPT\"`:\n\n\n```\nDEFAULT_FORWARD_\nPOLICY=\"ACCEPT\"\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Manually Add `iptables` Rules for Docker\n\nSince Docker is\n no longer managing `iptables`, you will need to add the necessary rules manually to allow container networking while still respecting UFW'\ns policies. You can use the `DOCKER-USER` chain to add custom filtering rules. Docker processes this\n chain before its own rules, allowing you to control traffic.\n\n### 5. Reload UFW\n\nFinally, reload U\nFW to apply the new configuration:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure\n that your Docker containers do not bypass your UFW firewall rules.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?","timestamp":22099},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":22099},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769681428200-0eaa3e8aa36568","status":"completed","timestamp":22099},{"type":"message","content":"By default, Docker modifies `iptables` directly, which allows it to bypass UFW rules.

Here's a breakdown of the key distinctions:\n\n### **1. Support Lifecycle and Security**\n\n*   **.\nNET Framework 4.5.2 (Unsupported):** Support for .NET Framework 4.5.2 ended on\n **April 26, 2022**. By 2025, it will have been unsupported\n for several years. This is the most critical difference, as it means applications running on this version will not receive security updates, leaving\n them vulnerable to potential exploits.\n\n*   **.NET Framework 4.8 (Supported):** .NET Framework 4\n.8 is the final version of the .NET Framework and is considered a component of the Windows operating system. Its support lifecycle\n is tied to the OS it's installed on. Microsoft has stated it will be supported for as long as the underlying Windows\n version is supported, which for many versions extends well beyond 2025. In 2025, .\nNET Framework 4.8 will continue to receive security updates.\n\n### **2. Key Features and Improvements**\n\n\n.NET Framework 4.8 includes all the cumulative updates and new features from versions 4.6, 4.7\n, and their point releases. Major enhancements available in 4.8 that are not in 4.5.2\n include:\n\n*   **Security and Cryptography:**\n    *   **Modern Standards:** Support for newer security standards\n, including TLS 1.1 and 1.2 by default (while 4.5.2 requires code\n changes).\n    *   **Improved Cryptography:** Enhanced cryptographic APIs and standards.\n\n*   **Runtime and Performance:**\n\n    *   **64-bit JIT Compiler:** A newer, more performant 64-bit J\nIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.\n    *   **Antimalware Scanning:** Integration with the Antimal\nware Scan Interface (AMSI) to scan assemblies loaded from byte arrays.\n\n*   **WPF and High-DPI:**\n\n    *   **High-DPI Support:** Significant improvements for rendering Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms applications\n on high-DPI displays.\n    *   **Accessibility Improvements:** Enhancements for accessibility in WPF and Windows Forms.\n\n\n*   **C# Language Version:**\n    *   .NET Framework 4.8 supports up to **C# \n7.3**. Newer C# versions are exclusive to the modern .NET platform (formerly .NET Core).\n\n### **3.\n The Shift to Modern .NET**\n\nWhile .NET Framework 4.8 is supported, it's important to note\n that Microsoft's focus for new development is on the cross-platform, open-source **.NET** (which\n will be at version 9 or 10 by 2025). This modern .NET offers significant performance improvements, is\n cross-platform, and is where all new features and language innovations are happening. Many third-party libraries and NuGet packages have\n already dropped support for .NET Framework in favor of the modern .NET.\n\n### **Conclusion and Recommendation for 2\n025**\n\nIn 2025, the primary difference is **security and support**. Running applications on the\n unsupported .NET Framework 4.5.2 poses a significant security risk.\n\n**The clear recommendation is to upgrade\n any applications on .NET Framework 4.5.2 to at least .NET Framework 4.8.** This is typically\n a straightforward, in-place update that ensures you continue to receive security patches. For any new development or major modernization efforts, you\n should strongly consider migrating to the latest version of the modern .NET platform.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the differences between .NET Framework 4.5.2 and the latest version of 4.8 in 2025?","timestamp":27430},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":27430},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769681551699-bc702365e5b1e","status":"completed","timestamp":27430},{"type":"message","content":"By 2025, the differences between .NET Framework 4.5.2","timestamp":27430},{"type":"message","content":" and the latest version, 4.8, are significant, primarily concerning security, features, and long-term viability","timestamp":27430},{"type":"message","content":".

This is a preventative measure within the smart contract to avoid unnecessary and failed transactions.\n\n**Why it happens:**\n\nThe\n error is triggered by a `require` statement in the smart contract code that checks if the destination chain ID is the same as the\n source chain ID. If the chain IDs match, the transaction is reverted with the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error message\n.\n\nYou can see this logic in the `_startBridge` function of the `CBridgeFacet.sol\n` contract:\n\n\n```solidity\nfunction _startBridge(CBridgeData memory _cBridgeData) internal {\n    Storage\n storage s = getStorage();\n    address bridge = _bridge();\n\n    // Do CBridge stuff\n    require(s.\ncBridgeChainId != _cBridgeData.dstChainId, \"Cannot bridge to the same network.\");\n\n    \nif (LibAsset.isNativeAsset(_cBridgeData.token)) {\n        ICBridge(bridge).send\nNative(\n            _cBridgeData.receiver,\n            _cBridgeData.amount,\n            _cBridgeData\n.dstChainId,\n            _cBridgeData.nonce,\n            _cBridgeData.maxSlippage\n\n        );\n    } else {\n        // Give CBridge approval to bridge tokens\n        LibAsset.approveERC2\n0(IERC20(_cBridgeData.token), bridge, _cBridgeData.amount);\n\n        // solhint-\ndisable-next-line check-send-result\n        ICBridge(bridge).send(\n            _cBridgeData.\nreceiver,\n            _cBridgeData.token,\n            _cBridgeData.amount,\n            _c\nBridgeData.dstChainId,\n            _cBridgeData.nonce,\n            _cBridgeData.max\nSlippage\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**How to fix it:**\n\nTo fix this error,\n you need to ensure that the `dstChainId` (destination chain ID) you are providing to the bridge function is different from the\n chain ID of the network you are currently interacting with.\n\nBefore initiating a bridge transaction, you should always check that the source\n and destination chain IDs are not the same.

However, I can provide a summary of what advisory locks are and how they are used in database concurrency control based on\n the search results from other sources.\n\nAdvisory locks are a cooperative locking mechanism used to manage concurrency control in database systems and\n other distributed systems. Unlike mandatory locks, which are enforced by the system, advisory locks rely on the cooperation of the processes\n using them. This means that all processes must agree to use the locking scheme for it to work effectively.

For example, a distributed application might use an advisory lock to ensure\n that only one process can modify a particular file at a time.\n*   **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** In\n HPC applications, advisory locks can be used to manage write contention to shared files.

The practices are stable and likely to remain relevant.\n\n### 1. Use\n `DEFAULT NULL` in your PostgreSQL Function\n\nThe most direct way to handle an optional array is to set its default value to\n `NULL` in your function definition.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a function to get products, where you can optionally\n provide an array of `override_ids` to get specific pricing.\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_products\n_with_optional_overrides(\n  override_ids INT[] DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS TABLE (product_id\n INT, price REAL) AS $$\nBEGIN\n  RETURN QUERY\n  SELECT\n    p.id,\n    CASE\n      \nWHEN override_ids IS NOT NULL AND p.id = ANY(override_ids)\n      THEN 2\n0.0 -- Example override price\n      ELSE p.price\n    END\n  FROM products p;\nEND;\n$$\n LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Handle the `NULL` Case in your Function's Logic\n\nInside\n the function, you must check if the array is `NULL` to determine whether to apply the override logic. The `IS\n NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` checks are essential. In the example above, the `CASE` statement checks \n`WHEN override_ids IS NOT NULL` before attempting to use the `ANY` operator.\n\n### 3. Calling\n the RPC from the Supabase Client\n\nWhen you call the RPC from your application, you can either provide the array or\n omit it.\n\n**With an array of overrides:**\n\n\n```javascript\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n.rpc(\n  'get_products_with_optional_overrides',\n  { override_ids: [1,\n 5, 12] }\n);\n\n```\n\n\n**Without an array of overrides (the parameter is optional\n):**\n\n\n```javascript\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc(\n  'get_products\n_with_optional_overrides'\n);\n\n```\n\n\nIn the second case, the `override_ids` parameter inside\n the PostgreSQL function will be `NULL`, and your logic should handle it gracefully.\n\n### 4. Alternative: Using `JSONB\n` for Complex Cases\n\nIf you have complex requirements or encounter issues with array casting from the client, you can use \n`JSONB` as the parameter type. This is generally more flexible but requires you to parse the JSON within your function. For\n simple optional arrays, `DEFAULT NULL` is sufficient.\n\nBy following these practices, you can create robust and flexible Supabase RPCs\n that handle optional array parameters effectively.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","timestamp":48482},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":48482},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769682282544-007204196aca7","status":"completed","timestamp":48482},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":48482},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769682299453-88bf2ea6208ef8","status":"completed","timestamp":48482},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC","timestamp":48482},{"type":"message","content":" for pricing overrides in 2026.

The `streamText` function, while still a powerful low-level tool, is now often used within\n a more advanced, agent-based architecture introduced in AI SDK 6.\n\nHere's how you can leverage the Vercel\n AI SDK for multimodal content and image support with `streamText`:\n\n### Multimodal Content with `streamText` and\n Agents\n\nThe Vercel AI SDK has evolved to seamlessly integrate multimodal content. You can process and stream text, images, and other\n UI components. The primary way to handle this is through the new agentic workflows, which might use `streamText\n` under the hood.\n\nHere’s a conceptual example of how you might build a multimodal chat application that can process images\n and stream a response. This example uses the higher-level abstractions that are common in 2026.\n\n\n```typescript\n\nimport { vercel, streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai\n';\n\nexport const runtime = 'edge';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages\n } = await req.json();\n\n  // The 'messages' array can now contain multimodal content,\n  // including images\n.\n  const result = await streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'), // Ass\numes a model with vision capabilities\n    messages,\n    // The AI SDK can handle messages with image content and text\n.\n    // The content of a message can be an array of parts, like this:\n    // {\n    //   \nrole: 'user',\n    //   content: [\n    //     { type: 'text', text: 'What\n is in this image?' },\n    //     { type: 'image', image: 'https://example.com/image\n.png' }\n    //   ]\n    // }\n  });\n\n  return result.toAIStream\nResponse();\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Key Features for Image Support in 2026\n\n*   **Multi\n-modal Attachments**: Since version 3.3, the AI SDK has supported multi-modal attachments, allowing you to include\n images and other content in your messages.\n*   **Image Generation**: The SDK provides tools for generating images with language models. This\n is integrated into the streaming and agentic workflows.\n*   **Image Editing**: With AI SDK 6 and later,\n image editing capabilities have been introduced, allowing for more dynamic and interactive applications.\n*   **Composable Agents**: The shift\n to composable agents simplifies building complex, multi-step, and multimodal applications. These agents can reason about and process different\n types of content, including images.\n\n### How it Works Under the Hood\n\nWhile the higher-level APIs are recommended, the core\n `streamText` function is still available for low-level control. When you pass multimodal content to the newer APIs, the\n SDK handles the complexities of encoding the images and other content in a format that the underlying model can understand. The streaming response will\n then contain the text output from the model, which you can render in your application.\n\nIn summary, to use the\n Vercel AI SDK for multimodal content with images in 2026, you should leverage the latest agent-based abstractions\n.

{"id":"websearch-614","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024\nBased on the search results, here's how to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on your blog posts in Google\n Search Console in 2024.\n\nThe most common reason for this issue is that your blog post is not considered a \"\nwatch page\" by Google. A watch page is a page where the primary content is the video. If your video is just\n supplementary to a long-form text article, Google may not index the video from your page.\n\nHere are the key reasons\n and solutions:\n\n### 1. Video Isn't on a Watch Page\n\n*   **Problem:** Google considers\n your page to be a blog post with a video, not a \"video page.\"\n*   **Solution:** For\n your most important videos, create a dedicated page on your site where the video is the main focus. You can have a title\n, the video, and a brief description. You can still embed the same video in your blog posts.\n\n### 2\n. Technical Issues\n\n*   **Video Outside the Viewport:**\n    *   **Problem:** The video is too\n far down the page or hidden.\n    *   **Solution:** Move the video higher up in your content, making\n it more prominent.\n\n*   **No Thumbnail URL Provided:**\n    *   **Problem:** Google couldn't find a\n thumbnail for your video.\n    *   **Solution:** Use `VideoObject` schema markup to explicitly provide a thumbnail URL.\n\n\n*   **Page Not Indexed or Canonical:**\n    *   **Problem:** The page with the video is not indexed or\n is considered a duplicate of another page.\n    *   **Solution:** Use the URL Inspection tool in Google Search Console to ensure the\n page is indexed and is the canonical version.\n\n*   **Video is Deleted or Private:**\n    *   **Problem:** The\n YouTube video you embedded has been removed or set to private.\n    *   **Solution:** Replace the video with a working one\n.\n\n*   **JavaScript Rendering Issues:**\n    *   **Problem:** If your site heavily relies on JavaScript to\n load videos, Googlebot might not see the video during the initial crawl.\n    *   **Solution:** Ensure your video\n is present in the initial HTML of the page.\n\n### 3. How to Implement Fixes\n\n*   **Use Video\nObject Schema:** Adding structured data to your page can significantly help Google understand and index your video. Here is a basic example of\n what you can add to your page's HTML:\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"https\n://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n      \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n\n      \"description\": \"A description of your video.\",\n      \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://www.example\n.com/thumbnail.jpg\",\n      \"uploadDate\": \"2025-01-29\",\n\n      \"duration\": \"PT2M30S\",\n      \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube\n.com/watch?v=your_video_id\",\n      \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube\n.com/embed/your_video_id\",\n      \"interactionStatistic\": {\n        \"@type\": \"\nInteractionCounter\",\n        \"interactionType\": { \"@type\": \"http://schema.org/WatchAction\" },\n        \"\nuserInteractionCount\": 12345\n      }\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n*   **Create\n a Video Sitemap:** A video sitemap can help Google discover your videos more easily.\n\n### Important Consideration\n\nRemember that all\n public YouTube videos are already indexed on YouTube. For many websites, it may not be a critical SEO issue if the embedded\n videos are not also indexed as part of your blog post. Focus on creating great content and ensure your videos are well-integrated\n and provide value to your readers.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","timestamp":40459},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":40459},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769682510359-3f82a6a4a7ee9","status":"completed","timestamp":40459},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":40459},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682526729-3dc1831bf77c7","status":"completed","timestamp":40459},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here's how to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on your blog posts in Google","timestamp":40459},{"type":"message","content":" Search Console in 2024.\n\nThe most common reason for this issue is that your blog post is not considered a \"","timestamp":40459},{"type":"message","content":"watch page\" by Google.

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026\nHandling Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` allows\n you to keep your application's database in sync with your Clerk data. Here is a step-by-step guide on\n how to handle these events:\n\n### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint in Your Application\n\nYou'll need to create\n an API endpoint in your application that will receive the webhook events from Clerk. This endpoint will be responsible for processing the events\n and updating your database accordingly.\n\nHere is an example of how you can create a webhook endpoint in a Next.js application:\n\n\n\n```typescript\n// app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts\nimport { Webhook }\n from 'svix';\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers';\nimport { WebhookEvent } from '@\nclerk/nextjs/server';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  // You can find\n this in the Clerk Dashboard -> Webhooks -> choose the webhook\n  const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.CL\nERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET;\n\n  if (!WEBHOOK_SECRET) {\n    throw new Error('Please\n add CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET from Clerk Dashboard to .env or .env.local');\n  }\n\n  //\n Get the headers\n  const headerPayload = headers();\n  const svix_id = headerPayload.get(\"\nsvix-id\");\n  const svix_timestamp = headerPayload.get(\"svix-timestamp\");\n\n  const svix_signature = headerPayload.get(\"svix-signature\");\n\n  // If there are no headers\n, error out\n  if (!svix_id || !svix_timestamp || !svix_signature) {\n\n    return new Response('Error occured -- no svix headers', {\n      status: 400\n    });\n  \n}\n\n  // Get the body\n  const payload = await req.json();\n  const body = JSON.stringify(payload\n);\n\n  // Create a new Svix instance with your secret.\n  const wh = new Webhook(WEBHOOK_\nSECRET);\n\n  let evt: WebhookEvent;\n\n  // Verify the payload with the headers\n  try {\n\n    evt = wh.verify(body, {\n      \"svix-id\": svix_id,\n\n      \"svix-timestamp\": svix_timestamp,\n      \"svix-signature\": svix_signature\n,\n    }) as WebhookEvent;\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error verifying\n webhook:', err);\n    return new Response('Error occured', {\n      status: 400\n    \n});\n  }\n\n  // Get the ID and type\n  const { id } = evt.data;\n  \nconst eventType = evt.type;\n\n  console.log(`Webhook with and ID of ${id} and type of\n ${eventType}`);\n  console.log('Webhook body:', body);\n\n  // Handle the event\n  switch (eventType\n) {\n    case 'organization.created':\n      // Create the organization in your database\n      // evt.data contains\n the organization data\n      console.log('Organization created:', evt.data);\n      break;\n    case 'organization.\nupdated':\n      // Update the organization in your database\n      // evt.data contains the updated organization data\n      \nconsole.log('Organization updated:', evt.data);\n      break;\n    case 'organization.deleted':\n\n      // Delete the organization from your database\n      // evt.data contains the organization id\n      console.log('Organization deleted\n:', evt.data);\n      break;\n    default:\n      console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${\neventType}`);\n  }\n\n  return new Response('', { status: 201 });\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### \n2. Configure the Webhook in the Clerk Dashboard\n\n1.  Go to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard\n.clerk.com/).\n2.  Navigate to the **Webhooks** page.\n3.  Click\n on the **Add Endpoint** button.\n4.  Enter the URL of the webhook endpoint you created in your application. If\n you are developing locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose\n your local server to the internet.\n5.  Select the events you want to listen to. In this case,\n you would select `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted`.\n6.  Click\n on the **Create** button.\n7.  Copy the webhook secret and add it to your environment variables (e.g.,\n in a `.env.local` file).\n\n### 3. Handling the Events in Your Application\n\nAs shown in the code example\n above, you can use a `switch` statement to handle the different event types.\n\n*   **`organization.created\n`**: When you receive this event, the `evt.data` object will contain the new organization's data. You\n can use this data to create a new organization record in your database.\n\n*   **`organization.updated`**: When an\n organization is updated, you will receive this event with the updated organization data in `evt.data`. You can then update\n the corresponding organization in your database.\n\n*   **`organization.deleted`**: When an organization is deleted, the\n `evt.data` object will contain the ID of the deleted organization. You can use this ID to delete the organization\n from your database or mark it as deleted.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively handle Clerk webhook events for organizations\n and keep your application's data synchronized with Clerk.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","timestamp":25909},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":25909},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682757723-0276210a0ca28","status":"completed","timestamp":25909},{"type":"message","content":"Handling Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` allows","timestamp":25909},{"type":"message","content":" you to keep your application's database in sync with your Clerk data.

{"id":"websearch-738","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026\nUsing KSP for i18n code generation in a\n Kotlin Multiplatform project is a modern and efficient approach. As of 2026, KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)\n is the recommended tool for this, being significantly faster than its predecessor, KAPT.\n\nHere's a guide on how to set\n it up:\n\n### 1. What is KSP?\n\nKSP is an API for creating lightweight compiler plugins.\n It allows you to analyze Kotlin code and generate new files during compilation. For i18n, this means you can have\n a single source of truth for your strings (e.g., in JSON or XML files) and use KSP to generate\n type-safe accessors for them in your shared Kotlin code.\n\n### 2. Setting up KSP in your KMP Project\n\n\nFirst, you need to apply the KSP plugin to your project. In your root `build.gradle.kts`,\n add the plugin:\n\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    alias(libs.plugins.kotlin.multiplatform)\n\n    alias(libs.plugins.ksp) version \"1.9.22-1.0.1\n7\" // Use the version aligned with your Kotlin version\n}\n\n```\n\n\nNext, in your shared module's \n`build.gradle.kts`, you'll need to add the KSP dependency for the targets you want to process. Instead\n of the old `ksp(...)` configuration, you'll use `add(ksp<Target>)` or\n `add(ksp<SourceSet>)`:\n\n\n```kotlin\nkotlin {\n    sourceSets {\n        val\n commonMain by getting {\n            dependencies {\n                // ... your other dependencies\n            }\n        }\n        // ...\n other source sets\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    // For a common processor\n    add(\"kspCommon\nMainMetadata\", \"com.example:my-i18n-processor:1.0.0\")\n\n\n    // For a processor that runs on a specific target\n    add(\"kspAndroid\", \"com.example:my\n-i18n-processor:1.0.0\")\n    add(\"kspIosX6\n4\", \"com.example:my-i18n-processor:1.0.0\")\n    \nadd(\"kspIosArm64\", \"com.example:my-i18n-processor:1.0\n.0\")\n    add(\"kspIosSimulatorArm64\", \"com.example:my-i1\n8n-processor:1.0.0\")\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. i18n Code\n Generation with Moko Resources\n\nA popular and powerful library for i18n in KMP is `moko-resources\n`. It uses a Gradle plugin (which internally uses code generation) to create type-safe resource accessors.\n\n**Step\n 1: Add the Moko Resources plugin**\n\nIn your shared module's `build.gradle.kts`, add the\n plugin:\n\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    // ...\n    id(\"dev.icerock.mobile.multi\nplatform-resources\")\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Step 2: Add the dependency**\n\nIn the `commonMain` source\n set, add the `moko-resources` dependency:\n\n\n```kotlin\nkotlin {\n    sourceSets {\n        \nval commonMain by getting {\n            dependencies {\n                implementation(\"dev.icerock.moko:resources:0\n.23.0\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Step 3: Add\n your string resources**\n\nCreate a `resources` directory in your `commonMain` source set. Inside it, create \n`MR/strings` directories for each language. For example:\n\n*   `shared/src/commonMain/resources/\nMR/strings/en/strings.xml`:\n\n    \n```xml\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding\n=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n    <resources>\n        <string name=\"hello_world\">Hello, World!</string>\n\n    </resources>\n    \n```\n\n*   `shared/src/commonMain/resources/MR/strings/\nes/strings.xml`:\n\n    \n```xml\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\n\" ?>\n    <resources>\n        <string name=\"hello_world\">¡Hola, Mundo!</string>\n    \n</resources>\n    \n```\n\n\n**Step 4: Use the generated resources**\n\nAfter building the project, you\n can access your strings in your common code in a type-safe way:\n\n\n```kotlin\nimport dev.icerock.\nmoko.resources.StringResource\nimport dev.icerock.moko.resources.desc.StringDesc\nimport dev.\nicerock.moko.resources.desc.desc\nimport MR.strings.hello_world\n\nclass Greeting {\n\n    fun greeting(): StringDesc {\n        return MR.strings.hello_world.desc()\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\nOn the platform side (Android/iOS), you can then convert the `StringDesc` to a platform\n-specific string.\n\n### 4. Creating a Custom KSP Processor (Advanced)\n\nIf you need more control\n over the generated code, you can create your own KSP processor.\n\n1.  **Create a new `:k\nsp-processor` module:** This should be a standard Kotlin/Java library module.\n2.  **Add the\n KSP API dependency:** In the `build.gradle.kts` of your new module:\n\n    \n```kotlin\n    dependencies {\n\n        implementation(\"com.google.devtools.ksp:symbol-processing-api:1.9.2\n2-1.0.17\") // Align with your Kotlin version\n    }\n    \n```\n\n3.  \n**Implement `SymbolProcessor`:** This is where you'll define your code generation logic.\n4.  **\nImplement `SymbolProcessorProvider`:** This class will create instances of your `SymbolProcessor`.\n5.  **Register the provider\n:** Create a file in `resources/META-INF/services/com.google.devtools.ksp.processing\n.SymbolProcessorProvider` and put the fully qualified name of your provider class in it.\n6.  **Use\n the processor:** In your shared module, add a dependency on your new processor using the `ksp...` configurations as shown\n in section 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing KSP for i18n in Kotlin Multiplatform is a powerful technique\n. For most use cases, a library like `moko-resources` provides a great solution out of the box.\n If you have more specific needs, creating a custom KSP processor gives you full control over the code generation process. As\n of 2026, KSP is a mature and well-supported tool in the Kotlin ecosystem.\n\nFor\n further reading, you can refer to:\n\n*   [Official KSP Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs\n/ksp-multiplatform.html)\n*   [Moko Resources on GitHub](https://github.com/\nicerockdev/moko-resources)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026","timestamp":46304},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":46304},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769682829972-2bc876ab9b2bd8","status":"completed","timestamp":46304},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":46304},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682844467-bc62fece052a6","status":"completed","timestamp":46304},{"type":"message","content":"Using KSP for i18n code generation in a","timestamp":46304},{"type":"message","content":" Kotlin Multiplatform project is a modern and efficient approach.

{"id":"websearch-787","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to create a checkout session and payment link using the Polar.sh API documentation for 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to create a checkout session and payment link using the Polar.sh API documentation for 2026\nTo create a checkout session and payment link using the Polar.sh API, you'\nll need to use their REST API to make a `POST` request to the `/v1/checkouts/` endpoint. Here\n is a summary of the process, with code examples.\n\n### 1. Authentication\nFirst, you need to authenticate with\n the Polar API using an **Organization Access Token (OAT)**. You can create an OAT in your organization'\ns settings. Remember to keep your OAT secure and never expose it in client-side code.\n\n### 2\n. Creating the Checkout Session\nYou can create a checkout session by sending a `POST` request to the `/v1/check\nouts` endpoint with the required parameters. The most important parameter is the `product_id`.\n\nHere is an example of how\n to create a checkout session using `cURL`:\n\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.polar.sh/\nv1/checkouts/\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $POLAR_OAT\" \\\n\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     --data-raw '{\n        \"product\n_id\": \"your_product_id\",\n        \"success_url\": \"https://your-website.com\n/success\"\n     }'\n\n```\n\n\nReplace `$POLAR_OAT` with your Organization Access Token and `\"\nyour_product_id\"` with the ID of the product you want to sell.\n\n### 3. The Response (\nPayment Link)\n\nThe API will respond with a JSON object containing the checkout session details. This object will include a `url\n` property, which is the payment link you should redirect your customer to.\n\nHere is an example of the API response:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"cs_12345\",\n  \"url\": \"https\n://checkout.polar.sh/s/cs_12345/payment\",\n  \"status\": \"open\n\",\n  \"product\": {\n    \"id\": \"prod_12345\",\n    \"name\":\n \"My Awesome Product\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThe `url` in the response is the payment link\n that you can provide to your customers.\n\n### Using the Polar SDK\nFor a more streamlined integration, you can use\n the official Polar SDK. Here is an example of how to create a checkout session using the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport { Polar } from \"@polar-sh/sdk\";\n\nconst polar = new Polar({\n  accessToken\n: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN\n});\n\nasync function createCheckout() {\n  const checkout\n = await polar.checkouts.create({\n    body: {\n      product_id: \"your_product\n_id\",\n      success_url: \"https://your-website.com/success\"\n    }\n\n  });\n  console.log(checkout.url); // The payment link\n  return checkout;\n}\n\n\ncreateCheckout();\n\n\n```\n\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official Polar.sh API documentation:\n\n*   **\nCreate Checkout Session API Reference**: [https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/checkouts/create-\nsession](https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/checkouts/create-session)\n*   \n**Checkout API Feature Guide**: [https://polar.sh/docs/features/checkout/session](https://polar\n.sh/docs/features/checkout/session)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to create a checkout session and payment link using the Polar.sh API documentation for 2026","timestamp":20812},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":20812},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683028461-ca2d3e748ccfa8","status":"completed","timestamp":20812},{"type":"message","content":"To create a checkout session and payment link using the Polar.sh API, you'","timestamp":20812},{"type":"message","content":"ll need to use their REST API to make a `POST` request to the `/v1/checkouts/` endpoint.

{"id":"websearch-842","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?\nBy 2026, the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI will be\n a combination of established best practices and emerging, more sophisticated methods. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know:\n\n\n### Core Concepts and Current Best Practices on Vertex AI\n\nThese are the foundational techniques that are currently best practice and will continue\n to be essential in 2026:\n\n*   **Clear and Concise Language:** Your text prompts should be as unambiguous\n as possible. For example, instead of \"show me the anomaly,\" a better prompt would be \"draw a bounding box around the\n malignant tumor in the lower-left quadrant of the lung.\"\n*   **Leverage Vertex AI's Gemini \n2.0:** Google's Gemini 2.0 model has powerful spatial understanding capabilities. Utilize the provided notebooks and documentation\n to understand how to format your prompts and work with the bounding box output. The coordinates are normalized to `[y_min,\n x_min, y_max, x_max]` on a 0-1000 scale, so your\n code will need to handle this.\n*   **Few-Shot Prompting:** Provide a few examples of what you'\nre looking for in your prompt. For instance, you could include a couple of images with correctly drawn bounding boxes and their\n corresponding labels. This gives the model a clearer understanding of your expectations.\n*   **Weakly Supervised Learning:** Use\n bounding boxes as a form of \"weak supervision\" to train your models. This is far more efficient than pixel-level segmentation and\n is a well-established technique that will continue to be relevant. Vertex AI has a clear schema for importing this type of data for\n training custom models.\n\n### Emerging Techniques for 2026 and Beyond\n\nThe field is rapidly evolving. Here are the techniques\n that are gaining traction and will be critical in 2026:\n\n*   **Multimodal Prompts:** Don\n't just rely on text. In 2026, it will be standard practice to use a combination of text,\n images, and even other data modalities (like patient history or genomic data) to guide your model. For example, you might\n provide an MRI image, the text \"draw a bounding box around the glioblastoma,\" and a link to a pathology\n report.\n*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** This is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of complex\n tasks. Instead of asking the model to do everything at once, you break the task down into a series of logical steps. For example\n:\n    1.  \"First, identify the lungs in this CT scan.\"\n    2.  \"Next\n, locate any nodules within the lung tissue.\"\n    3.  \"Finally, draw a bounding box around any nodules that have\n a spiculated appearance and are larger than 10mm.\"\n*   **Automated Prompt Generation:** Expect to\n see more tools and techniques for automatically generating and optimizing prompts. This could involve using one AI model to generate prompts for another,\n or using reinforcement learning to discover the most effective prompt structures.\n*   **Adversarial Prompting for Robustness:** To\n ensure your models are robust and reliable, you will need to test them against \"adversarial\" prompts that are designed to trick\n them. This could involve using confusing language, ambiguous images, or subtle visual artifacts.\n*   **3D and\n Volumetric Prompting:** For medical imaging data like MRI and CT scans, the ability to work with 3D bounding boxes will be\n crucial.

Here\n's a summary of the key principles:\n\n### Core Principle: Edge-to-Edge by Default\n\nStarting with\n Android 15 (API level 35), apps that target SDK 35 or higher will have an edge-to\n-edge display enforced. This means your app's content will be drawn behind the system status and navigation bars, creating\n a more immersive experience.\n\n### Handling UI Overlaps with Window Insets\n\nTo prevent your app's content and\n interactive elements from being obscured by the system bars, you must use `WindowInsets`. These APIs provide the dimensions and location of the\n system UI elements.\n\nThere are several types of insets to be aware of:\n\n*   **System Bar Insets (\n`systemBars()`):** The most common inset, representing the area where the status bar and navigation bar are displayed. Use\n this to pad tappable elements to ensure they are not hidden.\n*   **System Gesture Insets (`systemGestureInsets\n()`):** These insets define the areas where system gestures (like the back gesture) take priority over app gestures.\n*\n   **Safe Drawing Insets (`safeDrawing()`):** Use these insets to protect content that should not be drawn\n underneath any system UI.\n*   **Safe Gesture Insets (`safeGestures()`):** These insets protect your\n app's gestures from conflicting with system gestures.\n*   **Safe Content Insets (`safeContent()`):** This is\n a combination of `safeDrawing()` and `safeGestures()` to ensure content has no visual or gesture overlap with the\n system UI.\n\n### Navigation Bar Gesture Insets\n\nThe handling of navigation bar insets differs depending on the user's selected\n navigation mode:\n\n*   **Gesture Navigation:** The navigation bar is transparent. You should allow your app's content\n to draw behind it for a seamless look. It's crucial to use the `systemGestureInsets` to avoid placing\n interactive elements in the gesture area.\n*   **Three-Button Navigation:** The navigation bar is translucent. You should still draw\n your app content behind it, but be mindful of the translucent scrim.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n*   **Jetpack Compose:**\n\n    *   Use the `WindowInsets` provided by the Compose Foundation library to apply padding and modifiers to your compos\nables.\n    *   The Material 3 `Scaffold` component is designed to handle insets for common layouts\n, making it easier to build an edge-to-edge experience.\n*   **Android Views:**\n    *   Use \n`ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` to listen for inset changes and apply padding or margins to your views accordingly.\n\n###\n Key Takeaways for 2026:\n\n*   **Embrace Edge-to-Edge:** It's the default\n and expected user experience.\n*   **Master WindowInsets:** This is the fundamental tool for managing the relationship between your app\n's UI and the system UI.\n*   **Prioritize Gesture Navigation:** Design for a transparent navigation bar and\n be mindful of gesture areas.\n*   **Use Modern Tools:** Leverage Jetpack Compose and Material 3 components to simplify inset\n handling.\n*   **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure your app's UI is not obscured and that all interactive elements are easily\n accessible in both gesture and three-button navigation modes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","timestamp":22997},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":22997},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683192269-a13512613cf7b8","status":"completed","timestamp":22997},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683192287-68f71c37307e8","status":"completed","timestamp":22997},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest Android documentation and guidelines for 2026, the","timestamp":22997},{"type":"message","content":" primary focus for handset inset handling and navigation bar gestures is to create seamless, edge-to-edge experiences for users.

Here are the key trends:\n\n### 1. Rise\n of Multi-Agent Systems and Specialization\nThe dominant trend is the shift towards **multi-agent AI systems**. Instead of\n relying on a single, generalist AI, organizations are deploying teams of specialized AI agents. Each agent is designed for a specific task or\n role, and they collaborate to achieve complex business objectives. This is often referred to as **\"agentic AI.\"**\n\n### \n2. AI Orchestration and \"Uber-Models\"\nTo manage these teams of agents, **AI orchestration frameworks** are becoming essential\n. These frameworks act as a \"puppeteer\" or \"uber-model\" that coordinates the workflow between different agents.\n They handle task assignments, communication, and error handling, ensuring the agents work together harmoniously. Popular frameworks in this space\n include **LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen**.\n\n### 3. Emergence of Hierarchical Management Structures\nA\n clear hierarchy is forming in the management of AI agents. This includes:\n*   **AI Workforce Managers:** A new role,\n either human or an AI model itself, is emerging to orchestrate the work between human employees and AI agents.\n*   **Fl\natter Organizational Structures:** As AI agents take on more coordination tasks, traditional middle management roles are expected to decrease, leading to flatter\n organizational hierarchies.\n\n### 4. Standardization of Agent Communication\nTo enable seamless collaboration between agents from different developers and platforms\n, new communication protocols are being established. **Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Google’s\n Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)** are examples of emerging standards that will function like an \"HTTP for\n agents,\" allowing for greater interoperability.\n\n### 5. Emphasis on Governance and Safe Operation\nWith the increasing autonomy of\n AI agents, there is a heightened focus on **governance, safety, and ethical considerations**. Companies are implementing frameworks to ensure\n that agents operate within defined policies and comply with regulations like the **EU AI Act**. This includes robust logging, auditing, and human\n-in-the-loop oversight.\n\n### 6. Proliferation of Low-Code/No-Code Platforms\n\nThe development and deployment of AI agents are becoming more accessible through **low-code and no-code platforms**. This is\n accelerating the adoption of AI agents across various industries, allowing non-experts to build and manage their own agentic systems.\n\n### \n7. Shift from Prototypes to Production-Ready Systems\nIn 2025, AI agents are moving beyond\n the experimental phase and are being integrated into core business processes. We are seeing production-ready systems in fields such as:\n*\n   **Finance:** For risk analysis and workflow automation.\n*   **Logistics:** For supply chain optimization and forecasting\n.\n*   **Customer Support:** To reduce call times and improve service quality.\n\n### 8. Redefined\n Workforce Dynamics\nAI agents are increasingly seen as **autonomous digital collaborators** rather than just tools. This is leading to a\n significant shift in workforce dynamics, requiring new approaches to employee training, upskilling, and professional development to prepare for a hybrid\n human-AI work environment.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest trends in AI agent coordination and hierarchical team management for 2025?","timestamp":21564},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":21564},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683345550-979d6b9aee732","status":"completed","timestamp":21564},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research","timestamp":21564},{"type":"message","content":", the latest trends in AI agent coordination and hierarchical team management for 2025 are centered around the move from","timestamp":21564},{"type":"message","content":" single, monolithic AI models to sophisticated multi-agent systems.

{"id":"websearch-915","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025?\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to set up Apache Guacamole in\n Docker with a PostgreSQL database. This guide is based on current best practices and should be valid for 2025\n.\n\nThis setup uses `docker-compose` to orchestrate the necessary containers: `guacd`, `postgres`, and `gu\nacamole`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   Docker and `docker-compose` installed on your system.\n\n### Step 1: Create\n a Project Directory\n\nFirst, create a directory to hold your `docker-compose.yml` file and the database initialization script.\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir guacamole-docker\ncd guacamole-docker\nmkdir init\n```\n\n\n### Step 2: Generate\n the Database Initialization Script\n\nThe PostgreSQL database needs to be initialized with the Guacamole schema. You can generate the necessary SQL\n script by running a temporary Guacamole container.\n\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm guacamole/guacamole /opt/gu\nacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgres > ./init/initdb.sql\n\n```\n\n\nThis command will\n create an `initdb.sql` file inside the `init` directory. This script will be used to set up the database schema\n automatically.\n\n### Step 3: Create the `docker-compose.yml` File\n\nCreate a file named `docker-\ncompose.yml` in your `guacamole-docker` directory and add the following content:\n\n\n```yaml\nversion: '\n3'\n\nservices:\n  guacd:\n    image: guacamole/guacd\n    container_name: gu\nacd\n    restart: always\n    volumes:\n      - ./drive:/drive:rw\n      - ./record\n:/record:rw\n    networks:\n      - guac-network\n\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres:\n15\n    container_name: postgres\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      PGDATA: /var\n/lib/postgresql/data/guacamole\n      POSTGRES_DB: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES_USER\n: guacamole_user\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: \"YourStrongPasswordHere\"\n    volumes:\n      -\n ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n      - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d\n\n    networks:\n      - guac-network\n\n  guacamole:\n    image: guacamole/guacamole\n\n    container_name: guacamole\n    restart: always\n    depends_on:\n      - guacd\n      - postgres\n\n    environment:\n      GUACD_HOSTNAME: guacd\n      POSTGRES_HOSTNAME: postgres\n\n      POSTGRES_DATABASE: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES_USER: guacamole_user\n      POST\nGRES_PASSWORD: \"YourStrongPasswordHere\"\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:80\n80\"\n    networks:\n      - guac-network\n\nnetworks:\n  guac-network:\n\n    driver: bridge\n\n```\n\n\n**Important:** Before you start the containers, you **must** change the `POSTG\nRES_PASSWORD` value in the `docker-compose.yml` file to a strong, unique password. Use the same password for\n both the `postgres` and `guacamole` services.\n\n### Step 4: Start the Containers\n\nNow,\n from your `guacamole-docker` directory, start all the services in detached mode:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up\n -d\n\n```\n\n\nDocker will now pull the necessary images and start the containers.\n\n### Step 5: Access Gu\nacamole\n\nOnce the containers are running, you can access the Guacamole web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to:\n\n\n`http://<your-server-ip>:8080`\n\nIf you are running this on your local machine\n, you can use `http://localhost:8080`.\n\nThe default login credentials are:\n\n*   \n**Username:** `guacadmin`\n*   **Password:** `guacadmin`\n\n**It is critical\n that you change the default `guacadmin` password immediately after your first login.**\n\n### Explanation of the `docker-compose.\nyml` file:\n\n*   **`guacd` service:** This is the Guacamole proxy daemon. It'\ns the core component that communicates with the remote desktops.\n*   **`postgres` service:** This is the PostgreSQL database.\n\n    *   The `environment` variables configure the database name, user, and password.\n    *   The `volumes\n` section does two things:\n        *   `./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`: This mounts a\n local `./data` directory into the container to persist the database data.\n        *   `./init:/docker-entrypoint-\ninitdb.d`: This mounts the `initdb.sql` script you created earlier. The official PostgreSQL image will\n automatically execute any `.sql` scripts found in this directory when the container is first created.\n*   **`guacamole` service\n:** This is the Guacamole web application.\n    *   `depends_on`: This ensures that the `guacd\n` and `postgres` containers are started before the `guacamole` container.\n    *   `environment`: These variables tell\n the Guacamole container how to connect to the `guacd` and `postgres` containers.\n    *   `ports`:\n This exposes the Guacamole web interface on port `8080`.\n*   **`networks`:** This creates a\n dedicated bridge network for the Guacamole containers, allowing them to communicate with each other by their service names.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up Guacamole in Docker with a PostgreSQL database in 2025?","timestamp":27474},{"type":"tool_call","name":"write_todos","status":"pending","timestamp":27474},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":27475},{"type":"tool_call","name":"write_todos-1769683380724-d9a1ff40fe5118","status":"completed","timestamp":27475},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683380742-e5c48a5cb25fc","status":"completed","timestamp":27475},{"type":"message","content":"Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up Apache Guacamole in","timestamp":27475},{"type":"message","content":" Docker with a PostgreSQL database.

You can interrupt a graph's\n execution, wait for human input, and then resume it. This is managed through a checkpointer, the `interrupt\n` function, and the `Command` object for resuming.\n\nWhen a graph is interrupted, its state is saved by the\n checkpointer.

When this is called, the graph's execution stops and returns control to your script. The\n argument to `interrupt()` is a message that explains why the interruption occurred.\n3.  **Checkpointer (`InMemorySaver`)**:\n A checkpointer is essential. It automatically saves the graph's state when `interrupt()` is called. When you resume, the\n graph loads this saved state and continues from the exact point it left off.\n4.  **Initial `invoke`**: The\n first `graph.invoke()` runs the graph until the `interrupt()` in `human_approval_node` is hit. The output\n is a dictionary with a special `__interrupt__` key.\n5.  **Human Input**: Your script detects\n the interrupt, gets input from the user, and prepares to resume the workflow.\n6.  **Resuming with `Command\n`**: You `invoke` the graph a second time. This time, you pass the human's decision into the state\n. Although we are just updating the state here, for more complex resume operations, you would wrap your input in the `Command` object\n. The checkpointer, identified by the `thread_id` in the config, ensures the graph doesn't start\n from the beginning but continues to the next node (`tool_executor`).\n7.  **Conditional Execution (`tool_executor`)\n**: This final node checks the `human_decision` in the state to decide whether to proceed with the action or stop\n.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","timestamp":34506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":34506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683422460-6ded5db1373bc8","status":"completed","timestamp":34506},{"type":"message","content":"In 2026, LangGraph provides","timestamp":34506},{"type":"message","content":" robust mechanisms for incorporating human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows.

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026\nPyTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing due to how processes are created and resources\n are shared. Here are several ways to fix or avoid this issue, with the most common and effective solutions listed first.\n\n\n### 1. Use the `spawn` or `forkserver` Start Method\n\nThe default `fork` start method\n for multiprocessing can be problematic because it copies the parent process's state, including locks and threads, which can lead to deadlocks in\n child processes. Using `spawn` or `forkserver` is generally safer as they start fresh processes.\n\nYou can\n set the start method at the beginning of your main script:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn') # Or 'forkserver\n'\n\n    # Your multiprocessing code here\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Initialize CUDA in Worker Processes\n\nIf you are\n using GPUs, initialize CUDA within each worker process, not in the main process before starting the child processes. This prevents the CUDA\n state from being copied to the child processes, which can cause deadlocks.\n\n**Incorrect:**\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n\n# Don't initialize CUDA here\n# torch.cuda.set_device(0)\n\ndef worker(rank\n, world_size):\n    # ...\n    pass\n\n```\n\n\n**Correct:**\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n\ndef worker(rank, world_size):\n    # Initialize CUDA within the worker\n    torch.cuda.set_device\n(rank)\n    # ...\n    pass\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Load the Model After Starting Processes\n\nLoad\n the model and its state dictionary *inside* the worker processes, not in the main process. This is especially important when\n using the `fork` start method.\n\n**Incorrect:**\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n\nmodel = MyModel()\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))\n\ndef worker(\nmodel):\n    # ...\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.spawn(worker, args\n=(model,), nprocs=4)\n\n```\n\n\n**Correct:**\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch\n.multiprocessing as mp\n\ndef worker(rank, world_size):\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.\nload_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))\n    # ...\n\nif __name__ ==\n \"__main__\":\n    mp.spawn(worker, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size)\n\n```\n\n\nIf you need to pass the model between processes, it's better to pass the `state_dict` instead\n of the model object itself, for example, using a `multiprocessing.Queue`.\n\n### 4. Use `Distributed\nDataParallel` for Multi-GPU Training\n\nFor multi-GPU training, `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel\n` is the recommended approach. It is designed for this purpose and handles the complexities of multiprocessing and data distribution for you.\n\nYou\n can find a complete guide to `DistributedDataParallel` in the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials\n/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).\n\n### 5. Set `TOKENIZERS_PARALLEL\nISM` for Hugging Face Transformers\n\nIf you are using the Hugging Face `transformers` library, you might encounter dead\nlocks due to the library's internal parallelism. You can disable this by setting an environment variable:\n\n\n```python\nimport\n os\n\nos.environ[\"TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM\"] = \"false\"\n\n```\n\n\nSet this at\n the beginning of your script, before you import the `transformers` library.\n\n### 6. Set `OMP_\nNUM_THREADS=1`\n\nSome libraries that PyTorch depends on, like MKL or OpenMP, use their own thread pools\n. This can conflict with multiprocessing. Setting the number of threads to 1 can sometimes resolve these conflicts:\n\n\n```python\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OMP_NUM_THREADS\"] = \"1\"\n\n```\n\n\n### 7. Change\n the Multiprocessing Sharing Strategy\n\nOn systems with low limits on the number of open file descriptors, the default sharing strategy might\n cause issues. You can change it to `file_system`:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n\nmp.set_sharing_strategy('file_system')\n\n```\n\n\nThis should be done at the beginning of your main script\n. Note that this can be slower than the default `file_descriptor` strategy.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","timestamp":34859},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":34859},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769683537369-fb031396940a18","status":"completed","timestamp":34859},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":34860},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683548695-f4393fa68376c","status":"completed","timestamp":34860},{"type":"message","content":"PyTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing due to how processes are created and resources","timestamp":34860},{"type":"message","content":" are shared.

{"id":"websearch-990","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?\nBased on the latest research in 2024 and early 2025, the\n field of data selection for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning has moved beyond traditional RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) towards more\n automated and sophisticated techniques. Here are some of the latest trends:\n\n### 1. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RL\nVR)\n\nThis is the most significant trend. Instead of relying on human feedback, which can be slow and expensive to\n collect, RLVR uses rewards based on verifiable outcomes. This is particularly effective for reasoning tasks where the final answer can be program\nmatically checked for correctness.\n\n*   **Example:** For mathematical reasoning problems, the model's final answer can be compared\n against the correct solution to generate a reward signal.\n*   **Key Model:** **DeepSeek-R1** is a\n prominent example of a model trained using RLVR, showing significant improvements in reasoning capabilities.\n\n### 2. Process Reward\n Models (PRMs) vs. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs)\n\nThere is ongoing research into not just rewarding the final outcome\n (ORM), but also the intermediate steps in the reasoning process (PRM).\n\n*   **Outcome Reward Models (OR\nMs):** These are simpler and more common.

By 2026, the `background-clip: text` property is well-supported in all\n modern browsers, often still with the `-webkit-` prefix for maximum compatibility.\n\nHere’s how to create a\n stunning hover effect with a radial gradient clipped to text.\n\n### The Technique\n\nThis effect works by setting a `background-image\n` (our radial gradient) on a text element, and then using `background-clip: text` to confine that\n background to the shape of the characters. The text's own color is set to `transparent` so the background can show through.\n The hover effect is achieved by smoothly transitioning the gradient's size and position.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere is a complete HTML file\n demonstrating the effect. You can save it as `index.html` and open it in your browser.\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE\n html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta\n name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title\n>CSS Background-Clip Text Hover Effect 2026</title>\n    <style>\n        @\nimport url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@900&display\n=swap');\n\n        body {\n            display: grid;\n            place-items: center;\n            height\n: 100vh;\n            margin: 0;\n            background-color: #1a1a1a\n;\n            font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\n        }\n\n        h1 {\n            \nfont-size: 6rem;\n            font-weight: 900;\n            text-align: center;\n\n            text-transform: uppercase;\n\n            /* 1.

This gradient goes from a solid white circle\n (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)`) to fully transparent (`rgba(\n255, 255, 255, 0)`), creating a soft \"light\" effect.\n\n2.  **Initial State**: The `background-size` is set to `0% 0%`, making\n the gradient initially invisible. It's positioned in the center with `background-position: 50% 50\n%`.\n3.  **Clipping**: `background-clip: text` (with the `-webkit-\n` prefix) is the magic ingredient. It masks the background with the text content of the `<h1>`.\n4.  \n**Transparency**: `color: transparent` makes the original text color invisible, allowing the clipped background to show through.\n5.\n  **Hover Effect**: When you hover over the `<h1>`, the `background-size` expands to `30\n0% 300%`.\n6.  **Smooth Transition**: The `transition` property on `background-size\n` ensures that this expansion is animated smoothly, creating the elegant \"radial overlay\" effect.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use CSS background-clip text with a radial gradient overlay hover effect in 2026?","timestamp":27771},{"type":"message","content":"Of","timestamp":27771},{"type":"message","content":" course.

Here are the primary causes and how to resolve them:\n\n### Common Causes of Go Version Compatibility Errors\n\n\n1.  **Mismatched Go Version in `PATH`**: `govulncheck` relies on the `go\n` command found in your system's `PATH`. If you have multiple Go versions installed, `govulncheck\n` might be using a different version than the one your project requires, leading to inaccurate results or errors.\n\n2.  **Out\ndated Go Version**: Running an older version of Go can cause `govulncheck` to flag vulnerabilities in the standard library that\n have already been fixed in newer releases. `govulncheck` itself requires Go 1.18 or newer to\n run, and binaries must be compiled with Go 1.18 or newer for full vulnerability analysis of third-party modules\n.\n\n3.  **Vulnerable Dependencies**: The most common scenario is that `govulncheck` identifies vulnerabilities\n within your project's dependencies. These are not direct errors with `govulncheck` itself but rather issues flagged\n by the tool.\n\n4.  **CGO Usage**: Projects that use CGO can sometimes interfere with `govul\nncheck`'s analysis, causing it to fail.\n\n5.  **High Memory Usage**: On very large projects,\n `govulncheck` may consume a large amount of memory to build the call graph, which can lead to the process being\n terminated by the operating system.\n\n### How to Resolve Them\n\n1.  **Manage Your Go Version**:\n    *   \n**Use a Version Manager**: Tools like `gvm` or `goenv` allow you to easily switch between different Go versions,\n ensuring you are using the correct one for your project.\n    *   **Explicitly Set `PATH`**: You\n can temporarily set the `PATH` environment variable to point to the correct Go installation when running `govulncheck`.\n\n\n2.  **Upgrade Your Go Version**:\n    *   **Stay Up-to-Date**: Regularly update to the latest\n stable version of Go to get the latest security patches and features.\n    *   **Recompile Binaries**: If\n you are scanning compiled binaries, make sure they are built with a recent version of Go (1.18+).\n\n3.\n  **Manage Vulnerable Dependencies**:\n    *   **Upgrade Modules**: When `govulncheck` reports a vulnerability in\n a dependency, the best course of action is to upgrade to a newer, patched version of that module.\n    *   **\nRefactor Code**: If an upgrade is not possible, you may be able to refactor your code to avoid using the vulnerable\n functions.\n\n4.  **Handle CGO Issues**:\n    *   **Disable CGO**: If you encounter C\nGO-related errors, you can try disabling it by setting the environment variable `CGO_ENABLED=0` before running \n`govulncheck`.\n\n5.  **Address High Memory Usage**:\n    *   **Increase Memory**: If \n`govulncheck` is crashing due to memory issues, try running it on a machine with more RAM.\n    *   \n**Scan in Parts**: For very large codebases, you can run `govulncheck` on smaller packages or modules\n individually.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","timestamp":38796},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":38796},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769683832758-37d286a2d166a8","status":"completed","timestamp":38796},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":38796},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769683845490-0934f9737a0bb","status":"completed","timestamp":38796},{"type":"message","content":"As of 2026, Go version compatibility errors in `govulncheck` are typically caused by a","timestamp":38796},{"type":"message","content":" handful of common issues.

{"id":"websearch-1049","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation\nBased on the latest 2025 documentation and developer guides, setting up web push notifications\n for Safari on iOS 16.4+ requires treating your website as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that the\n user adds to their Home Screen. This process uses standard web APIs (Push API, Notifications API, Service Workers) and does not\n require a paid Apple Developer account.\n\nHere is a comprehensive step-by-step guide:\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n\n*   **iOS 16.4 or Newer:** The feature is only available on devices running iOS or iPadOS 1\n6.4 and later.\n*   **Add to Home Screen (A2HS):** Push notifications will *only* work\n after the user has added your web app to their Home Screen from Safari and launches it from there. Direct push notifications within\n the browser are not supported on iOS.\n*   **HTTPS:** Your website must be served over a secure HTTPS connection.\n\n*   **User Interaction:** You can only request notification permission after a direct user action, like tapping a button.\n\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Web App Manifest\n\nThe `manifest.json` file tells iOS that your\n site can be installed as a standalone web app.\n\n1.  **Create the `manifest.json` file**\n in the root directory of your project.\n2.  **Add the necessary properties.** The `display` property must be set to\n `standalone` or `fullscreen`.\n\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"name\": \"My Awesome Web App\",\n      \n\"short_name\": \"AwesomeApp\",\n      \"start_url\": \"/\",\n      \"display\": \"standalone\",\n\n      \"background_color\": \"#FFFFFF\",\n      \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n\n      \"icons\": [\n        {\n          \"src\": \"/icons/icon-192x1\n92.png\",\n          \"type\": \"image/png\",\n          \"sizes\": \"192x\n192\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"src\": \"/icons/icon-512x\n512.png\",\n          \"type\": \"image/png\",\n          \"sizes\": \"51\n2x512\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Link\n to the manifest** in the `<head>` of your main HTML file:\n\n    \n```html\n    <link rel\n=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n    <!-- Recommended: Add Apple-specific touch icon for high-quality home\n screen icon -->\n    <link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/icons/apple-touch-icon\n.png\">\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 2: Create and Register a Service Worker\n\nThe service worker is a\n JavaScript file that runs in the background to listen for and display incoming push notifications.\n\n1.  **Create the `service-worker\n.js` file** in your root directory. This file will handle the `push` event.\n\n    \n```javascript\n\n    // service-worker.js\n\n    self.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n      const data\n = event.data ? event.data.json() : {};\n      const title = data.title || 'Default\n Title';\n      const options = {\n        body: data.body || 'Default body message.',\n        icon\n: '/icons/icon-192x192.png', // Optional\n      };\n\n      event.waitUntil\n(\n        self.registration.showNotification(title, options)\n      );\n    });\n    \n```\n\n\n2\n.  **Register the service worker** in your main client-side JavaScript file.\n\n    \n```javascript\n    //\n main.js\n\n    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n      navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service\n-worker.js')\n        .then(registration => {\n          console.log('Service Worker registered successfully:', registration\n);\n        })\n        .catch(error => {\n          console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n\n        });\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Subscription Process (Client-Side)\n\n\nThis involves guiding the user and then using the Push API to subscribe them.\n\n1.  **Prompt the User to\n Add to Home Screen:** Since push is only available after A2HS, your first step is to inform the user. You\n should only show this message to users on iOS.\n\n    \n```javascript\n    function isIOS() {\n      return\n /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent) && !window.MSStream;\n    }\n\n\n    // Check if the app is running in standalone mode (from Home Screen)\n    function isInStandaloneMode() {\n      \nreturn ('standalone' in window.navigator) && (window.navigator.standalone);\n    }\n\n    if (is\nIOS() && !isInStandaloneMode()) {\n      // Show a banner, modal, or message guiding the user to\n\n      // tap the 'Share' button and then 'Add to Home Screen'.\n      console.log('Please add this\n app to your home screen to enable notifications.');\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Create a Subscription Button:** Add\n a button to your HTML that the user can click to initiate the subscription process. This should only be visible/enabled after\n the app is launched from the home screen.\n\n    \n```html\n    <button id=\"subscribeButton\" style=\"display\n:none;\">Subscribe to Notifications</button>\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Handle the Subscription Logic:** When the button\n is clicked, request permission and get the push subscription.\n\n    \n```javascript\n    // main.js\n\n    // V\nAPID keys are used to identify your application server to the push service.\n    // Generate these once for your application\n.\n    const VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY'; // Replace\n with your key\n\n    function urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n      const padding\n = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n      const base\n64 = (base64String + padding).replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/\n');\n      const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n      const outputArray = new Uint\n8Array(rawData.length);\n      for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length;\n ++i) {\n        outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n      }\n      \nreturn outputArray;\n    }\n\n    async function subscribeUser() {\n      try {\n        const permission = await\n Notification.requestPermission();\n        if (permission === 'granted') {\n          console.log('Notification permission granted.');\n\n          const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n          const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n            \nuserVisibleOnly: true,\n            applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(VAPID_\nPUBLIC_KEY)\n          });\n\n          console.log('User is subscribed:', subscription);\n\n          // IMPORTANT: Send the subscription\n object to your server\n          await fetch('/api/save-subscription', {\n            method: 'POST',\n            body\n: JSON.stringify(subscription),\n            headers: {\n              'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n\n            }\n          });\n        } else {\n          console.warn('Notification permission denied.');\n        }\n      \n} catch (error) {\n        console.error('Failed to subscribe the user:', error);\n      }\n\n    }\n\n    // Only show the button if running as a Home Screen app on iOS\n    if (isIOS()\n && isInStandaloneMode()) {\n      const subscribeBtn = document.getElementById('subscribeButton');\n      subscribeBtn.style.display\n = 'block';\n      subscribeBtn.addEventListener('click', subscribeUser);\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n###\n Step 4: Send Notifications (Server-Side)\n\nYour server will use the saved subscription object to send messages.\n This example uses the popular `web-push` library for Node.js.\n\n1.  **Install the library:**\n\n\n    \n```bash\n    npm install web-push\n    ```\n\n\n2.  **Configure and send the notification:**\n\n    \n```javascript\n    // server.js\n\n    const webpush = require('web-push');\n\n    // Generate\n VAPID keys once and store them securely\n    const vapidKeys = {\n      publicKey: 'YOUR_VAPID\n_PUBLIC_KEY',   // Replace with your key\n      privateKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY'\n // Replace with your key\n    };\n\n    webpush.setVapidDetails(\n      'mailto:your\n-email@example.com',\n      vapidKeys.publicKey,\n      vapidKeys.privateKey\n\n    );\n\n    // Endpoint to trigger a push notification\n    // In a real app, you'd retrieve the\n subscription from your database\n    app.post('/send-notification', (req, res) => {\n      // This\n is the subscription object you saved from the client\n      const userSubscription = req.body.subscription;\n\n      const\n payload = JSON.stringify({\n        title: 'Hello from Server!',\n        body: 'This is your push notification.'\n\n      });\n\n      webpush.sendNotification(userSubscription, payload)\n        .then(() => res.status(20\n0).json({ message: 'Notification sent successfully.' }))\n        .catch(error => {\n          console.\nerror('Error sending notification:', error);\n          res.sendStatus(500);\n        });\n    });\n\n    \n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":37647},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":37647},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683956782-b448eac5c8d4c8","status":"completed","timestamp":37647},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest 2025 documentation and developer guides, setting up web push notifications","timestamp":37647},{"type":"message","content":" for Safari on iOS 16.4+ requires treating your website as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that the","timestamp":37647},{"type":"message","content":" user adds to their Home Screen.

{"id":"websearch-1075","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?\nOf course! Here’s a guide to using GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who\n aren't programmers.\n\n### What is GitHub and GitHub Desktop?\n\nThink of **GitHub** as a cloud-\nbased service for storing and sharing files and projects, similar to Google Drive or Dropbox. It's especially good at tracking changes in\n those files over time. This is called \"version control.\"\n\n**GitHub Desktop** is a user-friendly application for\n your computer that lets you interact with GitHub without having to use the command line or a web browser. It makes it much\n easier to manage your files and projects on GitHub.\n\n### Getting Started: Installation and Setup\n\n1.  **Create\n a GitHub Account:**\n    *   Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free\n account. This is your identity on GitHub.\n\n2.  **Download and Install GitHub Desktop:**\n    *   \nGo to the [GitHub Desktop website](https://desktop.github.com/) and download the application for your operating system\n (Windows or macOS).\n    *   Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.\n\n3.  **Connect\n Your GitHub Account:**\n    *   When you first open GitHub Desktop, it will ask you to sign in to your GitHub\n.com account.\n    *   Enter the username and password you created in step 1.\n    *   You\n'll also be asked to configure Git. This is the underlying technology that GitHub uses. You can just accept the default settings\n.\n\n### Core Concepts for Beginners\n\nHere are the most important terms you'll need to know:\n\n*   **Repository\n (or \"Repo\"):** This is just a fancy word for a project's folder. It contains all of your project's\n files and the entire revision history.\n*   **Cloning a Repository:** This means creating a copy of a repository from\n GitHub onto your local computer.\n*   **Making a Commit:** A \"commit\" is like a snapshot of your files\n at a specific point in time. When you make a commit, you're saving your changes. Each commit has a message\n that describes the changes you made.\n*   **Pushing Changes:** This is how you send your committed changes from your local\n computer up to the repository on GitHub.\n*   **Branch:** A branch is a separate version of your repository.\n You can create a branch to work on new ideas without changing the main version of your project. This is useful for experimenting\n.\n*   **Pull Request:** A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. You're requesting\n that the project owner \"pull\" your changes into their project.\n\n### A Simple Workflow: Your First Project\n\nLet\n's walk through a common scenario: you want to download a project from GitHub, make a change to a file, and save\n that change back to GitHub.\n\n1.  **Clone a Repository:**\n    *   On the GitHub website, find a\n repository you want to work with.\n    *   Click the green \"<> Code\" button.\n    *   \nClick the \"Open with GitHub Desktop\" button. This will open GitHub Desktop and ask you where you want to save the project on\n your computer.\n\n2.  **Make a Change:**\n    *   Find the project folder on your computer.\n    *\n   Open one of the files in your favorite editor (like Notepad, Word, or any other program).\n    *\n   Make a small change to the file and save it.\n\n3.  **Commit Your Change:**\n    *\n   Open GitHub Desktop. You'll see your changes in the \"Changes\" tab.\n    *   At the bottom of\n the screen, you'll see a \"Summary\" and \"Description\" box. Type a short summary of your change\n in the \"Summary\" box.\n    *   Click the \"Commit to main\" button. This saves your changes.\n\n\n4.  **Push Your Change to GitHub:**\n    *   At the top of the GitHub Desktop window, you\n'll see a \"Push origin\" button. Click it. This will upload your committed changes to the repository on GitHub.\n\n\nThat's it! You've successfully used GitHub Desktop to update a project.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGitHub Desktop is\n a powerful tool that makes it easy to work with projects on GitHub, even if you're not a programmer. By\n understanding the basic concepts of repositories, cloning, committing, and pushing, you can start using GitHub to manage your own projects and collaborate with\n others.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769684077568-1e7633a65b06b","status":"completed","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684090513-3ac1cc28d934e","status":"completed","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-contents-1769684095613-e7a97b863d2cb8","status":"completed","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-contents-1769684106957-8e44b2a658d708","status":"completed","timestamp":58924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-contents-1769684112314-f4292b3b89ad98","status":"completed","timestamp":58924},{"type":"message","content":"Of course!

{"id":"websearch-1088","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?\nA 50\n0 Internal Server Error is a generic HTTP status code that indicates an unexpected server-side problem. For customer-facing REST\n API endpoints, these errors can be particularly damaging to the user experience and business reputation. Below are common causes of 5\n00 errors and modern debugging strategies relevant in 2026.\n\n### Common Causes of 500 Errors\n in REST API Customer Endpoints\n\n1.  **Unhandled Application Exceptions:**\n    *   **Null Pointer Exceptions:** Access\ning an object that is `null`.\n    *   **Type Mismatches:** Attempting to cast an object to an\n incompatible type.\n    *   **Infinite Loops:** Code that never terminates, consuming excessive resources.\n    *   \n**Resource Leaks:** Failure to close database connections, file handles, or network connections.\n\n2.  **Database Issues\n:**\n    *   **Database Unavailability:** The database server is down or unreachable.\n    *   **Connection\n Timeouts:** The application fails to connect to the database within a specified time.\n    *   **Deadlocks:** Two\n or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, causing a standstill.\n    *   **Data Integrity Viol\nations:** Attempting to insert or update data that violates database constraints (e.g., foreign key constraints).\n\n3.  **\nExternal Service Failures:**\n    *   **Third-Party API Outages:** A dependent service (e.g.,\n payment gateway, email service) is unavailable.\n    *   **API Timeouts:** A dependent service takes too long\n to respond.\n    *   **Unexpected API Responses:** A dependent service returns an unexpected response format or an error that\n the application cannot handle.\n\n4.  **Infrastructure and Configuration Problems:**\n    *   **Insufficient Server Resources:** The\n server runs out of memory, CPU, or disk space.\n    *   **Misconfigurations:** Incorrect settings in configuration\n files, such as database connection strings or file paths.\n    *   **Load Balancer Issues:** A misconfigured load balancer\n might route traffic to an unhealthy server instance.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Problems with network connectivity between services\n.\n\n### How to Debug 500 Errors in 2026\n\nIn 2026, debugging has\n evolved to be more proactive and automated, relying on a suite of powerful tools and methodologies.\n\n1.  **Central\nized and Structured Logging:**\n    *   **What to Log:** Implement structured logging to record detailed information about each request in\n a machine-readable format like JSON. Include a unique `request_id` in every log entry to trace a request's entire\n lifecycle. For 500 errors, log the full stack trace, request headers, and request body (with sensitive\n customer data redacted).\n    *   **Modern Tools:** Utilize cloud-native logging platforms like **Datadog,\n Splunk, or the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**. These platforms offer advanced search\n, filtering, and visualization capabilities. By 2026, they will be heavily infused with AI for anomaly detection and automated\n log pattern analysis.\n\n2.  **Distributed Tracing:**\n    *   **How it Works:** In a\n microservices architecture, a single user request can trigger a cascade of calls to multiple services. Distributed tracing provides a unified view of the entire\n request flow, allowing you to pinpoint which service is failing and identify performance bottlenecks.\n    *   **Modern Tools:** **\nOpenTelemetry** has become the industry standard for instrumenting applications for tracing. Platforms like **Jaeger, Zipkin, Honey\ncomb, and Lightstep** provide powerful visualization and analysis of trace data.\n\n3.  **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)\n and AIOps:**\n    *   **What it is:** APM tools provide deep insights into your application's performance,\n monitoring everything from code execution time to database query performance. AIOps (AI for IT Operations) platforms leverage machine learning\n to automate the detection, diagnosis, and even resolution of issues.\n    *   **Modern Tools:** APM solutions like **\nNew Relic and AppDynamics** have matured to include sophisticated AIOps capabilities. In 2026, these\n tools can automatically correlate data from logs, traces, and metrics to identify the root cause of 500 errors and,\n in some cases, trigger automated remediation actions.\n\n4.  **Comprehensive Error Handling and Reporting:**\n    *   **\nGraceful Error Handling:** Implement a global exception handler to catch all unhandled exceptions. This ensures that the application always returns a standardized and\n user-friendly error response, rather than crashing. The response should include the unique `request_id` to facilitate debugging\n.\n    *   **Automated Error Reporting:** Integrate your application with error reporting services like **Sentry or Bug\nsnag**. These services automatically capture and aggregate exceptions, providing detailed reports with stack traces, request context, and historical data\n.\n\n5.  **Proactive Debugging in CI/CD:**\n    *   **Chaos Engineering:** Pro\nactively inject failures into pre-production environments to test the system's resilience and identify weaknesses that could lead to 500\n errors.\n    *   **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:** Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic\n application security testing (DAST) tools into your CI/CD pipeline to identify potential bugs and security vulnerabilities before they reach\n production.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?","timestamp":52169},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":52169},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769684150562-b19a960edcb3e","status":"completed","timestamp":52169},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":52169},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684166432-e9080304e8a56","status":"completed","timestamp":52169},{"type":"message","content":"A 50","timestamp":52169},{"type":"message","content":"0 Internal Server Error is a generic HTTP status code that indicates an unexpected server-side problem.

{"id":"websearch-1267","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial\nHere is\n a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo:\n\n###\n 1. Create a new Turborepo project\n\nYou can start by using the official Turborepo `create-\nturbo` command, which sets up a new monorepo with a default structure. Open your terminal and run:\n\n\n```bash\n\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n\n```\n\n\nWhen prompted, you can choose a name for your project and select the\n `pnpm` package manager, which is recommended for monorepos.\n\n### 2. Create a shared UI package\n\n\nTo share UI components across your applications, it's best to create a dedicated package for them. If one doesn't already\n exist, you can create a `ui` package inside the `packages` directory.\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/ui\n\n\n```\n\n\nInside `packages/ui`, create a `package.json` file with the following content:\n\n\n```json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./tailwind-config\": \"./tailwind.config.\nts\",\n    \"./button\": \"./src/button.tsx\",\n    \"./card\": \"./src/card.tsx\",\n\n    \"./*\": [\n      \"./src/components/*\",\n      \"./src/components/ui/*\"\n\n    ]\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"eslint . --max-warnings \n0\",\n    \"generate:component\": \"turbo gen react-component\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n\n    \"react\": \"^18.2.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@\nrepo/eslint-config\": \"*\",\n    \"@repo/typescript-config\": \"*\",\n    \"@types/react\":\n \"^18.2.61\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18.2.1\n9\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.18\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8.5\n7.0\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.4.35\",\n    \"react\": \"^18.\n2.0\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.3.3\n\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS\n\nFor a consistent styling system, you should\n have a shared Tailwind CSS configuration.\n\nFirst, install the necessary dependencies in the root of your monorepo:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm add -w tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @repo/tailwind-config\n```\n\n\nNext\n, create a `tailwind.config.ts` file in the `packages/tailwind-config` directory with the following content:\n\n\n\n```typescript\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  content: [\n    \n\"./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\",\n    \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\",\n  ],\n\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n};\n\nexport default config\n;\n\n```\n\n\nThen, in each of your applications (e.g., `apps/web`), create a \n`tailwind.config.ts` that imports the shared configuration:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\n\nimport sharedConfig from \"@repo/tailwind-config\";\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  content: [\n    \n\"./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\",\n    \"../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\",\n  ],\n\n  presets: [sharedConfig],\n};\n\nexport default config;\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Initialize shad\ncn/ui\n\nNow, you can initialize shadcn/ui in your `ui` package. Navigate to the `packages\n/ui` directory and run the following command:\n\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shad\ncn-ui@latest init\n\n```\n\n\nYou will be prompted to answer a few questions about your project setup. Here\n's a recommended configuration:\n\n-   **Which style would you like to use?** `Default`\n-   **\nWhich color would you like to use as base color?** `Slate`\n-   **Where is your global CSS file?**\n `src/styles/globals.css`\n-   **Do you want to use CSS variables for colors?** `Yes\n`\n-   **Where is your tailwind.config.js located?** `../../packages/tailwind-config\n/tailwind.config.ts`\n-   **Configure import alias for components:** `@/components`\n-   **Configure import\n alias for utils:** `@/lib/utils`\n-   **Are you using React Server Components?** `No`\n\n-   **Write configuration to components.json.** `Yes`\n\n### 5. Add components\n\nOnce shadcn/ui is\n initialized, you can add components to your `ui` package. To do this, run the `add` command from\n within the `packages/ui` directory:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add\n button\n\n```\n\n\nThis will add the `Button` component to your `packages/ui/src/components/ui` directory.\n\n\n### 6. Use the shared components in your application\n\nFinally, you can use the shared components in your applications.\n\n\nFirst, make sure your application's `package.json` includes the `ui` package as a dependency:\n\n\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"@repo/ui\": \"*\"\n}\n```\n\n\nThen, in your application\n's code, you can import and use the components:\n\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/button\n\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Web</h1>\n      <Button>Click\n me</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully set up shad\ncn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo, allowing you to build and maintain a consistent and scalable UI component\n library for all of your applications.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":23091},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":23091},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684545198-1422b31c9f5058","status":"completed","timestamp":23091},{"type":"message","content":"Here is","timestamp":23091},{"type":"message","content":" a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo:\n\n###","timestamp":23091},{"type":"message","content":" 1.

{"id":"websearch-1268","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server in 2026?\nBased on the latest information for 2026\n, here is a guide on how to set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server.\n\n### What is the Meet\nGeek MCP Server?\n\nThe MeetGeek MCP Server is a local application that runs on your computer. It acts as a\n bridge, allowing your local AI assistants and tools (like Claude, Cursor, or LobeChat) to securely access the\n data from your MeetGeek meetings, such as transcripts, summaries, and action items. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n to communicate with these tools. Because it runs locally, your meeting data remains on your machine.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore\n you begin, you will need a MeetGeek API key. You can get this from your MeetGeek account settings\n.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\nYou can run the MeetGeek MCP server using Docker (recommended) or by running the\n source code directly.\n\n**1. Get your MeetGeek API Key:**\n   - Log in to your Meet\nGeek account.\n   - Navigate to your account settings or developer section to find your API key.\n\n**2. Set\n up the server:**\n\n*   **Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)**\n    1.  Make sure you have Docker\n installed on your system.\n    2.  Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing `YOUR\n_API_KEY` with your actual MeetGeek API key:\n        \n```bash\n        docker run -d\n -p 3333:3333 -e MEETGEEK_API_KEY=YOUR_\nAPI_KEY --name meetgeek-mcp-server meetgeek/mcp-server\n        \n```\n\n    \n3. The server will now be running locally and listening on port 3333.\n\n*   **Option\n B: Running from Source**\n    1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.\n    2.\n  Clone the official GitHub repository:\n        \n```bash\n        git clone https://github.com/meetgeekai/\nmeetgeek-mcp-server.git\n        \n```\n\n    3.  Navigate into the project directory:\n        \n```bash\n\n        cd meetgeek-mcp-server\n        \n```\n\n    4.  Install the dependencies:\n        \n```bash\n        npm install\n        ```\n\n    5.  Start the server, providing your API key as an environment variable:\n\n        \n```bash\n        MEETGEEK_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY npm start\n        \n```\n\n    6. The server will now be running locally and listening on port 3333.\n\n### Usage\n\n\nOnce the server is running, you need to configure your AI tool or client to connect to it.\n\n1.  Open\n the settings or configuration panel of your MCP-compatible AI tool (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Lobe\nChat).\n2.  Find the section for MCP or tool integration.\n3.  Add a new MCP server with\n the following details:\n    *   **Server URL** or **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:333\n3`\n4.  Save the configuration.\n\nYour AI tool can now access your MeetGeek meeting data.\n You can start asking it questions about your past meetings, have it generate summaries, or ask it to find action items for\n you.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official resources:\n\n*   **MeetGeek Help Center\n:** [https://support.meetgeek.ai/en/articles/11939580-\nmcp-server](https://support.meetgeek.ai/en/articles/119395\n80-mcp-server)\n*   **Official GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/meetgeekai/\nmeetgeek-mcp-server](https://github.com/meetgeekai/meetgeek-mcp-\nserver)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server in 2026?","timestamp":30689},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":30689},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":30689},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684586987-74906a11f0c538","status":"completed","timestamp":30689},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769684587007-0486afbb7d429","status":"completed","timestamp":30689},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest information for 2026","timestamp":30689},{"type":"message","content":", here is a guide on how to set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server.\n\n### What is the Meet","timestamp":30689},{"type":"message","content":"Geek MCP Server?\n\nThe MeetGeek MCP Server is a local application that runs on your computer.

{"id":"websearch-1330","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026\nHere is a guide on how to build a full-\nwidth responsive image slider using the Next.js Image component and Swiper in 2026.\n\n### 1\n. Install Swiper\n\nFirst, you need to add Swiper to your project:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install sw\niper\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Create the Image Slider Component\n\nCreate a new file, for example, `components/ImageSlider\n.js`. This component will be a client component because it uses hooks and event listeners.\n\n\n```javascript\n// components/ImageSlider\n.js\n'use client';\n\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide }\n from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay } from 'swiper/modules';\n\n// Import Sw\niper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css\n/pagination';\n\nconst ImageSlider = ({ images }) => {\n  return (\n    <Swiper\n      modules={[Navigation\n, Pagination, Autoplay]}\n      spaceBetween={50}\n      slidesPerView={1}\n      navigation\n      pagination={{ clickable\n: true }}\n      autoplay={{ delay: 3000 }}\n      loop={true}\n      style={{ width\n: '100%', height: '100vh' }}\n    >\n      {images.map\n((image, index) => (\n        <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n          <div style={{ width:\n '100%', height: '100%', position: 'relative' }}>\n            <Image\n              \nsrc={image.src}\n              alt={image.alt}\n              fill\n              style={{ objectFit: 'cover\n' }}\n              sizes=\"100vw\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </SwiperSlide>\n\n      ))}\n    </Swiper>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ImageSlider;\n\n```\n\n\n###\n 3. Using the Image Slider Component\n\nNow you can use the `ImageSlider` component in any of your pages.\n For example, in your `app/page.js`:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport ImageSlider from '../components/ImageSlider\n';\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  const images = [\n    { src: '/images/slide1.jpg',\n alt: 'Slide 1' },\n    { src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: '\nSlide 2' },\n    { src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3\n' },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ImageSlider images={images} />\n    \n</div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\nMake sure you have images in your `public/images` directory.\n\n\n### Key points:\n\n*   **`'use client';`**: This is essential to mark the component as a\n client component.\n*   **`next/image`**: We use the `fill` prop to make the image fill\n the container, and `object-fit: 'cover'` to maintain aspect ratio. `sizes=\"100vw\"` tells\n Next.js that the image will be full-width of the viewport.\n*   **Swiper Styles**: We\n import the necessary CSS files from the `swiper` package.\n*   **Full Width and Height**: The inline styles on\n the `Swiper` component and the `div` inside `SwiperSlide` ensure that the slider takes up the full\n viewport height. You can adjust this to your needs.\n*   **Swiper Modules**: We are using `Navigation`,\n `Pagination`, and `Autoplay` modules to add common slider features.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":23694},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":23694},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684700266-49e6e83f995ca8","status":"completed","timestamp":23694},{"type":"message","content":"Here is a guide on how to build a full-","timestamp":23695},{"type":"message","content":"width responsive image slider using the Next.js Image component and Swiper in 2026.\n\n### 1","timestamp":23695},{"type":"message","content":".

By 2025, the\n field is expected to have matured from analyzing monolingual models to actively steering large-scale multilingual ones.\n\n### \n1. Extracting Cross-Lingual Features with Sparse Autoencoders\n\nThe first step is to understand the model's internal representations\n. Researchers will train massive SAEs on the activation layers of multilingual models like GPT-4 or its successors. The key\n findings here will be:\n\n*   **Discovery of Abstract, Multilingual Features:** As suggested by research in 202\n4, SAEs are effective at finding \"monosemantic\" features that are abstract and not tied to a single\n language. For example, an SAE would be able to isolate a single feature direction in the model's activation space that\n represents the concept of \"justice,\" \"gratitude,\" or \"family,\" regardless of whether the input text is in English\n, Spanish, or Japanese.\n*   **Identification of Language-Specific Features:** In addition to universal concepts, the SAE\n will also identify features that are strongly associated with a specific language. For instance, there will be features that activate strongly for\n text that is grammatically and stylistically \"French\" or \"German.\"\n\n### 2. Steering Model Behavior with Feature-\nGuided Techniques\n\nOnce you have this dictionary of interpretable features (both cross-lingual and language-specific), you can use them to\n control the model's output during inference. The process would look like this:\n\n1.  **Identify a Target Feature:** You\n would select the feature you want to promote. For example, you might select the feature corresponding to \"formality in Japanese\" or the\n feature for the \"Spanish language.\"\n2.  **Construct a Steering Vector:** The vector corresponding to this feature in\n the SAE's decoder is your \"steering vector.\" By 2025, techniques like **Feature Guided Activation Additions (\nFGAA)** will likely be used to create precise and clean steering vectors that minimize side effects.\n3.  **Apply\n the Vector during Inference:** As the model generates a response, you would add this steering vector to the model's residual stream\n at a specific layer (research indicates mid-to-late layers are most effective). This addition \"nudges\" the model\n's internal state, making it much more likely to produce output that aligns with the chosen feature.\n\n### Concrete Use\n Cases in 2025\n\nThis approach would unlock several powerful applications for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models:\n\n*   **\nZero-Shot Language Control:** You could force a model to generate text in a specific language without ever mentioning the language in the prompt\n. For instance, you could give the model an English prompt but add the steering vector for \"Vietnamese,\" causing it\n to generate a response in Vietnamese. This is a powerful form of control for multilingual generation.\n*   **Fine-G\nrained Stylistic Control in Translation:** Instead of just translating text, you could steer the *style* of the translation.\n You could make a translation more formal or informal, or even steer it towards a specific dialect by amplifying the relevant feature.\n*   \n**Analyzing Conceptual Differences Across Languages:** By comparing the activation patterns of abstract features, you could mechanistically analyze how the model represents\n concepts differently across cultures. For example, does the feature for \"freedom\" activate on the same inputs in English and Mandarin\n, or are there subtle differences that reveal underlying biases in the training data?\n*   **Mitigating Bias:** If\n you can identify features corresponding to harmful stereotypes (e.g., a feature that links a specific nationality to a negative trait), you could\n potentially \"ablate\" or suppress this feature during inference to create a less biased model, a technique explored in papers like \"Pro\nbing Religion, Violence, and Geography.\"\n\nIn summary, by 2025, using SAEs for feature\n steering will have evolved into a practical toolkit for interpreting, controlling, and refining the behavior of sophisticated multilingual models. It represents\n a shift from passive observation to active, causal intervention in the model's reasoning process.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use SAE feature steering for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models in 2025?","timestamp":37951},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":37951},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684763728-93ba343508717","status":"completed","timestamp":37951},{"type":"message","content":"Based on current research trajectories and plausible developments, here's how you could likely use SAE (Sparse Autoencoder) feature steering","timestamp":37951},{"type":"message","content":" for mechanistic interpretability in multilingual models in 2025.\n\nThe core idea is to move from simply observing","timestamp":37951},{"type":"message","content":" what a model represents to actively controlling its behavior in a precise and interpretable way.

The `onChange` event is the standard and\n most reliable way to capture when a form element's value changes, regardless of whether the user clicks it with a mouse,\n taps it on a touch screen, or toggles it using a keyboard (like pressing the spacebar).\n\nHere is\n the recommended approach:\n\n1.  **Manage State with `useState`**: Control the checkbox's checked status using a\n state variable.\n2.  **Use `onChange` on the Input**: Update the state within the `onChange\n` event handler.\n3.  **Connect Label and Input**: Associate the `<label>` with the `<input>` using\n the `htmlFor` (for JSX) attribute on the label and a matching `id` on the input.

{"id":"websearch-1548","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024\nLoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing is an advanced process injection technique that combines elements of DLL loading, memory\n hollowing, and module stomping to execute malicious code within the address space of a legitimate process in a stealthy manner\n. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n*   **Process Hollowing:** This\n technique involves creating a new process in a suspended state, unmapping its original code from memory, and replacing it with malicious\n code. When the process is resumed, it executes the malicious code instead of the legitimate code.\n\n*   **DLL Injection\n:** This is a method of forcing a process to load and execute code from a dynamic-link library (DLL). A\n common, non-malicious way to do this is by using the `LoadLibrary` or `LoadLibraryEx` Windows\n API functions. Malicious DLL injection often involves more covert methods to load the DLL.\n\n*   **Module Stomping/\nDLL Hollowing:** This is a variation of process hollowing where, instead of hollowing the main executable's memory\n, the attacker hollows out the memory of a legitimate DLL that is already loaded into the process.\n\n*   **Dec\noy:** In this context, a decoy is a legitimate file (in this case, a DLL) that is used to deceive\n security software and analysts.\n\n### The Attack Process\n\nThe LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection technique unfolds\n in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Target Process Creation:** The attacker first creates a new, legitimate process in a\n suspended state. Starting the process as suspended prevents it from executing any code before the attacker has had a chance to modify its\n memory.\n\n2.  **Decoy DLL Loading with `LoadLibraryEx`:** The attacker then uses the `Load\nLibraryEx` function to load a legitimate, non-malicious DLL into the memory space of the suspended process. This is the\n \"decoy\" aspect of the technique. Because a legitimate function is used to load a legitimate DLL, this action is less likely to\n be flagged as suspicious by security software that monitors for process injection. The loaded DLL will also appear in the process's list\n of loaded modules in the Process Environment Block (PEB), making the process's memory layout appear normal.\n\n3.\n  **Memory Hollowing of the Decoy DLL:** Once the decoy DLL is loaded and mapped into the process's memory, the\n attacker unmaps or \"hollows out\" the memory region occupied by the DLL's code. This is typically\n done using functions like `NtUnmapViewOfSection` or `ZwUnmapViewOfSection`. The decoy DLL'\ns entry in the PEB's loaded module list is often left intact to maintain the illusion of legitimacy.\n\n4.\n  **Allocation of New Memory:** The attacker then allocates a new region of memory within the process at the same address where\n the decoy DLL was previously located. This is typically done with `VirtualAllocEx`.\n\n5.  **Writing the\n Malicious Payload:** The attacker writes their malicious code (the payload) into this newly allocated memory region using a function like `Write\nProcessMemory`.\n\n6.  **Fixing Memory Permissions and Relocations:** The attacker adjusts the memory permissions of\n the newly written payload to make it executable. If necessary, they will also perform any required relocations for the payload to\n execute correctly in its new memory location.\n\n7.  **Execution Redirection:** The attacker then needs to redirect the execution\n flow of the process to their malicious code. This can be achieved in several ways, such as:\n    *   **\nModifying the Entry Point:** The attacker can modify the process's main entry point to point to the malicious code.\n\n    *   **Thread Hijacking:** The attacker can hijack the main thread of the suspended process and change its instruction\n pointer to point to the malicious code.\n\n8.  **Resuming the Process:** Finally, the attacker resumes the suspended process\n using a function like `ResumeThread`. The process then begins execution, but instead of running the legitimate code, it runs\n the attacker's malicious payload, which is now hidden within the memory space that was once occupied by the decoy DLL.\n\n###\n Why This Technique is Effective and Stealthy\n\n*   **Evasion of Static Analysis:** Because the initial actions involve a legitimate process\n loading a legitimate DLL, static analysis of the malicious loader may not reveal the full extent of the attack.\n\n*   **B\nypassing Behavioral Analysis:** The use of `LoadLibraryEx` to load a decoy DLL can appear as normal program behavior, thus\n bypassing some behavioral analysis tools.\n\n*   **Hiding in Plain Sight:** The malicious code resides in a memory region that is\n supposed to be occupied by a legitimate DLL. Security software that inspects the process's loaded module list might see the decoy DLL and\n not investigate further.\n\n*   **Fileless Execution:** The malicious payload is executed directly from memory and is never written to disk,\n making it more difficult to detect with traditional file-based antivirus scanners.\n\nIn summary, LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory\n hollowing is a sophisticated, multi-stage attack that leverages legitimate Windows functionality to create a stealthy and effective method of\n process injection. It is a prime example of how attackers are constantly evolving their techniques to bypass modern security controls.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","timestamp":27285},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":27285},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685233421-0d0dc2458fae6","status":"completed","timestamp":27285},{"type":"message","content":"LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing is an advanced process injection technique that combines elements of DLL loading, memory","timestamp":27285},{"type":"message","content":" hollowing, and module stomping to execute malicious code within the address space of a legitimate process in a stealthy manner","timestamp":27285},{"type":"message","content":".

Serverless AI Inference at the Edge\nThis pattern involves deploying AI models,\n particularly generative AI, to edge computing environments like Cloudflare Workers. By using AI bindings, developers can easily access these models from their server\nless functions without managing API keys or complex infrastructure. This brings AI capabilities closer to the user, reducing latency and improving performance\n.\n\n*   **Example:** A website with a customer support chatbot that uses a large language model running on the edge\n network. The website's JavaScript code, running in a Cloudflare Worker, uses an AI binding to communicate with the model.\n This allows the chatbot to respond to customer queries with very low latency.\n\n### 2. Simple Tool Binding for Automation\nThis is\n a more direct and straightforward pattern where a specific tool or function is \"bound\" to an AI model. This allows the\n AI to use the tool to perform a specific, well-defined task.\n\n*   **Example:** A Slack bot that can\n create a new entry in a project management tool. When a user types \"/create-task Finish the report,\" the bot\n, powered by an AI model, uses a tool binding to call the project management tool's API and create the task.\n\n###\n 3. Agentic Workflows for Autonomous Tasks\nThis is a more advanced pattern where AI agents are given a degree of autonomy to\n complete multi-step tasks. Instead of just using a single tool, the agent can reason, make decisions, and use multiple tools\n in a sequence to achieve a goal.\n\n*   **Example:** A personal travel assistant AI. The user tells the assistant, \"\nBook a trip to London for next week.\" The AI agent can then use different tool bindings to:\n    *   Search for flights\n.\n    *   Find and book a hotel.\n    *   Add the travel itinerary to the user's calendar.\n\n    *   Send a confirmation email.\n\n### 4. Multi-Agent Collaboration\nThis is a highly sophisticated pattern where multiple\n AI agents work together to accomplish complex goals. Each agent may have a specialized role, and they collaborate by passing information and tasks to each\n other.\n\n*   **Example:** A team of AI agents building a new software feature.\n    *   **\nAgent 1 (Product Manager):** Takes the user's request for a new feature and breaks it down into smaller\n tasks.\n    *   **Agent 2 (Software Engineer):** Writes the code for the new feature.\n\n    *   **Agent 3 (QA Engineer):** Tests the code written by the engineer agent.\n    *   \n**Agent 4 (Project Manager):** Oversees the entire process, ensuring that the feature is delivered on time.\n\n\n### 5. Specialized Bindings for Media and Data Manipulation\nThis pattern involves using bindings to access specialized services for tasks like image\n processing, data analysis, or other computationally intensive operations.\n\n*   **Example:** A social media platform that allows users to upload images\n. When a user uploads an image, a Cloudflare Worker uses an \"Images\" binding to automatically resize the image to\n different formats (thumbnail, preview, full-size) and apply a watermark. This is done programmatically, without the\n need for a separate image processing service.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","timestamp":25281},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":25281},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685346990-ae9cf15fac54b8","status":"completed","timestamp":25281},{"type":"message","content":"Based","timestamp":25281},{"type":"message","content":" on current trends and developments, here are some examples of Workers AI binding usage patterns we can expect to see in 2","timestamp":25281},{"type":"message","content":"026:\n\n### 1.

In older versions, SQLAlchemy would implicitly\n interpret a raw string as an executable SQL statement. This behavior was deprecated in version 1.4 and completely removed in version\n 2.0 to make the execution process more explicit and secure.\n\nThe `execute()` method in modern SQLAlchemy expects a construct\n that is clearly defined as an executable SQL clause, such as one created by the ORM, the SQL Expression Language, or the\n `text()` construct. A plain Python string is no longer considered an executable object, which leads to the `ObjectNotExecutableError\n`.\n\n### How to Fix it with `text()`\n\nTo resolve this, you must explicitly mark your raw SQL string\n as a SQL statement that is safe to execute. You do this by wrapping it with the `text()` construct, which must be imported\n from SQLAlchemy.\n\nThis wrapper signals to SQLAlchemy that you are intentionally executing a literal SQL query.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\n1.  **Import `text`**: First, import the `text` function from the `sqlalchemy` library.\n\n\n    \n```python\n    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text\n    ```\n\n\n2.  **Wrap the SQL\n String**: When you call the execute method, wrap your raw SQL query string within the `text()` function.\n\n    \n**Incorrect code (that causes the error):**\n    \n```python\n    # This will raise ObjectNotExecutableError in\n SQLAlchemy 2.x\n    results = db_connection.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1\")\n    \n```\n\n\n    **Corrected code:**\n    \n```python\n    # Import the text function\n    from sqlalchemy import text\n\n\n    # Wrap the raw SQL string in text()\n    sql_query = text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE\n id = :user_id\")\n\n    # Execute the query, passing parameters safely\n    with engine.connect() as\n db_connection:\n        results = db_connection.execute(sql_query, {\"user_id\": 1})\n\n        for row in results:\n            print(row)\n\n    \n```\n\n\nBy using `text()`, you not only fix\n the `ObjectNotExecutableError` but also align your code with modern SQLAlchemy 2.x practices, making it clearer\n and less prone to SQL injection vulnerabilities, especially when using parameters as shown above.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat causes ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x when executing raw SQL and how to fix it with text() wrapper in 2026?","timestamp":19106},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":19106},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685387810-6cbb5e03cdb838","status":"completed","timestamp":19106},{"type":"message","content":"In SQLAlchemy 2.x, the `ObjectNotExecutableError` arises","timestamp":19106},{"type":"message","content":" when you attempt to execute a raw SQL string directly with methods like `session.execute()` or `connection.execute()`.\n\n","timestamp":19106},{"type":"message","content":"### Cause of the Error\n\nThis error is intentional in SQLAlchemy 2.x.

This library provides an asynchronous, unencrypted, persistent, key-value storage system for your application.\n\nHere’\ns how to use it:\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nFirst, you need to add the `async-storage\n` library to your Expo project.

Use a Community Plugin (Easiest Method\n)\n\nThis is the most straightforward approach. Plugins like **JSON to Design Wizard** or **JSON to Figma** are designed\n for this purpose.\n\nThe general workflow is:\n\n1.  **Prepare your JSON**: Make sure your JSON data\n is structured. The keys in your JSON (e.g., \"productName\", \"price\") will be used to map\n data to your layers.\n2.  **Name your Figma layers**: In your design, name the layers you want to\n populate with the same names as the keys in your JSON file.

The dialog's visibility is controlled by the \n`showCronDialog` reactive variable.\n5.  **v-model**: The `cronExpression` is bound to the `<\ncron-element-plus>` component using `v-model`. Any changes made in the cron editor will automatically update the \n`cronExpression` value.\n6.  **Display Value**: The selected cron expression is displayed in real-time below\n the input field.\n7.  **Icon Button**: An `<el-button>` with the `Clock` icon from\n `@element-plus/icons-vue` is used to open the dialog, providing a better user experience. You may need to install\n the icons package if you haven't already:\n    \n```bash\n    npm install @element-plus/icons-vue\n\n    \n```\n\n\nThis setup provides a clean and modern UI for cron expression editing within a Vue 3 and Element Plus application.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use vite-plugin-vue-cron with Vue 3 and Element Plus in 2026","timestamp":31739},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":31739},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685702877-3fcc08d19cfd68","status":"completed","timestamp":31739},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685708538-0bf33855a4089","status":"completed","timestamp":31739},{"type":"message","content":"As of 2026, to use a cron job editor with Vue 3 and Element Plus","timestamp":31739},{"type":"message","content":", the recommended library is `@vue-js-cron/element-plus`.

{"id":"websearch-1761","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026\nIn 2026, using the `ExtractedEntities` response model in `graph\niti` involves defining your own custom entity types as Pydantic models. `graphiti` then uses its internal `ExtractedEntities\n` model to validate the entities extracted by the Language Model (LLM) based on your custom definitions.\n\nHere’\ns a breakdown of how it works, with a code example:\n\n### 1. Define Your Custom Entity Types\n\nFirst, you\n define the entities you want to extract from your text using Pydantic models. This allows you to specify the structure of your\n domain-specific entities.\n\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass Person(BaseModel):\n\n    \"\"\"A person entity.\"\"\"\n    name: str = Field(..., description=\"The name of the person.\")\n\n\nclass Organization(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"An organization entity.\"\"\"\n    name: str = Field(..., description=\"The\n name of the organization.\")\n\n# A list of your custom entity types\nCUSTOM_ENTITY_TYPES = [Person, Organization]\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Use `graphiti` to Extract Entities\n\nNext, you initialize `graphiti` and\n use it to process your text. When you add an \"episode\" (a piece of text), `graphiti\n` will use the LLM to identify and extract entities that match your custom Pydantic models.\n\n\n```python\nimport\n asyncio\nfrom graphiti import Graphiti\n\nasync def main():\n    # Initialize Graphiti\n    graphiti = Graphiti\n()\n\n    # Define the text to process\n    text = \"John Doe is a software engineer at Example Corp.\"\n\n    #\n Add the text as an episode and extract entities\n    await graphiti.add_episode(\n        name=\"employee\n_record\",\n        episode_body=text,\n        custom_entity_types=CUSTOM_ENTITY_TYPES,\n\n    )\n\n    # You can then query the graph for the extracted entities\n    # (Querying logic depends on your\n graph database setup)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n\n```\n\n\n\n### The Role of `ExtractedEntities`\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` model is used internally by `graphiti` to validate\n the response from the LLM. You don't typically interact with it directly. Its structure is essentially a list of the\n entities that were extracted, and it looks something like this (based on bug reports and library behavior):\n\n\n```python\nfrom\n typing import List\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass ExtractedEntity(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n\n    entity_type_id: int\n\nclass ExtractedEntities(BaseModel):\n    extracted_entities: List\n[ExtractedEntity]\n\n```\n\n\nWhen `graphiti` processes the text, the LLM returns a list of entities it\n found. `graphiti` then validates this list against the `ExtractedEntities` model. If the validation is successful, the\n entities are added to the knowledge graph. If not, you'll encounter a validation error, as seen in the bug\n reports you might find online.\n\n### In Summary\n\nTo use entity extraction in `graphiti` in 20\n26, you should:\n\n1.  **Define your custom entities** as Pydantic models.\n2.\n  **Pass these custom types** to the `add_episode` method.\n3.  Let **`graphiti\n` handle the interaction** with the `ExtractedEntities` model for validation.\n\nThis approach allows you to work with your\n own domain-specific data structures while `graphiti` manages the underlying validation and graph creation process.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026","timestamp":35920},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":35920},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685755270-b4f6698a2ac088","status":"completed","timestamp":35920},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685762279-c10e413f9da608","status":"completed","timestamp":35920},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685767810-c4ca3762644a3","status":"completed","timestamp":35920},{"type":"message","content":"In 2026, using the `ExtractedEntities` response model in `graph","timestamp":35920},{"type":"message","content":"iti` involves defining your own custom entity types as Pydantic models. `graphiti` then uses its internal `ExtractedEntities","timestamp":35920},{"type":"message","content":"` model to validate the entities extracted by the Language Model (LLM) based on your custom definitions.\n\nHere’","timestamp":35920},{"type":"message","content":"s a breakdown of how it works, with a code example:\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1764","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?\nDetecting and preventing proxy\n rotation attacks on e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026 requires a sophisticated, multi-layered approach that\n goes beyond simple IP blacklisting. Attackers are increasingly using residential and mobile proxies to mimic legitimate user behavior, making detection\n more challenging. Here’s a breakdown of modern detection and prevention strategies:\n\n### **Detection**\n\nThe key to detection\n is to look for patterns and anomalies in user behavior and technical fingerprints, rather than just relying on IP addresses.\n\n1\n.  **AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis:**\n    *   **User Interaction Analysis:** Sophisticated systems can analyze mouse\n movements, typing speed, and browsing patterns to distinguish between human users and bots. Bots often exhibit unnaturally fast or robotic\n interactions.\n    *   **Business Logic Anomalies:** Flagging unusual activities like an account adding an excessive number of items to\n a cart, attempting multiple failed logins from different IPs in a short period, or scraping product data at an inhuman speed.\n    *\n   **Session Analysis:** Look for inconsistencies within a single user session. For example, a session that rapidly cycles through IPs\n from different geographical locations is highly suspicious.\n\n2.  **TLS and HTTP/S Fingerprinting:**\n    *   Every\n client (browser, bot, script) has a unique TLS/SSL fingerprint based on its configuration (cipher suites, extensions\n, etc.). Attackers using common libraries like `curl_cffi` or `requests` can be identified by their\n specific fingerprints.\n    *   Similarly, the structure of HTTP/S requests (header order, user-agent strings)\n can be used to create a fingerprint and identify known malicious tools.\n\n3.  **Device Fingerprinting:**\n    *\n   This goes beyond IP addresses to identify the user's device. It uses a combination of attributes like browser version, plugins\n, screen resolution, operating system, and even hardware characteristics.\n    *   If the same device fingerprint is associated with a\n large number of different IP addresses, it's a strong indicator of proxy rotation.\n\n4.  **IP Reputation Analysis:**\n\n    *   While not foolproof, it's still a valuable layer. Go beyond simple blacklists and use services that categorize\n IPs (e.g., datacenter, residential, mobile, known proxy/VPN).\n    *   A sudden\n surge in traffic from a previously unseen residential IP range could be a sign of a new proxy network being used.\n\n5\n.  **WebRTC Leak Detection:**\n    *   WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) can sometimes leak a\n user's real IP address, even if they are behind a proxy. Actively probing for WebRTC leaks can help\n unmask attackers.\n\n### **Prevention**\n\nPrevention is about creating a layered defense that makes it too costly and difficult for\n attackers to succeed.\n\n1.  **Advanced Bot Management and WAF (Web Application Firewall):**\n    *\n   Invest in a modern bot management solution that incorporates the detection techniques mentioned above (behavioral analysis, fingerprinting, etc.).\n\n    *   These solutions can challenge suspicious traffic with CAPTCHAs, rate limit them, or block them outright\n.\n    *   Your WAF should be configured to block requests with known malicious fingerprints.\n\n2.  **Multi\n-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Adaptive Authentication:**\n    *   While attackers can bypass MFA with reverse proxy phishing,\n it's still a critical defense layer.\n    *   Implement adaptive authentication, which requires additional verification steps based on risk\n signals (e.g., a new device, a login from a different country, a suspicious IP).\n\n3.  \n**API Security:**\n    *   Many attacks target APIs directly. Protect your APIs with rate limiting, authentication (e\n.g., OAuth2), and anomaly detection.\n    *   Ensure that your public APIs don't expose more\n information than necessary.\n\n4.  **Client-Side Security:**\n    *   Implement JavaScript-based challenges and\n fingerprinting on the client-side to gather more data about the user's environment. This can help you distinguish between real\n browsers and headless browsers often used by bots.\n\n5.  **Proactive Monitoring and Threat Intelligence:**\n    *   \nContinuously monitor your traffic for suspicious patterns and stay up-to-date on the latest attack techniques and proxy providers.\n    \n*   Use threat intelligence feeds to proactively block known malicious IPs and fingerprints.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no single \"\nsilver bullet\" to prevent proxy rotation attacks. A comprehensive, defense-in-depth strategy that combines advanced technical fingerprinting, AI-\npowered behavioral analysis, and robust security policies is essential for protecting e-commerce platforms in 2026.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":36026},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":36026},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769685801488-65a7e281d572c8","status":"completed","timestamp":36026},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":36026},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685813554-bdd04da0a9ee88","status":"completed","timestamp":36026},{"type":"message","content":"Detecting and preventing proxy","timestamp":36026},{"type":"message","content":" rotation attacks on e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026 requires a sophisticated, multi-layered approach that","timestamp":36026},{"type":"message","content":" goes beyond simple IP blacklisting.

{"id":"websearch-1804","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024\nSetting up a\n custom color palette for a mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS is a straightforward process. You'll primarily work within\n your `tailwind.config.js` file to define your colors and then use Tailwind's responsive prefixes in your HTML.\n\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide for 2024:\n\n### 1. Define\n Your Custom Color Palette\n\nOpen your `tailwind.config.js` file. Inside the `theme` object, you\n can extend the default palette or create an entirely new one. It's generally recommended to use the `extend` object\n to add your custom colors alongside Tailwind's defaults.\n\n\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports =\n {\n  content: [\n    './src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}',\n  ],\n  \ntheme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        'primary': '#1D4ED8\n',\n        'primary-light': '#3B82F6',\n        'primary-dark': '#1\nE3A8A',\n        'secondary': '#9333EA',\n        'accent': '#F\n59E0B',\n        'light': '#F9FAFB',\n        'dark': '#1\nF2937',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n\n```\n\n\nIn\n this example:\n*   We've defined a set of custom colors: `primary`, `secondary`, `accent\n`, `light`, and `dark`.\n*   We've also created light and dark variations for the primary color.\n\n###\n 2. Apply Colors with a Mobile-First Approach\n\nTailwind CSS is mobile-first by default. This means that\n any utility class without a responsive prefix (like `bg-primary`) will apply to all screen sizes. To change a\n style at a specific breakpoint, you use prefixes like `md:`, `lg:`, etc.\n\nHere is an example of a\n responsive button that changes its background color on medium screens and larger:\n\n\n```html\n<button class=\"bg-primary text-light\n md:bg-secondary md:text-dark font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">\n  Click\n me\n</button>\n\n```\n\n\nIn this example:\n*   `bg-primary` and `text-\nlight` are the default, mobile-first styles.\n*   `md:bg-secondary` and `md:text-\ndark` will apply on screens that are `768px` wide or larger (the default `md` breakpoint).\n\n\n### Complete Example\n\nHere is a more complete example showing a responsive card component with a custom color palette.\n\n**\n`tailwind.config.js`:**\n\n\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports =\n {\n  content: [\n    './src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}',\n  \n],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        'primary': '#1D4ED8\n',\n        'primary-light': '#3B82F6',\n        'primary-dark': '#\n1E3A8A',\n        'secondary': '#9333EA',\n        'accent':\n '#F59E0B',\n        'light': '#F9FAFB',\n        'dark':\n '#1F2937',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n**`index.html`:**\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\n\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content\n=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Tailwind Custom Colors</title>\n\n  <link href=\"/dist/output.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"\nbg-light dark:bg-dark p-8\">\n\n  <div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto bg\n-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden md:max-w-2\nxl\">\n    <div class=\"md:flex\">\n      <div class=\"md:flex-shrink-0\n\">\n        <img class=\"h-48 w-full object-cover md:h-full md:w-\n48\" src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/150\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"p-8\">\n        <div class=\"uppercase tracking-wide text-sm text-primary\n dark:text-primary-light font-semibold\">Case study</div>\n        <a href=\"#\" class=\"block mt\n-1 text-lg leading-tight font-medium text-dark dark:text-light hover:underline\">Finding\n the right color palette for your project</a>\n        <p class=\"mt-2 text-gray-500 dark\n:text-gray-400\">Getting your colors right is one of the most important parts of designing a new\n application.</p>\n        <button class=\"mt-4 bg-primary text-light md:bg-secondary\n md:text-dark font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">\n          Learn More\n        </button>\n      \n</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\n\n### Tips for 2024 and Beyond\n\n*   \n**Color Palette Generation Tools:** If you're not sure where to start with your color palette, there are several online tools that can\n help you generate a harmonious set of colors that work well with Tailwind CSS. Some popular options include [UI Colors](https://u\nicolors.app/generate) and [Tailwind Color](https://tailwindcolor.com/).\n*   **\nCSS Variables:** For more advanced use cases, you can define your colors as CSS variables in your main CSS file and reference\n them in your `tailwind.config.js`. This can be useful for dynamic theming.\n*   **Dark\n Mode:** As shown in the example above, you can use the `dark:` prefix to apply different styles when the user has dark mode\n enabled in their operating system. This is a great way to improve the user experience of your site.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","timestamp":25946},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":25946},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685931409-e90b5206ed7d6","status":"completed","timestamp":25946},{"type":"message","content":"Setting up a","timestamp":25946},{"type":"message","content":" custom color palette for a mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS is a straightforward process.

{"id":"websearch-1806","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?\nTo use the `rust-libp\n2p` relay client to dial through a relay, you need to use the `libp2p-relay` crate.\n This crate provides a `RelayTransport` that wraps your existing transport and enables it to dial through relay servers.\n\nHere is\n a conceptual example of how to use the relay client:\n\n### 1. Add `libp2p-relay` to your\n `Cargo.toml`\n\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.5\n3.2\", features = [\"full\"] }\nlibp2p-relay = \"0.21.0\"\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Create a `RelayTransport`\n\nYou need to create a `RelayTransport\n` and a `Relay` `NetworkBehaviour`. The `RelayTransport` is responsible for handling the dialing and listening\n through a relay, and the `Relay` behaviour is responsible for managing the relay connections.\n\n\n```rust\nuse lib\np2p::core::transport::Transport;\nuse libp2p::core::upgrade;\nuse libp\n2p::noise;\nuse libp2p::tcp::async_io::Transport as TcpTransport;\nuse\n libp2p_relay::{new_transport_and_behaviour, Relay, RelayConfig};\nuse libp2p::\nidentity;\n\n// Create a random keypair for the local peer\nlet local_key = identity::Keypair::\ngenerate_ed25519();\nlet local_peer_id = local_key.public().to_peer_\nid();\n\n// Create a TCP transport.\nlet tcp_transport = TcpTransport::new(libp2p::tcp\n::Config::default());\n\n// Create a noise transport.\nlet noise_keys = noise::Config::new(&\nlocal_key).unwrap();\nlet transport = tcp_transport\n    .upgrade(upgrade::Version::V1Lazy\n)\n    .authenticate(noise_keys)\n    .multiplex(libp2p::yamux::Config\n::default())\n    .boxed();\n\n// Create a relay transport and behaviour.\nlet (relay_transport,\n relay_behaviour) = new_transport_and_behaviour(\n    RelayConfig::default(),\n    transport,\n\n);\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Create a `Swarm`\n\nYou need to create a `Swarm` that\n uses the `relay_transport` and combines your application's `NetworkBehaviour` with the `relay_behaviour`.\n\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::swarm::{Swarm, SwarmBuilder};\nuse libp2p::core\n::peer_id::PeerId;\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\n#[derive(libp2p::swarm\n::NetworkBehaviour)]\n#[behaviour(to_swarm = \"MyEvent\")]\nstruct MyBehaviour {\n    relay\n: Relay,\n    // ... your other behaviours\n}\n\nenum MyEvent {\n    Relay(libp2p_\nrelay::Event),\n    // ... your other events\n}\n\nimpl From<libp2p_relay::Event> for\n MyEvent {\n    fn from(event: libp2p_relay::Event) -> Self {\n        MyEvent::\nRelay(event)\n    }\n}\n\n\nlet mut swarm = {\n    let behaviour = MyBehaviour {\n\n        relay: relay_behaviour,\n        // ... your other behaviours\n    };\n    SwarmBuilder::\nwith_executor(\n        relay_transport,\n        behaviour,\n        local_peer_id,\n        Box\n::new(|fut| { tokio::spawn(fut); }),\n    ).build()\n};\n\n```\n\n\n### 4\n. Dial a relayed address\n\nTo dial a peer through a relay, you need to construct a multiaddress in the following\n format:\n\n`/ip4/<relay-ip>/tcp/<relay-port>/p2p/<relay-id>/p\n2p-circuit/p2p/<remote-id>`\n\nHere's how you can dial a relayed address:\n\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::Multiaddr;\nuse std::str::FromStr;\n\nlet relay_address\n = Multiaddr::from_str(\"/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4\n001/p2p/QmRelay\").unwrap();\nlet remote_peer_id = \"Qm\nRemote\";\nlet remote_address = relay_address\n    .with(libp2p::multiaddr::Protocol::\nP2pCircuit)\n    .with(libp2p::multiaddr::Protocol::P2p(remote_\npeer_id.parse().unwrap()));\n\nswarm.dial(remote_address).unwrap();\n\n```\n\n\nThis will\n instruct the `Swarm` to connect to the relay at `/ip4/127.0.0.1\n/tcp/4001/p2p/QmRelay`, and then ask the relay to establish a relayed\n connection to the remote peer with the ID `QmRemote`.\n\nThis is the current and recommended way to use the `rust-libp\n2p` relay client as of early 2026.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685967947-8216f7c6344da","status":"completed","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"glob","status":"pending","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"glob-1769685976113-5c97073f122208","status":"completed","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"glob-1769685976137-48f2e32ce6f9","status":"completed","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"read_file","status":"pending","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"read_file-1769685984925-9b5a131e7ffa58","status":"completed","timestamp":45266},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685989329-d5972a0c7f6798","status":"completed","timestamp":45266},{"type":"message","content":"To use the `rust-libp","timestamp":45266},{"type":"message","content":"2p` relay client to dial through a relay, you need to use the `libp2p-relay` crate.","timestamp":45266},{"type":"message","content":" This crate provides a `RelayTransport` that wraps your existing transport and enables it to dial through relay servers.\n\nHere is","timestamp":45266},{"type":"message","content":" a conceptual example of how to use the relay client:\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1859","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\n2026年如何通过锁定效应 lock-in effect 和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\n2026年如何通过锁定效应 lock-in effect 和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？\n好的，我们来探讨一下在2026年，企业\n如何利用“锁定效应”（Lock-in Effect）和“路径依赖”（Path Dependence）这两个强大的经济学概念，\n来构建难以被竞争对手模仿的护城河。\n\n### **核心理念**\n\n*   **锁定效应\n (Lock-in Effect)**：让用户在选择了你的产品或服务后，因为转换成本过高（无论是\n金钱、时间、精力还是情感上的投入），而难以转向竞争对手的产品。\n*   **路径依赖 (Path\n Dependence)**：指一旦做出某种选择，就像进入了一条不归路，惯性的力量会使这一选择不断\n自我强化，让你未来的决策不得不在既有的道路上持续走下去。\n\n结合这两点，企业的目标就是\n让客户“锁定”在自己预设的“路径”上，从而建立起强大的竞争壁垒。\n\n### **一\n、 强化“锁定效应”的策略**\n\n#### 1. **构建生态系统锁定**\n\n*   **\n平台化战略**：不要只卖单个产品，而是要构建一个由硬件、软件和服务组成的生态系统。\n苹果是这方面的典范，通过App Store、iCloud、以及Watch、iPhone、Mac之间的无缝协作\n，用户一旦进入其生态，就很难离开。\n*   **AI驱动的个性化服务**：到\n2026年，AI将成为基础设施。利用AI深度学习用户的行为和偏好，提供高度定制\n化的服务。例如，一个AI购物助手，如果它比用户自己更懂其需求，能够自动化地完成购物\n决策，那么用户将极度依赖这个助手，转换成本极高。\n*   **数据壁垒**：在高\n价值、高复杂度的垂直领域（如金融、医疗），通过积累海量的专有数据和知识产权，形成\n数据和技术上的双重锁定。\n\n#### 2. **创造高昂的转换成本**\n\n*   **技术集成\n与兼容性**：让你的产品或服务成为用户工作流程或生活中不可或缺的一环。例如，\n在软件开发领域，一旦团队习惯了某个CI/CD（持续集成/持续部署）工具链，并投入\n大量时间进行配置和集成，更换的成本将是巨大的。\n*   **提升学习成本**：如果你的产品功能\n强大但需要一定的学习曲线，一旦用户投入时间掌握，他们就不愿意再去学习新的替代品。\n*\n   **供应链与数据链的深度绑定**：在B2B领域，与上下游企业建立稳定的合作关系\n，形成数据和供应链的深度绑定，共同应对市场挑战，这种合作关系本身就是一种锁定。\n\n#### 3\n. **品牌与情感锁定**\n\n*   **建立价值观认同**：强大的品牌能超越功能，与\n用户建立情感连接。用户购买的不仅是产品，更是一种身份认同或对未来科技的信仰，\n例如特斯拉的粉丝文化。\n*   **极致的用户体验**：从产品设计到客户服务的每一个细节，都\n提供一致且卓越的体验，这种信任感和熟悉感是用户留下来的重要原因。\n\n### **二、 利用\n“路径依赖”的策略**\n\n#### 1. **抢占先机，制定标准**\n\n*   \n**定义新兴市场**：在AI、Web3等新兴领域，率先进入市场并定义行业标准，让\n后来者只能成为追随者。一旦技术路径被确立，后来者要颠覆的难度将大大增加。\n\n*   **持续的研发投入**：技术上的领先优势是形成路径依赖的基础。通过持续的研发投入，不断巩\n固技术壁垒，让竞争对手难以望其项背。例如，芯片行业的竞争，就需要在一个细分品\n类上做到极致，形成“品类认知+场景绑定+生态壁垒”。\n\n#### 2. **沉\n淀组织能力与文化**\n\n*   **独特的管理体系**：像丰田的“精益生产”模式\n，是其数十年管理实践和文化沉淀的结果，竞争对手可以学习其理论，但难以复制其精\n髓。这种独特的组织能力是难以模仿的。\n*   **知识资本的积累**：通过系统性\n的人才培养和知识管理，形成企业独特的知识库和人才梯队，这是企业持续创新的核心动力\n。\n\n#### 3. ** leveraging 网络效应与规模效应**\n\n*   **引爆网络效应**：在\n平台型业务中，越多的用户意味着越高的价值，从而吸引更多的用户加入，形成正向循环。一旦\n形成网络效应，后来者很难与之抗衡。\n*   **实现规模经济**：通过扩大生产或\n运营规模，显著降低单位成本，形成价格优势，挤压竞争对手的生存空间。\n\n### **2\n026年的特别关注点**\n\n*

{"id":"websearch-1891","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025?\nBased on the search results from late 202\n5 and early 2026, there isn't a single official document titled \"Breaking Changes for LiveKit Agents v1\n.2 MCP\". However, several GitHub issues reported by users highlight significant regressions and behavioral changes that can be considered breaking.\n\n\nHere are the key issues and how to address them:\n\n### 1. Agent Fails to Respond After MCP Tool Execution\n\n\n*   **Issue:** A regression was introduced in `livekit-agents v1.2.7` where the\n agent stops responding after an MCP tool is used. This is documented in [GitHub Issue #3295](https://\ngithub.com/livekit/agents/issues/3295). The agent doesn't crash, but it\n fails to speak after the tool's execution.\n\n*   **How to Fix:**\n    *   **Option\n 1 (Downgrade):** The issue states that this behavior is not present in version `1.2.6`.\n If this functionality is critical, you can downgrade your `livekit-agents` package to `1.2.6`.\n\n    *   **Option 2 (Upgrade):** As this is a regression, it's likely fixed in a subsequent patch\n release. The recommended approach is to upgrade to the latest version of the `v1.2.x` line or a\n newer stable version (e.g., `v1.3.x` or higher) where this bug has been addressed\n.\n\n### 2. Deprecation of SSE for MCP Connections\n\n*   **Issue:** [GitHub Issue #23\n92](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/2392) points out that the\n Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol is deprecated for MCP and that there is a need for a `StreamableHTTP\n` client to communicate with third-party tools.\n\n*   **How to Fix:**\n    *   This is an\n architectural shift. You will need to update your code to use the new `StreamableHTTP` class for your MCP integrations\n instead of relying on SSE.\n    *   Check the official LiveKit agents documentation or examples for the correct way to implement\n the `StreamableHTTP` client for communication with your tools.\n\n### 3. General Instability and Other Issues\n\nSeveral\n other issues point to instability and unexpected behavior in the `v1.2` timeframe:\n\n*   **Tool Integration\n Problems:** Issues like [#4397](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/43\n97) show that specific tools (like Gemini FileSearch) may not work correctly with the MCP implementation.\n*   **Inter\nruption Bugs:** Issues like [#3515](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/35\n15) and [#4047](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/4\n047) indicate problems with the agent's interruption handling, where it might speak over the user or ignore interruption\n duration settings.\n*   **Connection Errors:** As seen in [#4252](https://github.com/livekit\n/agents/issues/4252), users have reported connection issues with self-hosted agents.\n\n*   **How to\n Fix These Issues:**\n    *   **Check for Version Alignment:** Many issues arise from mismatched versions of `livekit\n`, `livekit-agents`, `livekit-api`, and the various plugins. Ensure that all your LiveKit-\nrelated packages are on compatible versions. The `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` files in the GitHub\n issues are a good reference for compatible dependency sets.\n    *   **Upgrade to the Latest Patch:** The most reliable way to\n fix bugs is to upgrade to the latest patch release of your current minor version or to the next stable minor version.\n    \n*   **Consult GitHub Issues:** For specific problems, the GitHub issues are a valuable resource. Search for your issue and\n you may find workarounds or solutions provided by the LiveKit team or the community.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations:\n\n1.  \n**If you are on `v1.2.7` and experiencing agents going silent after MCP tool use, either\n downgrade to `v1.2.6` or upgrade to a newer version.**\n2.  **Migrate from\n the deprecated SSE protocol to the `StreamableHTTP` client for third-party tool integrations.**\n3.  **Ensure all\n `livekit-*` packages are on compatible versions.**\n4.  **Keep your `livekit-agents` library\n updated to the latest stable release to benefit from bug fixes.**","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025?","timestamp":34863},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":34863},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":34863},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686437403-eb25ea0d72d9c","status":"completed","timestamp":34863},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686437422-23d11a7b9a8f1","status":"completed","timestamp":34863},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results from late 202","timestamp":34863},{"type":"message","content":"5 and early 2026, there isn't a single official document titled \"Breaking Changes for LiveKit Agents v1","timestamp":34863},{"type":"message","content":".2 MCP\".

{"id":"websearch-1909","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026\nHere\n is a guide on how to set up the Happ proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port\n for use in an antidetect browser. This guide is based on the underlying Xray-core technology that Happ uses.\n\n###\n Understanding the Setup\n\nThe Happ application is a user-friendly client for the powerful Xray-core proxy engine. To\n achieve the desired setup, you need to configure the Xray-core within the Happ application to:\n\n1.  \n**Create a SOCKS5 proxy server.**\n2.  **Allow other devices on your local network (LAN)\n to connect to it.**\n\n### Configuration Steps\n\nThe exact steps to configure Happ may vary depending on the version and operating\n system you are using. However, the general principle is to define an \"inbound\" connection in the Xray-core configuration\n. Here is a sample JSON configuration that you can adapt and use:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inbounds\n\": [\n    {\n      \"port\": 1080,\n      \"listen\": \"0.\n0.0.0\",\n      \"protocol\": \"socks\",\n      \"settings\": {\n        \"auth\": \"\nnoauth\",\n        \"udp\": true\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"outbounds\": [\n\n    {\n      \"protocol\": \"freedom\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Explanation of\n the Configuration\n\n*   `\"port\": 1080`: This is the port your SOCKS5 proxy\n will listen on. You can change this to any available port.\n*   `\"listen\": \"0.0\n.0.0\"`: This is the crucial setting that allows connections from your LAN. It tells the proxy to listen on all available\n network interfaces, not just the local machine.\n*   `\"protocol\": \"socks\"`: This specifies that you\n are creating a SOCKS proxy.\n*   `\"auth\": \"noauth\"`: This setting means that no authentication is\n required to use the proxy. For a more secure setup, you can configure username and password authentication.\n*   `\"udp\":\n true`: This enables UDP support, which is recommended for a better browsing experience.\n*   `\"outbounds\"\n`: This section defines how the proxy will connect to the internet. The `\"freedom\"` protocol means it will connect directly.\n\n\n### Applying the Configuration in Happ\n\n1.  **Open the Happ application.**\n2.  **Look for a\n section to add or edit server configurations.** This might be labeled as \"Profiles,\" \"Configurations,\" or \"Settings.\"\n3.\n  **Find an option to add a custom configuration.** You might be able to import a JSON file or paste the configuration directly into\n a text box.\n4.  **Paste the JSON configuration above into the appropriate field.**\n5.  **Save\n the configuration and activate the new profile.**\n\n### Finding Your LAN IP Address\n\nTo connect to the proxy from another device on your\n network, you will need the LAN IP address of the computer running the Happ proxy.\n\n*   **Windows:** Open\n Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`. Look for the \"IPv4 Address\" under your active network adapter.\n*   **\nmacOS:** Open System Preferences > Network. Your IP address will be displayed.\n*   **Linux:** Open a\n terminal and type `hostname -I` or `ip addr`.\n\n### Configuring Your Antidetect Browser\n\n1.  **Open\n the proxy settings in your antidetect browser.**\n2.  **Select SOCKS5 as the proxy type.**\n\n3.  **Enter the LAN IP address of the computer running Happ as the proxy server address.**\n4.  **Enter the\n port you specified in the configuration (e.g., 1080).**\n5.  **Leave\n the username and password fields blank if you used `\"auth\": \"noauth\"`**\n6.  **Save the settings\n and test the connection.**\n\n**Disclaimer:** The exact user interface and configuration method in the Happ application may differ. If\n you cannot find a way to use a custom JSON configuration, look for settings that correspond to the options in the JSON file\n, such as \"Listen Address,\" \"Port,\" \"Protocol,\" and \"Authentication.\"","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686484934-fded0c031f971","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686493451-b7ff5fb1e8fb6","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-contents-1769686498960-21690ed6f6f08","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"read_file","status":"pending","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"read_file-1769686509347-1808b71d3d5a7","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"read_file-1769686509367-e98079a1c3b9b8","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686514657-e09b9822265cc","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686514674-880fe902281868","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-contents-1769686519700-733f0837569af8","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686528779-bae95083b3986","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686528799-77facb7c59ee18","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686528824-2dc745c1a9715","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686537548-0bb1eea3189a1","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686537566-5175e6ee06bd68","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686537590-1c93448caec368","status":"completed","timestamp":75514},{"type":"message","content":"Here","timestamp":75514},{"type":"message","content":" is a guide on how to set up the Happ proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port","timestamp":75514},{"type":"message","content":" for use in an antidetect browser.

Here are the latest best practices:\n\n*   **Embrace ELT (\nExtract, Load, Transform):** The traditional ETL process is often being replaced by the ELT paradigm. In ELT\n, data is first loaded into a data warehouse or data lake and then transformed. This approach offers greater flexibility, preserves raw\n data for future use, and allows various teams to access and work with the data sooner.\n\n*   **Leverage Cloud-Native\n and Managed Services:** Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP offer powerful, scalable, and cost-effective ETL/\nELT services (e.g., AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory). These services automate many of the manual tasks associated\n with pipeline management, allowing teams to focus on data transformation logic.\n\n*   **Automate Everything with Modern Orchestration Tools\n:** Tools like Apache Airflow, Dagster, and Prefect are essential for orchestrating, scheduling, and monitoring complex\n data workflows. They provide features like dependency management, automatic retries, and alerting, which are critical for maintaining reliable data\n pipelines.\n\n*   **Prioritize Data Quality and Governance:**\n    *   **Data Contracts:** Implement data contracts\n to ensure that data producers and consumers have a clear and agreed-upon understanding of data schemas and semantics.\n    *\n   **Data Quality Frameworks:** Use tools like Great Expectations to define, validate, and document data quality rules directly within your pipelines\n.\n    *   **Data Masking and Security:** For compliance and security, especially with sensitive data, employ data masking techniques\n to protect data while still allowing it to be used for development and testing.\n\n*   **Implement CI/CD for Data\n Pipelines (DataOps):** Apply the principles of DevOps to data pipelines. This includes version control for your pipeline code, automated\n testing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate the deployment of pipeline changes. This practice improves reliability\n and reduces manual errors.\n\n*   **Design for Scalability and Performance:**\n    *   **Incremental Data Processing\n:** Instead of processing full datasets in every run, design pipelines to handle incremental data loads. This is more efficient and reduces\n processing time.\n    *   **Use Staging Tables:** Utilize staging tables in your data warehouse to land raw data before transformation\n. This can simplify debugging and improve performance.\n    *   **Avoid Row-by-Row Operations:** Perform set\n-based operations whenever possible, as they are significantly more performant than row-by-row processing.\n\n*   **\nIntegrate Real-Time and Streaming Data:** As businesses demand more up-to-date data, the ability to process\n streaming data in real-time is crucial. Tools like Apache Kafka and streaming services from cloud providers are key for building streaming\n ETL pipelines.\n\n*   **Focus on Metadata Management:** Maintain a centralized metadata repository. This is vital for data discovery\n, data lineage, and understanding the impact of changes to your data pipelines.

As we look towards 2026, the landscape of Infrastructure\n as Code (IaC) security is evolving, with a clear trend towards integrated, developer-centric tools and automated governance\n.\n\nA significant development in this space is the integration of **tfsec into Trivy**, a comprehensive security scanner by Aqua\n Security. While tfsec's core functionality and syntax for ignoring rules are still relevant, the future of Terraform security scanning with\n this toolset lies within Trivy.\n\nThis guide will provide a forward-looking approach to managing baseline exceptions for tfsec,\n checkov, and Trivy, incorporating best practices and strategies that will be crucial in 2026 and beyond.\n\n###\n **Methods for Managing Exceptions**\n\nThere are several ways to manage exceptions, each with its own advantages and use cases.\n\n\n#### **1. In-line Comments**\n\nThe most direct way to handle a specific exception is to add a comment\n directly to the line of code that's causing the violation. This is useful for one-off exceptions where a specific\n resource needs to deviate from a policy for a legitimate reason.\n\n**tfsec/Trivy:**\n\nTo ignore a specific rule\n in `tfsec` or `Trivy`, add a comment in the format `#trivy:ignore:<\nRULE_ID>` or `#tfsec:ignore:<RULE_ID>` to the offending line. You can also add\n a comment on the line above the block.\n\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"my-\nrule\" {\n  type        = \"ingress\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\n\"] #trivy:ignore:AVD-AWS-0107\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Checkov\n:**\n\n`Checkov` uses a similar approach with the format `checkov:skip=<CHECK_ID>:<\njustification>`. Including a justification is a recommended best practice.\n\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\"\n \"my_bucket\" {\n  bucket = \"my-unique-bucket-name\"\n  acl    = \"public-\nread\" #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:This bucket is for public website assets\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n#### **2. Configuration Files**\n\nFor managing exceptions across an entire project or for disabling certain checks\n globally, configuration files are a more scalable solution.\n\n**tfsec/Trivy:**\n\n`Trivy` (and\n `tfsec`) can be configured with a `.trivy.yaml` or `tfsec.yml` file in\n the root of your project to exclude certain rules.\n\n\n```yaml\n# .trivy.yaml\nmisconfigurations:\n  \n- id: AVD-AWS-0107\n    severity: 'CRITICAL'\n    ignore: true\n\n```\n\n\n**Checkov:**\n\n`Checkov` can be configured with a `.checkov.yml` file to skip\n checks.\n\n\n```yaml\n# .checkov.yml\nskip-check:\n  - CKV_AWS_20\n\n\n```\n\n\n#### **3. Policy-as-Code (PaC)**\n\nFor more granular and programmatic control over\n exceptions, especially in large and complex environments, Policy-as-Code (PaC) frameworks like **Open Policy Agent (OPA\n)** are becoming the standard. Tools like `checkov` and `Trivy` can be integrated with OPA to\n enforce custom policies and manage exceptions with greater flexibility. This approach allows you to define exceptions based on context, such as the environment\n, application, or resource tags.\n\n### **Best Practices for Managing Baselines in Production (Looking Towards 202\n6)**\n\nAs we move towards 2026, managing a baseline of security exceptions will require a more sophisticated\n and automated approach.\n\n#### **1. Establish a Formal Exception Management Process**\n\n*   **Justification and Approval:** Every exception\n must have a clear and documented justification, and it must be approved by the security team or a designated authority.\n*   **Time\n-boxing:** Exceptions should not be permanent. Each exception should have an expiration date, after which it must be reviewed and either\n re-approved or remediated.\n*   **Auditable Trail:** All exception requests, approvals, and reviews must\n be logged in a system of record for auditing purposes.\n\n#### **2. The Principle of Least Privilege for Exceptions**\n\nExceptions\n should be as specific as possible. Avoid broad exceptions that could inadvertently mask other security risks. For example, instead of disabling\n a check for all S3 buckets, ignore it only for the specific bucket that requires a public ACL.\n\n#### **\n3. Regularly Review and Audit Exceptions**\n\nSchedule regular reviews of all active exceptions. This can be done quarterly or semi\n-annually. The goal is to reduce the number of exceptions over time by finding ways to remediate the underlying issues\n.\n\n#### **4. Integrate with CI/CD**\n\nIntegrate your security scanning tools into your CI/CD\n pipeline to catch violations early. Your pipeline should:\n\n*   **Fail the build** if new, unapproved violations\n are detected.\n*   **Allow the build to pass** if only pre-approved baseline exceptions are present.\n*   **\nGenerate a report** of all findings, including both new violations and existing exceptions.\n\n#### **5. Break Glass Procedures**\n\n\nIn emergency situations, you may need to bypass security controls. A \"break glass\" procedure allows for this in a controlled and audited\n manner. This typically involves:\n\n*   **A specific IAM role** with elevated privileges that can be assumed in an emergency.\n\n*   **Automated alerting** to the security team whenever the break glass role is used.\n*   **A clear\n process** for documenting the reason for using the break glass procedure and for revoking the elevated privileges as soon as the emergency\n is over.\n\n#### **6. Automated Tooling and Dashboards**\n\nUse tools to automate the tracking and management of your\n exception baseline. A dashboard that visualizes the current state of your exceptions, their expiration dates, and their owners can be\n invaluable for maintaining visibility and accountability.\n\n### **The Future of IaC Security (2026 and Beyond)**\n\nThe\n future of IaC security will be shaped by several key trends:\n\n*   **Shift-Left and Developer Enablement:**\n Security will become even more integrated into the development process. Developers will be empowered with tools and processes to manage security exceptions themselves\n, with the security team acting as advisors and setting the overall policy.\n*   **AI and Machine Learning:** AI\n and ML will play an increasingly important role in automating exception management. For example, AI could be used to analyze the context of a violation\n and suggest an appropriate exception, or to identify exceptions that are no longer needed.\n*   **Unified Security Platforms:** The\n trend of consolidating security tools into unified platforms will continue. Tools like `Trivy`, which can scan for vulnerabilities, mis\nconfigurations, and secrets in a single pass, will become the norm. This will provide a more holistic view of risk and simplify\n the management of security exceptions.\n\nBy adopting these forward-looking strategies and best practices, you can effectively manage your Terraform\n security scanning baseline exceptions in production, ensuring a strong security posture while enabling the speed and agility of modern DevOps.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686701031-ab86ab24580e5","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686707534-c9eb5ff57f586","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686707550-4c78b05c2aeb1","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686707569-9666be27ea26a8","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686707590-d33c861245ca8","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686707616-f456d762199b98","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686707643-66c00e835498f","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686724720-8f767c3bc1d91","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686739362-7af4792684fec8","status":"completed","timestamp":77183},{"type":"message","content":"Managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production is a critical practice","timestamp":77183},{"type":"message","content":" for maintaining a strong security posture while ensuring operational efficiency.

The design will focus on reassuring the user that their complex booking is correct and providing them with all the necessary information at\n a glance.\n\nHere are the top UI patterns for a multi-room hotel booking confirmation page in 202\n6:\n\n### 1. **Master Confirmation Summary**\n\nAt the very top of the page, a clear and\n concise summary of the entire booking should be displayed. This \"master\" confirmation should include:\n\n*   **A single, prominent\n confirmation number** for the entire multi-room booking.\n*   **The hotel's name and address.**\n*   \n**The total cost** of the booking.\n*   **The check-in and check-out dates.**\n\n### 2\n. **Accordion or Tabbed Room Details**\n\nTo avoid overwhelming the user with information, the details for each room should be organized\n in a collapsible accordion or a tabbed interface. This allows the user to view the details of each room one at a time.\n Each room's section should include:\n\n*   **A unique confirmation number** for that specific room.\n*   **The\n room type** (e.g., \"King Bed, Ocean View\").\n*   **The guest's name** assigned\n to that room.\n*   **A clear breakdown of the cost** for that room, including taxes and fees.\n\n*   **A list of the amenities** included with the room.\n*   **High-quality images or a virtual\n tour** of the room.\n\n### 3. **Interactive Itinerary View**\n\nA visual, timeline-based itinerary of\n the stay can be a very effective way to present the information. This could include:\n\n*   **A day-by-day\n breakdown** of the stay, with the check-in and check-out dates clearly marked.\n*   **The\n ability to add notes or reminders** for each day of the trip.\n*   **Integration with the user's calendar\n** (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar).\n\n### 4. **Post-Booking Actions and Self\n-Service**\n\nThe confirmation page should empower the user to manage their booking without having to call customer service.
