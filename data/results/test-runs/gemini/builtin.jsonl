Create a Vue 3 Project\n\nIf you don't have a project, create a new Vue \n3 project using Vite:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm create vue@latest\n```\n\n\nFollow the prompts, making sure to select Vue\n 3.\n\n### 2. Install Dependencies\n\nNavigate to your project's directory and install Element Plus, and\n the necessary plugins for cron jobs and auto-importing components:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install element-plus @vue-\njs-cron/element-plus unplugin-vue-components unplugin-auto-import\n\n```\n\n\n### \n3. Configure Vite\n\nModify your `vite.config.ts` file to use `unplugin-vue-components` and \n`unplugin-auto-import` for on-demand component and style importing. This will improve your application's performance by\n only loading the components you use.\n\n\n```typescript\n// vite.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite\n'\nimport vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'\nimport AutoImport from 'unplugin-auto-\nimport/vite'\nimport Components from 'unplugin-vue-components/vite'\nimport { ElementPlusResolver\n } from 'unplugin-vue-components/resolvers'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    vue(),\n\n    AutoImport({\n      resolvers: [ElementPlusResolver()],\n    }),\n    Components({\n      resolvers\n: [ElementPlusResolver()],\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Configure `tsconfig\n.json` (for TypeScript)\n\nIf you are using TypeScript, you need to add the Element Plus types to your\n `tsconfig.json` file for proper type checking and autocompletion in your editor.\n\n\n```json\n// ts\nconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    // ... other options\n    \"types\": [\"\nelement-plus/global\"]\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 5. Update `main.ts`\n\nImport the\n main Element Plus stylesheet in your `src/main.ts` file:\n\n\n```typescript\n// src/main.ts\n\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\nimport App from './App.vue'\nimport 'element-plus/dist\n/index.css'\n\nconst app = createApp(App)\n\napp.mount('#app')\n\n```\n\n\n### 6\n. Use the Cron Editor Component\n\nYou can now use the `CronEditor` component from `@vue-js-cron/element\n-plus` in your Vue components. Here is an example of how to use it in a component:\n\n\n```vue\n\n<!-- src/components/CronJobScheduler.vue -->\n<template>\n  <el-card>\n    <\ntemplate #header>\n      <div class=\"card-header\">\n        <span>Cron Job Scheduler</span>\n      </div>\n    </\ntemplate>\n    <cron-editor v-model:cron=\"cronExpression\" />\n    <p style=\"margin-top\n: 1em;\">The current cron expression is: <strong>{{ cronExpression }}</strong></p>\n  </\nel-card>\n</template>\n\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue\n'\nimport { CronEditor } from '@vue-js-cron/element-plus'\n\nconst cronExpression = ref('*\n * * * *')\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n.card-header {\n  display:\n flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n</\nstyle>\n\n```\n\n\nNow you can use the `CronJobScheduler` component in your `App.vue` or any other component\n.\n\nThis setup will give you a working cron job editor in your Vue 3 application with the Element Plus UI library\n. The use of auto-importing plugins will keep your application's bundle size optimized.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to use vite-plugin-vue-cron with Vue 3 and Element Plus in 2026","timestamp":31176},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":31176},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769680147712-951c405932296","status":"completed","timestamp":31176},{"type":"message","content":"Here is a guide on how","timestamp":31176},{"type":"message","content":" to use `vite-plugin-vue-cron` with Vue 3 and Element Plus in 2026.","timestamp":31176},{"type":"message","content":"\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1804","input":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","output":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024\nTo\n set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS, you'll primarily modify your `tailwind.config.js` file to extend the default color palette.\n\nHere's how:\n\n1.  **Loc\nate (or create) `tailwind.config.js`:** This file is usually at the root of your project. If it doesn't exist, you can generate it using `npx tailwindcss init`.\n\n2.  \n**Extend the `theme.extend.colors` section:** Inside `tailwind.config.js`, you'll find a `theme` object. Within that, there's usually an `extend` object, and within `extend`, a\n `colors` object. This is where you define your custom colors.\n\n    \n```javascript\n    // tailwind.config.js\n    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\n    module.exports = {\n      content:\n [\n        \"./index.html\",\n        \"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n      ],\n      theme: {\n        extend: {\n          colors: {\n            // Define your custom colors here\n            '\nprimary': {\n              DEFAULT: '#3490dc', // A default shade for 'primary'\n              '50': '#eff6ff',\n              '100': '#dbeafe',\n              '\n200': '#bfdbfe',\n              '300': '#93c5fd',\n              '400': '#60a5fa',\n              '500': '#3b82f\n6',\n              '600': '#2563eb',\n              '700': '#1d4ed8',\n              '800': '#1e40af',\n              '900':\n '#1e3a8a',\n            },\n            'secondary': '#6574cd',\n            'accent': '#f6ad55',\n            'dark-blue': '#0a192\nf',\n            'light-blue': '#ccd6f6',\n            'green-accent': '#64ffda',\n            // ... more custom colors\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      plugins:\n [],\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Using your custom colors:** Once defined, you can use these colors in your HTML and CSS just like Tailwind's default colors. Tailwind's mobile-first approach means that any\n utility class without a breakpoint prefix applies to all screen sizes (mobile first), and you can then override for larger screens.\n\n    \n```html\n    <div class=\"bg-primary-700 text-light-blue md:bg\n-secondary lg:text-green-accent\">\n      <p>This text is light-blue on mobile, and green-accent on large screens.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <button class=\"bg-accent hover:bg-accent\n-600 text-dark-blue font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">\n      My Custom Button\n    </button>\n    \n```\n\n\n**Explanation for Mobile-First Responsive Design:**\n\nTailwind CSS is\n inherently mobile-first. This means:\n\n*   **Default Styles (Mobile):** Any utility class you apply (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-light-blue`) without a breakpoint prefix (`sm:`, `md:\n`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`) will apply to all screen sizes, effectively setting the mobile styles as the default.\n*   **Breakpoint Overrides:** To change styles for larger screens, you prefix your utility classes with\n the desired breakpoint. For example:\n    *   `md:bg-secondary` will override `bg-primary` *from* the medium breakpoint (`md`) and up.\n    *   `lg:text-green-accent` will\n override `text-light-blue` *from* the large breakpoint (`lg`) and up.\n\nBy defining your custom colors in `tailwind.config.js`, you integrate them seamlessly into this mobile-first workflow.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","timestamp":10470},{"type":"message","content":"To","timestamp":10470},{"type":"message","content":" set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS, you'll primarily modify your `tailwind.config.js` file to extend the default color palette.\n\nHere's how:\n\n1.  **Loc","timestamp":10470},{"type":"message","content":"ate (or create) `tailwind.config.js`:** This file is usually at the root of your project.

{"id":"websearch-88","input":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","output":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?\nIn\n 2026, LangGraph has solidified its position as a leading framework for\n developing sophisticated, stateful AI agents. Here's a breakdown of how to handle memory state management and RAG context\n injection within this paradigm:\n\n### LangGraph Memory State Management\n\nLangGraph provides a structured approach to memory, dividing it into two main\n categories:\n\n1.  **Short-Term Memory (Agent State):** This is the most common type of memory you\n'll manage. It represents the agent's current understanding of the world and is handled directly within the graph's state.\n\n    *   **Persistence:** A key feature of LangGraph is its use of \"checkpointers\" to automatically save the\n agent's state to a database (like PostgreSQL or Redis). This allows for long-running, multi-turn conversations\n, as well as more advanced features like human-in-the-loop interventions and debugging.\n    *   **\nStructure:** The state is typically defined using `TypedDict` or Pydantic models. This ensures a clear and predictable structure\n for the data flowing through your agent.\n    *   **Updates:** State updates are handled by \"reducer\" functions,\n which deterministically merge new information into the existing state. This is especially important when dealing with concurrent operations.\n\n2.\n  **Long-Term Memory:** This type of memory is used for storing information that needs to persist across multiple conversations or\n sessions, such as user preferences or application-level data. It's typically stored as JSON documents and can be accessed at\n any time.\n\n### RAG Context Injection\n\nLangGraph excels at building \"agentic RAG\" systems, which are a\n significant step up from traditional RAG pipelines. Here's how it works:\n\n*   **Dynamic Context Injection:** Instead of\n a fixed \"retrieve-then-generate\" process, LangGraph agents can dynamically decide when and how to retrieve information from external knowledge\n bases. This allows for more targeted and efficient use of your data.\n*   **Agentic RAG Implementation:**\n Building a RAG agent in LangGraph typically involves these steps:\n    1.  **Document Preprocessing:** Preparing\n your documents for retrieval.\n    2.  **Indexing and Retriever Tools:** Indexing your documents for semantic search and creating\n tools that the agent can use to retrieve information.\n    3.  **Decision-Making:** The agent is designed to make\n intelligent decisions about when to use these retriever tools based on the current conversation.\n    4.  **Context Engineering:** Lang\nGraph supports various strategies for ensuring that the most relevant information is provided to the LLM at each step.\n\n### Best\n Practices for 2026\n\nAs of 2026, the following are considered best practices for building\n production-grade LangGraph applications:\n\n*   Use strictly typed state to ensure data integrity.\n*   Design small\n, focused nodes with single responsibilities.\n*   Implement explicit routing logic to control the flow of your agent.\n*\n   Incorporate retry caps, timeouts, and guardrails to prevent errors.\n*   Use checkpoints for persistence and recovery\n.\n*   Prioritize observability for debugging and monitoring.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","timestamp":31640},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":31640},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769680228771-d85ccb29a22448","status":"completed","timestamp":31640},{"type":"message","content":"In","timestamp":31640},{"type":"message","content":" 2026, LangGraph has solidified its position as a leading framework for","timestamp":31640},{"type":"message","content":" developing sophisticated, stateful AI agents.
