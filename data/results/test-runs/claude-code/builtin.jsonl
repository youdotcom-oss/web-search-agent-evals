Training proceeds through multiple epochs using dynamic sampling within difficulty levels based on effectiveness scoring.\n\n**DAPO (Dynamic Advantage-Weighted Policy Optimization)**: Introduces Dynamic Sampling that filters out zero-variance prompts and refills training batches with effective data through resampling, improving upon GRPO.\n\n**Online Data Generation**: RL enables models to generate data online during each training iteration (rollout), allowing iterative refinement of reasoning strategies through self-exploration. Scaling computational resources to sample more responses allows models to selectively utilize higher-quality data.\n\n## Curriculum Learning Approaches\n\n**E2H Reasoner (Easy-to-Hard)**: Schedules tasks from easy to hard, allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Shows significant improvements for small LLMs (1.5B-3B parameters) that struggle with vanilla RL.\n\n**CuMa (Curriculum-guided Masked Majority Voting)**: Uses curriculum learning to progressively introduce harder problems and masks no-majority rollouts during training. Includes a data curation pipeline generating samples with predefined difficulty levels (1-5).\n\n**Self-Evolving Curriculum**: Adaptively curates data to concentrate computational resources on more challenging or less frequently solved problems, optimizing the learning process.\n\n## RLHF Data Selection Innovations\n\n**RLTHF (Targeted Human Feedback)**: Combines LLM-based initial alignment with selective human corrections, identifying hard-to-annotate samples using reward model distributions. Achieves full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7% of the human annotation effort.\n\n**Data-Centric RLHF Metrics**: Studies preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content, proposing specific metrics for each axis of comparison.\n\n**Online Iterative RLHF**: Continuous feedback collection and model updates enable dynamic adaptation to evolving preferences.\n\n## Reinforcement Learning Paradigms\n\n**RLVR (RL with Verifiable Rewards)**: Using algorithms like GRPO has emerged as a key approach for developing reasoning models. The DeepSeek R1 release (January 2025) demonstrated that reasoning-like behavior can be developed with RL, influencing subsequent work.\n\n**Automated Dataset Construction**: LLMs with enhanced reasoning skills generate large-scale, high-quality reasoning trajectories for training other models (e.g., Qwen2.5 models fine-tuned on DeepSeek-R1-labeled data).\n\n## Key Trends\n\n- Shift from static to dynamic data selection during training\n- Integration of curriculum learning with difficulty-aware sampling\n- Reduction in human annotation requirements through targeted selection\n- Online generation and iterative refinement of training data\n- Focus on data quality over quantity with strategic filtering\n\nSources:\n- [Dynamic Data Selection for Reinforcement Learning](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-emnlp.412.pdf)\n- [The State Of LLMs 2025: Progress, Progress, and Predictions](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/state-of-llms-2025)\n- [GitHub - Awesome-RL-for-LRMs: A Survey](https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs)\n- [Toward large reasoning models: A survey](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12546433/)\n- [The State of Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-state-of-llm-reasoning-model-training)\n- [Curriculum Reinforcement Learning from Easy to Hard Tasks Improves LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06632)\n- [Towards Data-Centric RLHF](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/data-centric-rlhf)\n- [MM-RLHF](https://mm-rlhf.github.io/)\n- [SELF-EVOLVING CURRICULUM FOR LLM REASONING](https://openreview.net/pdf/0ef27194231b60f42775c4446a04fb05679fc2d5.pdf)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest information on data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025.","timestamp":42896},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":42896},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":42896},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":42896},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CGpbJRGpLhcxQkz9x7gtN4","status":"completed","timestamp":42896},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01K2vAw3Lq6viHgnAYQC2WYt","status":"completed","timestamp":42896},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BU4rdeHLpfpd6naxLDUX9m","status":"completed","timestamp":42896},{"type":"message","content":"Based on recent research, here are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024-2025:\n\n## Dynamic and Adaptive Data Selection\n\n**Dynamic Sampling & Filtering**: Recent methods start with diverse datasets (e.g., 220K problems) filtered to smaller candidate sets (8K samples) based on diversity and quality metrics.

The documentation links are highly relevant (citing both official docs and community discussions), the content is dense with technical specifics, and the markdown formatting makes the information easy to digest.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":false,"mcpToolCalled":false,"deterministicScore":70,"llmScore":30,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false,"graderLatency":10052.378546000022,"llmLatency":10052.312837000005}}}
{"id":"websearch-1856","input":"how to fix shetabit/visitor illuminate/support version constraint for laravel 10 11 12 in 2026","output":"The workspace is empty. Let me provide you with the solution to fix the shetabit/visitor illuminate/support version constraint issue for Laravel 10, 11, and 12:\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe `shetabit/visitor` package has dependency constraints on `illuminate/support` that may not be compatible with Laravel 10, 11, or 12. This is a common issue with packages that haven't been updated for newer Laravel versions.\n\n## Solutions (in order of preference)\n\n### 1. **Use a Fork or Updated Version**\n\nFirst, check if there's an updated fork that supports Laravel 10+:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor:dev-master\n```\n\n### 2. **Force Installation with --ignore-platform-reqs**\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\nOr update existing installation:\n```bash\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\n### 3. **Use Composer's Inline Alias (Recommended)**\n\nAdd this to your `composer.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"dev-master as 2.0\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen run:\n```bash\ncomposer update\n```\n\n### 4. **Override Version Constraints (Best for Production)**\n\nAdd this to your `composer.json` to override the illuminate/support constraint:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"^2.0\"\n    },\n    \"config\": {\n        \"allow-plugins\": {\n            \"pestphp/pest-plugin\": true\n        }\n    },\n    \"minimum-stability\": \"dev\",\n    \"prefer-stable\": true\n}\n```\n\nOr use the `conflict` resolution in composer.json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"*\"\n    },\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"laravel\": {\n            \"dont-discover\": []\n        }\n    },\n    \"config\": {\n        \"platform\": {\n            \"php\": \"8.1\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Create a Local Fork (Most Reliable for 2026)**\n\nSince we're in 2026 and the package may not be actively maintained:\n\n1. Fork the repository on GitHub\n2. Update the `composer.json` in your fork:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"php\": \"^8.1|^8.2|^8.3\",\n        \"illuminate/support\": \"^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\",\n        \"illuminate/database\": \"^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\",\n        \"jenssegers/agent\": \"^2.6\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. Use your fork in your project's composer.json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/visitor\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"dev-main\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 6. **Alternative: Use a Different Package**\n\nConsider using more actively maintained alternatives:\n- `stevebauman/location` - IP-based visitor tracking\n- `torann/geoip` - Geolocation package\n- Create a custom solution using Laravel's built-in features\n\n## Quick Fix Command\n\nIf you just want to install it now:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor --with-all-dependencies --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you implement any of these solutions in your project? If you have a composer.json file in a different location, let me know and I can help you update it directly.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you fix the version constraint issue with shetabit/visitor for Laravel 10, 11, and 12.
