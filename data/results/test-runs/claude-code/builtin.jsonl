This context is cleared when conversations end.\n\n**Long-Term Memory**: Persistent memory across sessions is stored as JSON documents in memory stores (like MongoDB) using namespaces and keys. This enables agents to remember user preferences and past decisions across multiple interactions.\n\n## State Management\n\nLangGraph's state system acts as shared memory that flows through nodes in the graph. Each node:\n- Receives the current state as input\n- Performs its logic\n- Returns only the state updates it wants to apply\n\nThe framework uses Python's `TypedDict` and `Annotated` types with reducer functions to handle complex state updates and prevent data loss in multi-agent systems.\n\n## RAG and Context Injection\n\n**Semantic Memory**: Implemented through RAG with vector embeddings stored in databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma. Retrieval happens based on semantic similarity.\n\n**Context Injection**: Memory is injected into prompts using functions like `get_memory` to fetch user preferences and enhance decision-making. This pattern is essential for planners, multi-hop RAG systems, and self-refining QA bots.\n\n**Prompt Templates**: Standardize system messages, user instructions, and context injection for predictable outputs.\n\n## 2026 Production Practices\n\n- **Entity-level trust scoring** for GraphRAG systems (not just document-level validation)\n- **Provenance tracking** for every node and edge in production implementations\n- Integration with tools like cognee for persistent semantic memory layers beyond simple key-value storage\n\nSources:\n- [Powering Long-Term Memory for Agents With LangGraph and MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/product-release-announcements/powering-long-term-memory-for-agents-langgraph)\n- [LangGraph for Stateful Agents: Tool-Chaining & Memory Injection](https://www.jellyfishtechnologies.com/using-langgraph-for-stateful-agents-with-tool-chaining-and-memory-injection/)\n- [Learn How to Build Reliable RAG Applications in 2026!](https://dev.to/pavanbelagatti/learn-how-to-build-reliable-rag-applications-in-2026-1b7p)\n- [Long-Term Agentic Memory With LangGraph](https://medium.com/@anil.jain.baba/long-term-agentic-memory-with-langgraph-824050b09852)\n- [The Architecture of Agent Memory: How LangGraph Really Works](https://dev.to/sreeni5018/the-architecture-of-agent-memory-how-langgraph-really-works-59ne)\n- [Building Agents With LangGraph Part 3/4: RAG and Long-Term Memory](https://blog.swmansion.com/building-agents-with-langgraph-part-3-4-rag-and-long-term-memory-ed34d4d96972)\n- [Mastering LangGraph State Management in 2025](https://sparkco.ai/blog/mastering-langgraph-state-management-in-2025)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about LangGraph memory state management and RAG context injection.","timestamp":37366},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":37366},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018cmdL5rhMLTvQ3vugwuTQM","status":"completed","timestamp":37366},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest information, here's what you need to know about LangGraph memory state management and RAG context injection in 2026:\n\n## Memory Architecture\n\n**Short-Term Memory**: LangGraph uses \"threads\" with checkpointers to automatically manage working memory within a session.
