HIGH\n```\n\n### 4. **Severity-Based Management**\n```bash\n# Skip all LOW and MEDIUM severity checks\ncheckov --skip-check MEDIUM --bc-api-key API_KEY\n\n# Combine allowlist and denylist\ncheckov --check CKV_AWS_* --skip-check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_19\n```\n\n## Production Best Practices for 2026\n\n### 1. **Version Control Exception Management**\n- Store all configuration files (`.tfsec.yaml`, `.checkov.yaml`, `.checkov.baseline`) in version control\n- Require code review for any changes to exception files\n- Use expiration dates on inline ignores to force periodic review\n\n### 2. **CI/CD Integration**\n```yaml\n# Example GitHub Actions workflow\n- name: Run Trivy (tfsec successor)\n  run: |\n    trivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL \\\n      --exit-code 1 \\\n      --format sarif \\\n      --output trivy-results.sarif .\n\n- name: Run Checkov with baseline\n  run: |\n    checkov -d . \\\n      --baseline .checkov.baseline \\\n      --hard-fail-on CRITICAL,HIGH \\\n      --soft-fail-on MEDIUM,LOW \\\n      --output-format json \\\n      --output-file-path checkov-results.json\n```\n\n### 3. **Exception Documentation Strategy**\n- Always include justification comments with exceptions\n- Track exceptions in a central registry (spreadsheet/database)\n- Set review dates for all exceptions\n- Use expiration dates on temporary exceptions\n\n### 4. **Layered Approach**\n```bash\n# Pre-commit: Catch issues early with soft fails\ncheckov -d . --soft-fail\n\n# PR Pipeline: More strict with baseline\ncheckov -d . --baseline .checkov.baseline --hard-fail-on HIGH,CRITICAL\n\n# Production deployment: Strictest settings\ncheckov -d . --hard-fail-on CRITICAL --compact\n```\n\n### 5. **Baseline Maintenance**\n- Regenerate baselines quarterly or after major releases\n- Review and reduce exceptions over time\n- Use baseline diffs to track security posture improvements\n\n### 6. **Combined Scanning Strategy**\nUse both tools together for comprehensive coverage:\n\n```bash\n# Run both in CI/CD\ntrivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL . && \\\ncheckov -d . --baseline .checkov.baseline --hard-fail-on CRITICAL,HIGH\n```\n\n## Monitoring and Reporting\n\nTrack exception metrics:\n- Number of active exceptions\n- Age of exceptions\n- Exceptions by severity\n- Trend over time (increasing/decreasing)\n\nThis helps demonstrate security posture improvements to stakeholders.\n\nSources:\n- [Top 7 Terraform Scanning Tools You Should Know in 2026](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-scanning-tools)\n- [Terraform Security Scanning in CI: Using tfsec and Checkov with GitHub Actions](https://terrateam.io/blog/terraform-security-scanning-tfsec-checkov-github-actions)\n- [Ignoring Checks -

Tailwind v4 Configuration\n\nLeave the `tailwind` config empty in `components.json` when using Tailwind CSS v4.\n\n## Using Components\n\nImport from the shared package:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { useTheme } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-theme\"\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n```\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **60% faster component development** (based on team reports)\n- Unified, themeable component system\n- Automatic workspace path resolution\n- Simplified dependency management across apps\n- Built-in Turborepo caching and parallel builds\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Monorepo - shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo)\n- [shadcn/ui | Turborepo](https://turborepo.dev/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui)\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI with Turborepo](https://medium.com/techtrends-digest/the-complete-guide-to-shadcn-ui-and-turborepo-integration-efd41efeed31)\n- [How to Implement Shadcn UI with Tailwind v4 in a Turborepo](https://medium.com/@soumyadipdutta1004/how-to-implement-shadcn-in-a-turborepo-b7853c65e699)\n- [GitHub - dan5py/turborepo-shadcn-ui](https://github.com/dan5py/turborepo-shadcn-ui)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo.

Ensure Data Quality**\nImplement robust data profiling, cleansing, and validation to identify irregularities, remove duplicates, and correct errors. Automated quality checks should be built into the pipeline from the start, not added as an afterthought.\n\n**2. Automate Repetitive Tasks**\nAutomation reduces human error, delays, and operational costs. Modern ETL tools leverage AI to detect errors, manage data flows, and support real-time insights.\n\n**3. Implement Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability**\nTransform your ETL process from a black box into a transparent system with automated alerts and dashboards. This helps teams spot trends, address issues quickly, and ensure data trustworthiness.\n\n**4. Maintain Thorough Documentation**\nClear documentation is essential for pipelines that are easier to maintain, troubleshoot, and scale. This includes data lineage, transformation logic, and dependency mappings.\n\n**5. Design for Scalability**\nUse microservices architecture where each stage (extract, transform, load) can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Implement parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently.\n\n## Modern Architecture Trends\n\n**6. Consider ELT Over ETL**\nFor most modern data stacks, ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) is now the recommended approach. ETL still makes sense for small datasets requiring complex transformations or legacy system integrations.\n\n**7. Implement Strong Error Handling and Fault Tolerance**\nDesign pipelines to handle errors and failures gracefully without disrupting data flow or compromising integrity. Unplanned downtime costs approximately $5,600 per minute on average.\n\n**8. Focus on Security and Compliance**\nImplement data masking for regulated data and ensure your ETL platform has appropriate compliance certifications (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.).\n\n## Key Statistics\n\nOrganizations implementing proper ETL best practices in 2025 report:\n- 73% faster time-to-insight\n- 45% reduction in data-related errors\n\nSources:\n- [ETL Pipeline best practices for reliable data workflows | dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/etl-pipeline-best-practices)\n- [ETL Pipelines: 5 Key Components and 5 Critical Best Practices | Dagster Guides](https://dagster.io/guides/etl-pipelines-5-key-components-and-5-critical-best-practices)\n- [ETL Frameworks in 2025 for Future-Proof Data Pipelines | Integrate.io](https://www.integrate.io/blog/etl-frameworks-in-2025-designing-robust-future-proof-data-pipelines/)\n- [5 ETL Pipeline Best Practices (And What Yours is Missing) | Perforce Software](https://www.perforce.com/blog/pdx/etl-pipeline-best-practices)\n- [ETL Pipeline Guide for 2025: Key Trends & Best Practices](https://kanerika.com/blogs/etl-pipeline/)\n- [7 ETL best practices: How to build reliable, scalable data pipelines – Celigo](https://www.celigo.com/blog/7-etl-best-practices-for-building-data-pipelines-that-scale/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025.","timestamp":34598},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":34598},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RQGmR6T8YbB9jSJYiXy6C2","status":"completed","timestamp":34598},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest information, here are the key **ETL data pipeline best practices for 2025**:\n\n## Core Best Practices\n\n**1.

This includes data profiling to identify irregularities, data cleansing to remove duplicates and correct errors, and automated validation rules. Implementing quality checks before loading reduces downstream problems and improves scalability.\n\n**Automation**\nAutomating repetitive tasks is essential to eliminate human error, which causes delays, inconsistencies, and higher operational costs. This includes automated scheduling, data validation, and error handling.\n\n**Orchestration and Workflow Management**\nProper orchestration involves sequencing and scheduling tasks, managing dependencies between pipeline stages, and monitoring progress across the entire workflow.\n\n**Monitoring and Observability**\nTransform your ETL process from a black box into a transparent system with comprehensive monitoring. Automated alerts, dashboards, and logging help teams spot trends, address issues quickly, and ensure data trustworthiness.\n\n**Documentation**\nClear, thorough documentation is fundamental for maintainability, troubleshooting, and scaling. Teams that invest in documentation build pipelines that are easier to manage over time.\n\n## Modern Architectural Approaches\n\n**Microservices Architecture**\nModern frameworks increasingly use microservices where each stage (extract, transform, load) can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, particularly beneficial for large datasets.\n\n**Real-Time Processing**\nReal-time ETL leverages event brokers like Kafka or Redpanda for stream processing, where events are ingested, enriched, and transformed in-stream before routing to storage or analytics layers.\n\n**Metadata Management**\nStrong metadata management is critical for data governance, auditability, and debugging capabilities.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n**Parallel Processing**\nImplement parallel processing to execute multiple ETL processes concurrently, significantly reducing runtime and improving efficiency.\n\n**Security and Compliance**\nImplement consistent, scalable compliance efforts including data masking, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive data.\n\nAccording to recent industry studies, organizations implementing these best practices report 73% faster time-to-insight and 45% reduction in data-related errors.\n\nSources:\n- [ETL Pipeline best practices for reliable data workflows | dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/etl-pipeline-best-practices)\n- [ETL Pipelines: 5 Key Components and 5 Critical Best Practices | Dagster Guides](https://dagster.io/guides/etl-pipelines-5-key-components-and-5-critical-best-practices)\n- [ETL Frameworks in 2025 for Future-Proof Data Pipelines | Integrate.io](https://www.integrate.io/blog/etl-frameworks-in-2025-designing-robust-future-proof-data-pipelines/)\n- [5 ETL Pipeline Best Practices (And What Yours is Missing) | Perforce Software](https://www.perforce.com/blog/pdx/etl-pipeline-best-practices)\n- [ETL Pipeline Guide for 2025: Key Trends & Best Practices](https://kanerika.com/blogs/etl-pipeline/)\n- [7 ETL best practices: How to build reliable, scalable data pipelines – Celigo](https://www.celigo.com/blog/7-etl-best-practices-for-building-data-pipelines-that-scale/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025.","timestamp":33264},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":33264},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NfEZnnmvdQXS66GLs4bsaK","status":"completed","timestamp":33264},{"type":"message","content":"Based on current industry standards, here are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025:\n\n## Core Best Practices\n\n**Data Quality Management**\nData quality checks should be integrated throughout your ETL process, not added as an afterthought.

Leverage Native Bounding Box Detection with Custom Instructions\n\nVertex AI's Gemini models support prompt-based bounding box detection without requiring custom model training. You can provide natural language instructions like:\n- \"Identify and provide bounding boxes for all lung nodules in this CT scan\"\n- \"Draw bounding boxes around areas of inflammation in this X-ray\"\n\nBounding boxes are returned in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format with coordinates normalized to 0-1000.\n\n## 2. Use Multimodal Prompting with Medical Context\n\nDesign prompts that combine:\n- **Visual input**: Medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRI)\n- **Clinical context**: Patient history, symptoms, or specific diagnostic criteria\n- **Task specification**: Clear instructions about what anatomical structures or abnormalities to detect\n\nExample: \"Given this chest X-ray of a patient with persistent cough, identify and bound all areas showing potential infiltrates or consolidation.\"\n\n## 3. Employ MedGemma for Specialized Medical Tasks\n\nMedGemma 1.5 (released January 2026) is specifically designed for medical imaging:\n- 4-billion-parameter multimodal model\n- Trained on MIMIC-CXR dataset with anatomically-grounded bounding boxes (ChestImaGenome)\n- Handles complex 3D medical images (CT/MRI scans)\n- Available through Vertex AI Model Garden\n\n## 4. Apply Weak Supervision with Prompt Learning\n\nRecent research (July 2025) shows combining foundation models with prompt learning for medical image segmentation. This approach:\n- Automates prompt generation\n- Uses bounding box constraints to guide segmentation\n- Reduces annotation requirements\n- Improves accuracy in medical contexts\n\n## 5. Reasoning-Based Object Detection\n\nLeverage Gemini's spatial understanding to find objects based on user-defined criteria rather than just pattern matching:\n- \"Identify lesions larger than 5mm with irregular borders\"\n- \"Find calcifications in the left breast quadrant\"\n- Use reasoning capabilities to filter results based on clinical significance\n\n## 6. Best Practices for Medical Imaging Prompts\n\n**Image Quality**:\n- Ensure objects are clear and not largely obscured\n- Use high-resolution medical images when possible\n\n**Prompt Specificity**:\n- Specify anatomical regions clearly\n- Define what constitutes a positive finding\n- Include relevant clinical criteria (size, shape, density)\n\n**Iterative Refinement**:\n- Start with broad detection requests\n- Refine based on false positives/negatives\n- Use Vertex AI Studio to test and customize prompts\n\n## 7. Integration with Clinical Workflows\n\nCombine bounding box detection with:\n- Text-based clinical reasoning (using MedLM for clinical notes)\n- Multi-image comparison (serial scans for progression tracking)\n- Structured output formatting for PACS integration\n\nThe key advantage in 2026 is that Vertex AI's Gemini models can perform zero-shot bounding box detection on medical images with properly engineered prompts, eliminating the need for extensive labeled training data while maintaining clinical accuracy.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Bounding box detection - Vertex AI Documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection)\n- [Prompt learning with bounding box constraints for medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02743)\n- [Design multimodal prompts - Vertex AI Documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/design-multimodal-prompts)\n- [MedGemma 1.5: Google's Open AI for Healthcare](https://www.webpronews.com/medgemma-1-5-googles-open-ai-unlocks-3d-scans-and-clinical-speech-for-healthcare-builders/)\n- [Next generation medical image interpretation with MedGemma 1.5](https://research.google/blog/next-generation-medical-image-interpretation-with-medgemma-15-and-medical-speech-to-text-with-medasr/)\n- [Hands-on Gemini 2.5 for Computer Vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/get-hands-on-with-google-gemini-2-5-for-computer-vision-tasks)\n- [What Is Vertex AI?

Custom Instruction Prompting**\nVertex AI's bounding box detection allows you to produce bounding boxes based on custom instructions without training a custom model.

Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Prompting**\n- **Zero-shot**: Trigger detection with a single instruction describing the medical structure\n- **One-shot/Few-shot**: Include example images with existing annotations to help the model understand the task context\n- Recent research shows significant improvements with few-shot approaches (FAP gains of 4.83% in 1-shot, 12.88% in 10-shot settings)\n\n**3. Instance-Level Prompt Generation (iPG)**\nThe iDPA framework introduces techniques that decouple fine-grained instance-level knowledge from medical images to generate prompts focused on dense predictions, particularly effective for multiple object detection in medical scans.\n\n## Medical Imaging-Specific Techniques\n\n**4. Multi-Slice/Multi-Patch Prompting**\nWith MedGemma 1.5 integration in Vertex AI, you can provide:\n- Multiple CT/MRI slices as input with task-describing prompts\n- Multiple histopathology patches for comprehensive analysis\n\n**5. Task-Specific Prompt Customization**\nIncorporate domain-specific medical terminology and context:\n- Specify tissue types, anatomical regions, or pathology characteristics\n- Use clinical context to improve accuracy (e.g., \"segment nodules in lung CT consistent with malignancy\")\n\n**6. Prompt Engineering for Pre-trained Models**\nOptimize prompt structure to activate implicit medical knowledge without extensive fine-tuning:\n- Use clear, specific anatomical language\n- Include contextual clinical information\n- Specify the type of bounding box precision required\n\n## Implementation Best Practices\n\n**7. Structured Input Format**\n- Provide prompt + associated medical images/video frames\n- Output format: [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] with coordinates normalized to 0-1000\n\n**8. Iterative Prompt Refinement**\n- Start simple and add specificity\n- Break complex detection tasks into simpler components\n- Experiment with different parameter values\n- Use prefixes for clarity (e.g., \"Medical task: \", \"Detect: \")\n\n**9. Visual + Textual Prompts**\nCombine multiple prompt modalities:\n- Textual instructions describing the detection task\n- Visual prompts showing example regions\n- Learnable embeddings for task-specific adaptation\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n**10. Transfer Learning with Minimal Data**\nLeverage prompt engineering for data-scarce medical imaging settings:\n- Use foundation models adapted through prompting rather than full retraining\n- Particularly valuable in specialized medical imaging domains with limited labeled datasets\n\nThe combination of Vertex AI's no-code bounding box detection with advanced prompt engineering techniques and medical-specific models like MedGemma represents a significant advancement for healthcare AI applications in 2026.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Bounding box detection | Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection)\n- [Next generation medical image interpretation with MedGemma 1.5](https://research.google/blog/next-generation-medical-image-interpretation-with-medgemma-15-and-medical-speech-to-text-with-medasr/)\n- [iDPA: Instance Decoupled Prompt Attention for Incremental Medical Object Detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hcjXy7kLFd)\n- [Vision-language foundation models for medical imaging](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13534-025-00484-6)\n- [Prompt Mechanisms in Medical Imaging: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01055)\n- [Large models in medical imaging: Advances and prospects](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12273654/)\n- [Overview of prompting strategies | Vertex AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest information on prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026.","timestamp":44248},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":44248},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":44248},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":44248},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01L6Biwp6H8uaxiQg6WxkZY9","status":"completed","timestamp":44248},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NDd6ATN7KNftxkLpw95CaP","status":"completed","timestamp":44248},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014naumpvWQpJoszgFdd7tUc","status":"completed","timestamp":44248},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest research and documentation from 2026, here are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI:\n\n## Core Prompting Strategies\n\n**1.

click patterns, scroll behavior)\n\n### 2. **IP Intelligence**\n- **Reputation scoring**: Use services like IPQualityScore, MaxMind GeoIP2, or Spur.us to identify:\n  - Known proxy/VPN exit nodes\n  - Data center IPs vs residential IPs\n  - TOR exit nodes\n  - Recently created or suspicious IPs\n- **Geolocation anomalies**: Flag mismatches between IP location, shipping address, payment method location\n- **IP rotation patterns**: Detect when multiple IPs access the same session/account in short timeframes\n\n### 3. **Device Fingerprinting**\nModern approaches combine multiple signals:\n- **TLS fingerprinting**: Analyze TLS handshake patterns\n- **HTTP/2 fingerprinting**: Check connection characteristics\n- **Browser API inconsistencies**: Detect headless browsers and automation tools\n- **Hardware attributes**: GPU, CPU cores, memory (harder to spoof)\n\n### 4. **Machine Learning Models**\nTrain models on:\n- Historical attack patterns\n- Legitimate user behavior baselines\n- Real-time anomaly detection\n- Graph analysis for detecting coordinated attacks\n\n## Prevention Techniques\n\n### 1. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**\n```javascript\n// Example: Multi-layered rate limiting\n{\n  \"per_ip\": \"100 requests/minute\",\n  \"per_session\": \"50 requests/minute\", \n  \"per_endpoint\": {\n    \"checkout\": \"5 requests/minute\",\n    \"add_to_cart\": \"20 requests/minute\",\n    \"search\": \"30 requests/minute\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Progressive Challenges**\n- **Risk-based authentication**: Require additional verification for suspicious activity\n- **CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA v3**: Use invisible scoring for low-friction verification\n- **Device verification**: SMS, email, or authenticator app challenges\n- **Proof-of-work challenges**: Make automated requests computationally expensive\n\n### 3. **Session Integrity**\n- **Cryptographic tokens**: Bind sessions to specific device fingerprints\n- **Short-lived tokens**: Reduce window for credential reuse\n- **Token rotation**: Invalidate tokens on IP/fingerprint changes\n- **CSRF protection**: Prevent cross-site request forgery\n\n### 4. **Business Logic Controls**\n- **Purchase limits**: Restrict quantity per user/address/payment method\n- **Waiting periods**: Add delays for high-demand items\n- **Invite/lottery systems**: For limited releases\n- **Account reputation**: Require account age/history for high-value purchases\n\n### 5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**\n- Use cloud-based WAF services (Cloudflare, AWS WAF, Akamai)\n- Custom rules for your traffic patterns\n- Bot management solutions (PerimeterX, DataDome, Kasada)\n\n## Modern 2026 Technologies\n\n### 1. **AI-Powered Bot Detection**\n- **Adaptive models**: Self-learning systems that evolve with attack patterns\n- **Federated learning**: Share threat intelligence across platforms\n- **Real-time scoring**: Sub-100ms risk assessment\n\n### 2. **Blockchain-Based Identity**\n- **Decentralized identity verification**: Reduce credential stuffing\n- **On-chain reputation systems**: Track user trustworthiness\n\n### 3. **Edge Computing**\n- **CDN-level filtering**: Block threats before reaching origin servers\n- **Distributed validation**: Process checks closer to users\n\n### 4. **Privacy-Preserving Detection**\n- **Differential privacy**: Analyze patterns without exposing user data\n- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Verify authenticity without revealing information\n\n## Implementation Architecture Example\n\n```\nUser Request\n    ↓\n[CDN/WAF Layer] → Basic filtering, DDoS protection\n    ↓\n[Bot Detection Service] → Device fingerprinting, IP reputation\n    ↓\n[Rate Limiter] → Multi-layered throttling\n    ↓\n[ML Risk Scoring] → Real-time behavioral analysis\n    ↓  (if suspicious)\n[Challenge System] → CAPTCHA, 2FA, device verification\n    ↓\n[Application Layer] → Business logic validation\n    ↓\n[Fraud Detection] → Payment/order analysis\n```\n\n## Key Metrics to Monitor\n\n1. **Attack indicators**: Failed authentication rates, CAPTCHA solve rates, IP diversity\n2. **Business impact**: Conversion rates, legitimate user friction, false positive rates\n3. **System health**: API latency, detection service performance, cost per request\n\n## Recommended Tools/Services\n\n- **Cloudflare Bot Management**: Comprehensive bot detection\n- **DataDome**: Real-time bot protection\n- **PerimeterX**: Advanced bot defense\n- **FingerprintJS**: Open-source browser fingerprinting\n- **OWASP ModSecurity**: Open-source WAF\n- **Elastic Stack**: Log analysis and anomaly detection\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Layer your defenses**: No single method is foolproof\n2. **Balance security and UX**: Minimize friction for legitimate users\n3. **Monitor and adapt**: Attackers evolve, so must your defenses\n4. **Share intelligence**: Participate in threat-sharing communities\n5. **Test regularly**: Run penetration tests and red team exercises\n6. **Comply with privacy laws**: Ensure GDPR, CCPA compliance in fingerprinting\n\nThe key is combining multiple detection and prevention layers to make automated attacks economically unfeasible while keeping the experience smooth for legitimate users.","timestamp":32275}],"duration":32275,"pass":false,"score":0.63,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 35/70 (basic=10, tools=0,
