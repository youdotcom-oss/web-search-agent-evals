As of 2026, the best practices have evolved to treat exceptions as a core\n part of the security workflow, rather than an afterthought.\n\nHere's how to manage Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tf\nsec and Checkov in production for 2026:\n\n### **1. Methods for Managing Exceptions**\n\nThere\n are three primary methods for managing exceptions in tfsec and Checkov:\n\n*   **Inline Ignore Comments**: For targeted\n, one-off exceptions, you can add a comment to the line of code that is causing the violation. This is the\n most direct way to ignore a finding, but it can become difficult to manage at scale.\n\n    *   **tf\nsec**: Add a comment with `#tfsec:ignore:<RULE_ID>` on the line before the resource block. You\n can also add an expiry date and a comment.\n\n        \n```terraform\n        #tfsec:ignore:AWS0\n06 expiration:2026-12-31 A necessary exception for a public S3 bucket\n        \nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"public\" {\n          bucket = \"my-public-bucket\"\n          \nacl    = \"public-read\"\n        }\n        \n```\n\n\n    *   **Checkov**: Add a\n comment with `checkov:skip=<CHECK_ID>:<SUPPRESSION_COMMENT>` on the line before the resource block\n.\n\n        \n```terraform\n        #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Public S3 bucket for website\n hosting\n        resource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"public\" {\n          bucket = \"my-public-bucket\n\"\n          acl    = \"public-read\"\n        }\n        \n```\n\n\n*   **Configuration Files**:\n For broader exceptions, such as ignoring a rule across an entire project, you can use a configuration file. This is a cleaner\n way to manage exceptions that apply to multiple resources.\n\n    *   **tfsec**: Create a `.tfsec.\nyml` file in your project's root directory to exclude directories or rules.\n\n        \n```yaml\n        ---\n        exclude\n:\n          - aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging\n        \n```\n\n\n    *   **Checkov**: Create\n a `.checkov.yml` file in your project's root directory to skip checks or directories.\n\n        \n```yaml\n\n        ---\n        skip-check:\n          - CKV_AWS_18\n        \n```\n\n\n*   **\nBaseline Files**: To establish a baseline of existing vulnerabilities, you can create a baseline file that contains a list of all current\n findings. This allows you to focus on new issues while you work to resolve the existing ones.\n\n    *   **\ntfsec**: `tfsec` does not have a dedicated baseline feature, but you can achieve a similar result by using a configuration\n file to ignore all current findings.\n    *   **Checkov**: You can create a baseline of issues by running `checkov\n --baseline -o .checkov.baseline` and then referencing it in future scans with `checkov --baseline .\ncheckov.baseline`.\n\n### **2. Best Practices for Managing Exceptions in Production for 2026**\n\nIn\n 2026, managing exceptions is not just about ignoring them, but about doing so in a way that is secure,\n transparent, and auditable.\n\n*   **Time-Bound Exceptions**: Never create a permanent exception. Always include an expiration date in\n your ignore comments or configuration files. This forces you to re-evaluate the exception in the future and ensures that it doesn\n't become a permanent security hole.\n*   **Justification and Documentation**: Every exception must have a clear and concise\n justification. This should be included in the ignore comment or a separate document that is referenced in the comment. This documentation is crucial for security\n audits and for helping other developers understand why the exception was made.\n*   **Approval Workflow**: Implement a formal approval process\n for all exceptions. This can be done through pull requests and code reviews, where the security team or other stakeholders must approve\n the exception before it is merged into the main branch.\n*   **Policy-as-Code (PaC)**: For\n large organizations, managing exceptions with inline comments and configuration files can be cumbersome. A better approach is to use a policy-as\n-code framework like Open Policy Agent (OPA) to manage exceptions in a more automated and scalable way. With OPA, you\n can write policies that define when and why exceptions are allowed, and these policies can be enforced automatically in your CI/CD\n pipeline.\n*   **Centralized Management**: To ensure consistency and control, manage your exception policies in a centralized repository.\n This makes it easier to update and audit your policies and ensures that all teams are following the same rules.\n*   **Regular\n Auditing and Reporting**: Regularly audit all exceptions and generate reports to track your organization's security posture over time. This will help you\n identify trends, spot potential security risks, and ensure that your exception management process is effective.\n\n### **3. The Future of\n IaC Security (Looking Towards 2026)**\n\nThe field of IaC security is constantly evolving, and by\n 2026, we can expect to see even more advanced tools and techniques for managing security risks.\n\n*   \n**AI-Powered Analysis**: AI and machine learning will play an increasingly important role in IaC security. AI-powered tools will\n be able to prioritize vulnerabilities, suggest fixes, and even automatically generate exceptions with justifications.\n*   **Graph-Based\n Analysis**: Tools like Checkov are already using graph-based analysis to understand the relationships between resources and identify complex security risks.\n By 2026, this will be a standard feature in most IaC security scanners.\n*   **Integration with Other\n Tools**: IaC security scanners will be more tightly integrated with other security tools, such as container scanners, vulnerability scanners, and security\n information and event management (SIEM) systems. This will provide a more holistic view of your organization's security posture.\n\nBy\n following these best practices, you can effectively manage Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in production in 202\n6 and beyond. The key is to treat exceptions as a core part of your security workflow and to use automation and policy\n-as-code to manage them in a secure, transparent, and scalable way.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","timestamp":59768},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":59768},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769682319744-f05f2ed47522c","status":"completed","timestamp":59768},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769682332893-c76b34460b711","status":"completed","timestamp":59768},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":59768},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682347766-2e3b80321f021","status":"completed","timestamp":59768},{"type":"message","content":"Managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in production for 2026 involves a combination of in","timestamp":59768},{"type":"message","content":"-code annotations, configuration files, and policy-as-code (PaC) frameworks, with an increasing emphasis on automation and","timestamp":59768},{"type":"message","content":" time-bound exceptions.

Here'\ns a guide on how to approach this in 2026.\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n*   **Baseline:**\n A baseline is a snapshot of the current security findings that are considered acceptable. Subsequent scans will only report new findings, allowing\n you to focus on recent changes.\n*   **Exceptions (or Suppressions):** These are deliberate decisions to ignore\n a specific security warning for a particular resource.

Both `tfsec` and `checkov` offer mechanisms for handling baseline exceptions. Here's a guide\n on how to manage them effectively, with a forward-looking perspective for 2026.\n\n### `tfsec\n` Exception Management\n\nAs of early 2024, `tfsec` is being consolidated into Aqua Security's \n`Trivy` scanner. While `tfsec` is still widely used, for a 2026 production\n environment, it is recommended to consider `Trivy` for a more comprehensive and future-proof solution. The methods\n for ignoring rules in `tfsec` are likely to be supported in `Trivy` for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nThe primary way to manage exceptions in `tfsec` is through in-code comments. This approach is transparent and keeps\n the exceptions version-controlled alongside the code.\n\n**Ignoring a Single Rule:**\n\nTo ignore a specific `tfsec` rule\n for a resource, add a comment on the same line as the violation or on the line directly above it.\n\n\n```terraform\n\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"my_bucket\" {\n  bucket = \"my-tf\nsec-testing-bucket\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\" #tfsec:ignore:AWS00\n2\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Ignoring a Block:**\n\nTo ignore a rule for an entire resource block, place the comment on the\n line above the block's definition.\n\n\n```terraform\n#tfsec:ignore:AWS002\nresource \"aws_\ns3_bucket\" \"my_bucket\" {\n  bucket = \"my-tfsec-testing-bucket\n\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### `checkov` Exception Management\n\n\n`checkov` provides a more robust set of features for managing exceptions, including a baseline file and in-code comments.\n\n**\nUsing a Baseline File:**\n\nThe baseline feature is the recommended way to manage a large number of existing findings.\n\n1.  **\nCreate a Baseline:**\n    Generate a baseline file that contains all the current security findings. This file should be checked into your\n version control system.\n\n    \n```bash\n    checkov -d . --create-baseline\n    ```\n\n    This will\n create a `.checkov.baseline` file in the current directory.\n\n2.  **Run Scans with the\n Baseline:**\n    In your CI/CD pipeline, run `checkov` with the `--baseline` flag. This will only\n report new findings that are not present in the baseline file.\n\n    \n```bash\n    checkov -d . --baseline .\ncheckov.baseline\n    \n```\n\n\n**Skipping Checks with In-Code Comments:**\n\nSimilar to `tfsec\n`, you can use in-code comments to skip checks for specific resources. This is useful for one-off exceptions.\n\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"my_bucket\" {\n  bucket = \"my-check\nov-testing-bucket\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n\n  # checkov:skip=\nCKV_AWS_18:This bucket is intentionally public for website hosting\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Best Practices for Production\n in 2026\n\n*   **Version Control Everything:** Whether you use in-code comments or baseline files, all exceptions\n should be stored in your Git repository. This provides an audit trail and ensures that exceptions are reviewed as part of your pull\n request process.\n*   **Justify All Exceptions:** Every ignored rule or skipped check should have a clear and concise\n justification. For `checkov`, the justification can be included in the comment. For `tfsec`, use a separate\n comment or include it in the commit message.\n*   **Regularly Review Exceptions:** Schedule periodic reviews of your baseline\n files and in-code exceptions. As your infrastructure and security requirements evolve, some exceptions may no longer be valid.\n*   **\nEmbrace Policy-as-Code:** For a more mature and centralized approach, consider using a policy-as-code framework like\n Open Policy Agent (OPA). You can write custom policies to enforce your organization's specific security requirements and manage exceptions in\n a more granular way.\n*   **Tool Consolidation:** By 2026, the DevSecOps tool\n landscape will likely have evolved. Given the consolidation of `tfsec` into `Trivy`, it's wise\n to standardize on a single, comprehensive tool that can scan for a wide range of issues (IaC, vulnerabilities, etc\n.). This will simplify your toolchain and reduce the management overhead of exceptions.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","timestamp":30024},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":30024},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682479259-d5ea72b3749a3","status":"completed","timestamp":30024},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682479277-53826393513bc8","status":"completed","timestamp":30024},{"type":"message","content":"Managing security scanning exceptions for Terraform is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture in a","timestamp":30024},{"type":"message","content":" production environment.

As of early 2026, the landscape has evolved, with `tfsec`'\ns functionality being integrated into `Trivy`. Therefore, this guide will focus on managing exceptions for **Checkov** and\n **Trivy**.\n\nHere are the recommended strategies for managing baseline exceptions in production:\n\n### 1. In\n-Code Suppressions (The Preferred Method for Specific Exceptions)\n\nFor individual resources that have a known and accepted reason for failing\n a security check, the best practice is to suppress the finding directly in the Terraform code. This approach is self-documenting and\n keeps the exception context close to the resource.\n\n**Checkov:**\n\nUse a comment with the format `#checkov:skip=<\nCHECK_ID>:<SUPPRESSION_REASON>` on the line preceding the resource definition.\n\n\n```terraform\n#check\nov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:This S3 bucket is used for public website hosting and requires public\n read access.\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"website_bucket\" {\n  bucket = \"\nmy-public-website-bucket\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n\n  # ... other configuration\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Trivy (formerly tfsec):**\n\nUse a comment with the format `#t\nrivy:ignore=<CHECK_ID>` on the line preceding the resource definition. You can also add an expiry date and\n a comment.\n\n\n```terraform\n#trivy:ignore:AVD-AWS-0086 expr\n:=\"END_OF_Q2_2026\" This is a legacy bucket that will be replaced.\n\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"legacy_bucket\" {\n  bucket = \"my-legacy-data\n-bucket\"\n  # ... other configuration\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Configuration Files (For Project-Wide Bas\nelines)\n\nWhen you have a set of checks you want to ignore across an entire project, using a configuration file is\n a cleaner approach than adding comments to every resource.\n\n**Checkov:**\n\nCreate a `.checkov.yaml` file\n in the root of your repository to specify checks to skip.\n\n\n```yaml\n# .checkov.yaml\nskip-\ncheck:\n  - CKV_AWS_18  # Ensure IAM policies are attached only to groups or roles\n\n  - CKV_AWS_28  # Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at\n rest\n\n```\n\n\n**Trivy:**\n\nCreate a `.trivyignore` file in the root of your repository to\n list the finding IDs to ignore.\n\n\n```\n# .trivyignore\nAVD-AWS-002\n2\nAVD-AWS-0057\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (For Dynamic\n and Temporary Exceptions)\n\nFor exceptions that are specific to a particular environment or need to be managed dynamically, you can use\n command-line flags in your CI/CD pipeline.\n\n**Checkov:**\n\nUse the `--skip-check` flag\n in your CI script.\n\n\n```bash\n# In your .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, or GitHub\n Actions workflow\ncheckov --directory . --skip-check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_28\n\n\n```\n\n\n**Trivy:**\n\nUse the `--ignore-unfixed` flag to ignore vulnerabilities that do not have a\n fix yet, or `--severity` to filter by severity. You can also use a Rego file for more advanced filtering with\n `--ignore-policy`.\n\n\n```bash\n# In your .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, or GitHub\n Actions workflow\ntrivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .\n\n```\n\n\n### Best Practices for Managing Baselines in 2\n026\n\n*   **Shift Left:** Integrate `checkov` and `trivy` into your local\n development environment using pre-commit hooks. This helps catch issues before they are even committed to version control.\n*   **Document\n Everything:** When you suppress a finding, always provide a clear and concise reason. This is crucial for security audits and for\n future team members to understand the context.\n*   **Regularly Review Your Baseline:** Schedule periodic reviews (e.g.,\n quarterly) of your ignored findings.

Here’s a breakdown of how to manage exceptions for both tools with a forward-looking perspective.\n\n### Managing tf\nsec Exceptions\n\nFor tfsec, the primary method for managing exceptions is through in-code comments. This is a deliberate\n design choice to make exceptions visible and auditable within the code itself.\n\n**1. In-Code Ignores with\n Expiration Dates:**\n\nThe best practice is to add a comment directly above or on the same line as the offending code\n block. A forward-looking best practice for 2026 is to always include an expiration date for the ignore\n, forcing a review of the exception in the future.\n\n\n```terraform\n# tfsec:ignore:AWS006\n exp:2026-12-31 Reason: Legacy system requires this port open temporarily.\nresource \"\naws_security_group_rule\" \"my_rule\" {\n  type        = \"ingress\"\n  from\n_port   = 22\n  to_port     = 22\n  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Central\nized Configuration:**\n\nWhile not for individual resource exceptions, you can use a `.tfsec/config.yml` file to exclude\n checks globally for a project. This is useful for checks that are not applicable to your environment.\n\n\n```yaml\n# .\ntfsec/config.yml\nexclude:\n  - AWS018 # Example: Exclude check for S\n3 bucket logging if you have a centralized logging solution.\n\n```\n\n\n**Future Outlook for tfsec:**\n\nAqua Security is\n consolidating tfsec into Trivy. By 2026, you will likely be using Trivy for your Terraform\n scanning. The principles will remain the same, but the command and configuration might change. Keep an eye on the Trivy project for\n the latest developments.\n\n### Managing checkov Exceptions\n\nCheckov offers two primary methods for managing exceptions: in-code skips\n and baseline files.\n\n**1. In-Code Skips:**\n\nSimilar to tfsec, you can add a\n comment to a resource to skip a check.\n\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"my_bucket\n\" {\n  bucket = \"my-unique-bucket-name\"\n  # checkov:skip=CKV_\nAWS_18: \"Ensure the S3 bucket has access logging enabled\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Baseline Files\n (Recommended for Production):**\n\nFor production environments with a large number of existing findings, the baseline feature is the most effective\n way to manage exceptions. This allows you to \"accept\" the current state and only fail the build for *new* issues.\n\n\n**Workflow for using baselines:**\n\n1.  **Create an initial baseline:** Run checkov with the `--\ncreate-baseline` flag. This will generate a `.checkov.baseline` file with all the current findings.\n\n    \n```bash\n    checkov -d . --create-baseline\n    ```\n\n\n2.  **Use the baseline in your\n CI/CD pipeline:** In your pipeline, use the `--baseline` flag to tell checkov to only report findings that\n are *not* in the baseline file.\n\n    \n```bash\n    checkov -d . --baseline .checkov.baseline\n\n    \n```\n\n\n    Your CI/CD pipeline will now only fail if a *new* security issue is introduced.\n\n\n### Best Practices for Production in 2026\n\nHere is a recommended strategy for managing Terraform security exceptions in a\n production environment, looking towards 2026:\n\n1.  **Automate Everything in CI/CD:** Your\n CI/CD pipeline is your primary gatekeeper. Integrate both `tfsec` (or `Trivy`) and\n `checkov` into your pipeline to scan every pull request before it can be merged into your main branch.\n\n2.  **\nUse a Tiered Exception Strategy:**\n    *   **Baseline for Legacy:** For existing, large codebases, use \n`checkov`'s baseline feature to establish an initial set of accepted risks. This allows you to start enforcing security on\n new code without having to fix hundreds of old issues at once.\n    *   **In-Code for New Exceptions\n:** For any *new* exceptions that need to be made, use in-code comments (`tfsec:ignore` or \n`checkov:skip`).\n\n3.  **Enforce an Exception Policy:**\n    *   **Justification is\n Mandatory:** Every in-code exception must include a clear and concise reason for the exception.\n    *   **Expiration Dates\n are Mandatory:** Every `tfsec` ignore should have an expiration date. For `checkov`, you can enforce this through\n pull request reviews. This ensures that exceptions are not forgotten and are periodically reviewed.\n    *   **Auditable Trail\n:** All new exceptions must be introduced via a pull request, so you have a clear audit trail of who requested the exception,\n who approved it, and why.\n\n4.  **Regularly Review Baselines:** Schedule a quarterly or semi-annual\n review of your `checkov` baseline file. The goal should be to gradually reduce the number of exceptions in the baseline over time.\n\n\n5.  **Policy-as-Code (PaC):** For more advanced or custom security policies, especially\n in a complex production environment, consider using Open Policy Agent (OPA). Both `tfsec` and `checkov` can be extended\n with OPA policies, allowing you to write your own custom rules that are specific to your organization's security requirements.\n\nBy combining\n these strategies, you can create a robust and scalable system for managing Terraform security exceptions in production, ensuring that you are only\n accepting known and documented risks, while still allowing for the flexibility needed to manage a real-world production environment in 202\n6.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","timestamp":37542},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":37542},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682576534-df34f5b6e3fbc8","status":"completed","timestamp":37542},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682576547-1157dcff8a617","status":"completed","timestamp":37542},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682576572-02ef279918d3c8","status":"completed","timestamp":37542},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769682576589-d23c618309267","status":"completed","timestamp":37542},{"type":"message","content":"Managing Terraform","timestamp":37542},{"type":"message","content":" security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026 will involve a combination of in","timestamp":37542},{"type":"message","content":"-code annotations for specific exceptions and baseline files for managing a large set of existing findings, all integrated into a robust CI/CD pipeline","timestamp":37542},{"type":"message","content":".

Here are some of the most prominent ones:\n\n### Key Techniques and Trends:\n\n*   **\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):** This has been a major area of focus. Instead of relying on\n a single reward model, RLVR uses an outcome or verifier to assess the correctness of a model's final answer. This ver\nifier can be a simple check, like comparing a numerical answer to a known solution, or a more complex one. This approach\n helps to improve the reliability of the reward signal.\n\n*   **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO):** This algorithm is\n often used in conjunction with RLVR. GRPO is a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that is\n designed to be more efficient for training large language models on reasoning tasks. It works by dropping the \"critic\" (value\n model) from PPO, which reduces memory usage and computational overhead.\n\n*   **Process Reward Models (PRMs):** This\n technique involves providing rewards for each step in the reasoning process, rather than just the final outcome. The idea is to guide\n the model towards a correct line of reasoning. However, PRMs have seen limited success in large-scale reinforcement learning due to the\n significant computational cost they introduce.\n\n*   **Self-Play and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** Techniques like **\nSPIRAL (Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement\n Learning)** are being explored. In this setup, multiple LLM agents interact with each other in a game-like environment\n, which encourages them to develop more sophisticated reasoning abilities.\n\n*   **Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL):\n** This is an approach for performing online reinforcement learning on data that does not have ground-truth labels, such as test\n data. This allows the model to continue learning and adapting even after it has been deployed.\n\n*   **Synthetic Data Generation and\n Data Mixing:** In 2024, a significant trend has been the use of synthetic data to train LLMs for\n reasoning tasks. This involves generating new data, optimizing the mix of different data sources, and using domain-specific data to\n improve performance on particular tasks.\n\n*   **Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RAFT):** RAFT is a simpler\n alternative to reinforcement learning that has shown promising results. It involves generating a large number of possible outputs and then using a ver\nifier to select the correct ones for fine-tuning. This technique has been shown to match or even exceed the performance of more\n complex RL methods on some math reasoning benchmarks.\n\n*   **Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (D\nAPO):** This is an open-source framework designed for large-scale, long-sequence reinforcement learning training of\n LLMs. It provides a more efficient and user-friendly way to apply RL to complex reasoning tasks.\n\nIn summary\n, the field is moving towards more efficient and verifiable methods for applying reinforcement learning to LLM reasoning. While full-scale reinforcement\n learning is still computationally expensive, techniques like RLVR with GRPO, along with simpler methods like RAFT, are showing\n great promise in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models.

Here are the key techniques:\n\n\n### 1. **Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**\n\nThis is the most significant trend.\n Instead of relying on subjective human feedback, RLVR uses automated and verifiable outcomes as reward signals. This is particularly effective for reasoning\n tasks where correctness can be programmatically checked.\n\n*   **Outcome-Based Rewards:** The primary method is to reward the\n LLM only if the final answer is correct. This is used for tasks like solving math problems, writing code that passes unit\n tests, or answering questions with verifiable facts. The **DeepSeek-R1** model is a prime example of this approach\n, using the **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** algorithm.\n*   **Process-Based Rewards:** This\n is a more advanced technique where intermediate reasoning steps are also rewarded. However, research suggests that this approach is still in its early\n stages and can be computationally expensive compared to outcome-based rewards.\n\n### 2. **Synthetic Data Generation and Curriculum\n Learning**\n\nTo train LLMs for complex reasoning, a large and diverse dataset is required. Researchers are increasingly using LL\nMs themselves to generate this data.\n\n*   **Self-Correction and Self-Critique:** An LLM generates a\n problem, attempts to solve it, and then another LLM (or the same one) critiques the solution and provides feedback.\n This feedback is then used to refine the initial solution. This iterative process creates a high-quality dataset of problems and correct\n solutions.\n*   **Curriculum Learning:** The training process starts with simple problems and gradually increases in difficulty. This\n allows the LLM to build a solid foundation of reasoning skills before moving on to more complex tasks. This is often combined\n with synthetic data generation, where the difficulty of the generated problems is controlled.\n\n### 3. **Test-Time\n Reinforcement Learning (TTRL)**\n\nThis technique applies reinforcement learning at inference time, allowing the LLM to adapt to\n the specific problem it is trying to solve.\n\n*   **Entropy-Based Exploration:** TTRL balances exploration and exploitation by\n using an entropy mechanism. This allows the LLM to explore different reasoning paths while still focusing on the most promising ones.\n\n*   **Online RL on Test Data:** TTRL can be used for online reinforcement learning on data without ground\n-truth labels, which is particularly useful for real-world applications where labeled data is scarce.\n\n### 4. **Multi-\nAgent Reinforcement Learning**\n\nThis approach uses a multi-agent setup to improve reasoning.\n\n*   **Self-Play in\n Zero-Sum Games:** As demonstrated in the **SPIRAL** paper, having LLMs compete against each other in zero\n-sum games can incentivize the development of more sophisticated reasoning abilities.\n*   **Collaborative Problem Solving:** Multiple LLMs can\n work together to solve a problem, with each agent contributing its own expertise. This can lead to more robust and accurate solutions.\n\n\n### 5. **Open-Source Frameworks and Libraries**\n\nThe development of open-source frameworks has accelerated\n research in this area.\n\n*   **RLFactory:** A plug-and-play framework for post-training LL\nMs with reinforcement learning.\n*   **TTRL:** An open-source solution for test-time reinforcement learning\n.\n\nIn summary, the trend in 2024 and 2025 is a move away from manual\n, human-in-the-loop data selection towards automated, scalable, and verifiable methods. The focus is on creating\n a virtuous cycle where LLMs generate their own training data, learn from verifiable outcomes, and continuously improve their reasoning abilities through self\n-correction and multi-agent competition.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?","timestamp":22921},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":22921},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769683716320-7df213eac9e73","status":"completed","timestamp":22921},{"type":"message","content":"Based on a review of research in","timestamp":22921},{"type":"message","content":" 2024 and 2025, the latest data selection techniques for enhancing LLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have","timestamp":22921},{"type":"message","content":" moved beyond traditional RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) towards more scalable and automated methods.

Advanced Data Generation and Selection Techniques\n\n*   **Self-Play:** In this approach, the LLM ref\nines its reasoning abilities by generating problems and solutions and then using a reward model to evaluate its own performance.

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RL\nVR)\n\nThe most significant trend is the shift to **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)**.

Process-Based vs. Outcome-Based Rewards\n\nThere is ongoing research into whether to reward the reasoning\n *process* or just the final *outcome*.\n\n*   **Process Reward Models (PRMs):** This technique\n involves rewarding each step in the reasoning chain. While the idea has been around for some time, it has been revisited in\n 2024 and 2025. However, research, including findings from the DeepSeek-R1 paper\n, suggests that the high computational cost of implementing PRMs in large-scale RL can sometimes outweigh their benefits.\n*\n   **Outcome-Based Rewards:** As seen with RLVR, rewarding the final, verifiable outcome is currently a more computationally\n feasible and widely adopted approach.\n\n### 3. Advanced Data Curation and Synthetic Data Generation\n\nIn 202\n4, a significant focus was placed on improving the data used for training.

Emerging Reinforcement Learning Techniques in\n 2025\n\nSeveral novel RL techniques for data selection and model training have emerged in 2025:\n\n\n*   **Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL):** This is an online RL approach that allows models\n to learn from new data without ground-truth labels, even during inference. This is a significant step towards models that can continuously learn\n and adapt.\n*   **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:**\n    *   **SPIRAL (Self-Play on\n Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning):** This technique uses a multi-agent, self-play setup where models\n learn by competing against each other, which helps to improve their reasoning capabilities.\n    *   **MARTI (Multi-Agent\n Reinforced Training and Inference):** A framework for using multiple LLM-based agents to improve training and inference.\n*   \n**Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning:**\n    *   **Logic-RL:** This approach incorporates logical rules into the reinforcement\n learning process to enhance the model's reasoning abilities, making it more robust and interpretable.\n*   **Efficient\n and Scalable RL Frameworks:**\n    *   **DAPO (Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization\n):** An open-source framework designed for large-scale, long-sequence RL training, making it easier to apply\n these advanced techniques to very large models.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend in 2024 and 2025\n for data selection in LLM reasoning has decisively shifted from human-in-the-loop methods like RLHF to more\n automated, scalable, and data-centric approaches.

Retrieval\n-Augmented Generation (RAG) at the Edge\n\nBy 2026, RAG is expected to be a dominant\n pattern for building sophisticated, context-aware AI applications. Cloudflare is well-positioned to support this with its integrated developer\n platform.\n\n*   **How it works:** A user's query, received by a Cloudflare Worker, triggers\n a search in a Vectorize database to retrieve relevant context. This context, along with the original query, is then passed\n to a large language model (LLM) via a Workers AI binding. The LLM uses this information to generate a more\n accurate and relevant response.\n*   **Example:** A documentation site that uses a chatbot to answer user questions.

Real-time, AI-powered Content Personalization\n\nWith AI at the edge, developers\n can personalize content for users in real-time, without introducing significant latency.\n\n*   **How it works:** A Worker\n can use information about a user (such as their location, device, or browsing history) to customize the content of a web\n page.

AI-powered Security and Abuse Detection\n\nCloudflare's security products can be enhanced with AI models\n running at the edge.\n\n*   **How it works:** A Worker can analyze incoming requests and use a Workers AI binding\n to run a fraud detection or content moderation model. This allows for real-time threat detection and response, without sending data\n to a centralized server.\n*   **Example:** A social media platform that uses AI to detect and block spam or abusive\n content as it's being posted.\n\n### 4.

Direct\n AI Model Inference\nThis is the most straightforward pattern. A Cloudflare Worker is bound to a Workers AI model (e\n.g., a large language model for text generation, or an embedding model). The Worker receives a request, invokes the model via\n the binding to perform a specific task, and returns the result.\n\n**Common use-cases:**\n*   **Content\n generation:** Generating product descriptions, social media posts, or email copy.\n*   **Translation:** Translating user-\ngenerated content in real-time.\n*   **Image classification:** Categorizing images uploaded by users.\n\n**Example \n`wrangler.toml` configuration:**\n\n```toml\n[[ai]]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n```\n\n\n###\n 2. AI Gateway for Caching, Rate Limiting, and Analytics\nIn this pattern, a Worker's requests to\n Workers AI are routed through the **AI Gateway**.

A Worker takes a user query, uses a Vectorize binding to search for relevant context in\n a knowledge base, and then passes both the query and the retrieved context to a large language model through a Workers AI binding.\n This allows the model to generate more accurate and context-aware responses.\n\n**Common use-cases:**\n*   \n**AI-powered search:** Building a natural language search engine for a company's documentation.\n*   **Contextual\n chatbots:** Creating a customer support bot that can answer questions based on a company's knowledge base.\n*   **Personal\nized recommendations:** Providing users with recommendations based on their past behavior and preferences.\n\n### 4. Full-Stack AI Applications\n\nThis pattern involves building entire applications on the Cloudflare developer platform. It combines multiple Cloudflare products, with Workers AI and\n bindings at the core of the AI functionality.\n\n**A typical stack might include:**\n*   **Cloudflare Pages\n:** For hosting the frontend of the application.\n*   **Cloudflare Workers:** For the backend logic, routing, and user\n authentication.\n*   **Workers AI:** For the core AI-powered features.\n*   **Vectorize:** For storing\n and retrieving vector embeddings for RAG.\n*   **R2:** For storing images, documents, and other large\n files.\n*   **D1:** For structured data storage.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","timestamp":22386},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":22386},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684498746-888d195c63efa","status":"completed","timestamp":22386},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest","timestamp":22386},{"type":"message","content":" information for 2026, here are some common usage patterns for Cloudflare Workers AI bindings:\n\n### 1.

Advanced Serverless AI Inference at the Edge\nThis is the foundational usage pattern. By binding Workers\n AI in your `wrangler.toml`, you can directly invoke various AI models from your Worker scripts. This allows for\n low-latency, serverless execution of tasks like:\n\n*   **Real-time Text Generation:** Powering chatbots, content\n creation tools, and dynamic API responses.\n*   **Image and Audio Analysis:** Processing user uploads for classification, object\n detection, or audio transcription directly at the edge.\n*   **Data Pre-processing for AI models:** Cleaning and transforming data before\n sending it to more complex models or storing it in a vector database.\n\n### 2. Sophisticated RAG (\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipelines\nWith the maturation of Cloudflare's AI ecosystem, developers will increasingly build\n complex RAG applications. This involves using multiple bindings within a single Worker to:\n\n*   **Connect to Vectorize:**\n A binding to Cloudflare's vector database to retrieve relevant context for a user's query.\n*   **Invoke\n Workers AI:** A binding to a large language model to generate a response based on the retrieved context.\n*   **Integr\nate with AI Gateway:** A binding to the AI Gateway for logging, caching, and analytics of the entire RAG process\n.\n\n### 3. AI Gateway for Cost Control and Observability\nAs AI usage scales, managing costs and understanding\n performance will be critical. The AI Gateway, integrated via a binding, will be a key usage pattern for:\n\n*   \n**Prompt and Response Caching:** Reducing costs by caching the responses to common AI prompts.\n*   **Usage Analytics and\n Token Tracking:** Gaining insights into which AI models are being used most frequently and how many tokens are being consumed.\n*   \n**Unified Billing:** The introduction of unified billing in 2026 will make it easier to manage the costs of third\n-party AI models through the AI Gateway.\n\n### 4. Full-Stack AI-Powered Applications\nDevelopers will leverage the entire\n Cloudflare developer platform to build full-stack AI applications. This will involve using a combination of bindings in their Workers:\n\n*\n   **R2 for Data Storage:** A binding to R2 to store and retrieve user data, training data, or the\n outputs of AI models.\n*   **D1 for Structured Data:** A binding to D1 for storing structured data, such as\n user profiles or application state.\n*   **Pages for Frontend Hosting:** A seamless integration between the frontend hosted on Pages and the\n AI-powered backend running on Workers.\n\n### 5. Conditional AI Logic with Smart Routing\nBy leveraging the routing\n capabilities of Workers, developers can create more intelligent and efficient AI applications. For example, a Worker could be configured to:\n\n\n*   **Selectively Invoke AI Models:** Use a binding to invoke a specific AI model based on the request path or other criteria.\n\n*   **A/B Test Different Models:** Route traffic to different AI models to test their performance and cost-effectiveness.\n\n*   **Fallback Mechanisms:** If a primary AI model fails, the Worker can automatically fall back to a different model or\n a non-AI-powered response.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","timestamp":21969},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":21969},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684530411-e002698effb1a8","status":"completed","timestamp":21969},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the forward-looking information","timestamp":21969},{"type":"message","content":" available, here are some examples of Cloudflare Workers AI binding usage patterns we can expect to see in 2026:","timestamp":21969},{"type":"message","content":"\n\n### 1.

Here’s a tutorial on\n how to do it in 2026.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   Node.js (v18 or\n later)\n*   `pnpm` (recommended), `yarn`, or `npm`\n\n### Step 1\n: Create a Turborepo Monorepo\n\nFirst, create a new Turborepo monorepo. The following\n command will scaffold a new project with a default structure, including `apps` and `packages` directories.\n\n\n```bash\nn\npx create-turbo@latest\n\n```\n\n\nDuring the setup, you will be asked for a project name and which package manager\n you'd like to use.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize shadcn/ui\n\nNavigate into the root of your\n new monorepo and initialize shadcn/ui using its CLI.\n\n\n```bash\ncd your-monorepo\n-name\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init\n\n```\n\n\nThe shadcn/ui CLI will detect\n that you are in a monorepo and ask you a few questions. Here’s how you should answer them:\n\n\n*   **Which style would you like to use?** `Default`\n*   **Which color would you like to\n use as base color?** `Slate`\n*   **Where is your global CSS file?** `apps/web/\napp/globals.css` (or the equivalent for your main application)\n*   **Would you like to use CSS\n variables for colors?** `Yes`\n*   **Are you using a custom tailwind prefix?** `No\n`\n*   **Where is your tailwind.config.js located?** `packages/ui/tailwind.config\n.js`\n*   **Configure import alias for components?** `Yes`\n*   **Where are your components\n located?** `packages/ui/src/components`\n*   **Configure import alias for utils?** `Yes\n`\n*   **Write configuration to components.json.** `Yes`\n\nThis will create a `packages/ui\n` directory for your shared components and configure Tailwind CSS.\n\n### Step 3: Add Components to Your UI Package\n\nNow you\n can add shadcn/ui components to your shared `ui` package. Run the `add` command from the root of your mon\norepo:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button\n```\n\n\nThis will add the \n`Button` component to `packages/ui/src/components`.\n\n### Step 4: Use Shared Components in Your Application\n\n\nYou can now import and use the shared components in any of your applications. For example, to use the `Button` component\n in your `web` app, open a page file (e.g., `apps/web/app/page\n.tsx`) and add the following:\n\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/button\";\n\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Web</h1>\n      <Button>Click\n me</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Step 5: Start the Development Server\n\n\nFrom the root of your monorepo, run the development server:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dev\n```\n\n\nThis\n will start the development server for your `web` application, and you should see the button rendered on the page.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou now have a fully functional Turborepo setup with a shared shadcn/ui component library.

Here’s a tutorial on how to achieve this in 2026.\n\n### \n1. Create a new Turborepo\n\nStart by creating a new Turborepo monorepo using the following command:\n\n\n\n```bash\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n```\n\n\nFollow the prompts to configure your new monorepo.\n\n\n### 2. Create a UI package\n\nCreate a new package in your monorepo for your shared shadcn UI components.\n You can do this by creating a new directory under the `packages` folder.\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/ui\n\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS in the UI package\n\nNavigate to your new UI package and\n initialize a `package.json` file.\n\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm init\n```\n\n\nInstall Tailwind\n CSS and its peer dependencies:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\npnpm add -\nD @types/react react\n\n```\n\n\nCreate a `postcss.config.js` file:\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule\n.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n};\n\n\n```\n\n\nCreate a `tailwind.config.js` file. This will be a base configuration that can be extended by\n the applications in your monorepo.\n\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule\n.exports = {\n  content: [\n    \"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx\n}\",\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n};\n\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Install shadcn UI\n\nRun the shadcn UI `init` command in the root\n of your monorepo:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init\n```\n\n\nThis command will\n prompt you for configuration options. When asked for the path to your `tailwind.config.js` file, provide the path\n to the one in your UI package (`packages/ui/tailwind.config.js`).\n\n### 5. Configure\n your application\n\nNow, configure your application (e.g., a Next.js app in the `apps/web` directory)\n to use the shared UI package.\n\nFirst, add the UI package as a dependency to your application's `package.\njson`:\n\n\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"ui\": \"workspace:*\"\n}\n```\n\n\nNext\n, update your application's `tailwind.config.js` to import the configuration from the UI package:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst sharedConfig = require(\"ui/tailwind.config.js\");\n\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config\n} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  presets: [sharedConfig],\n  content: [\n    './app\n/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx\n,mdx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    '\n../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n  ],\n  ...\n};\n\n\n```\n\n\n### 6. Add components\n\nYou can now add shadcn UI components to your UI package from the\n root of your monorepo:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button\n```\n\n\nWhen\n prompted, confirm that you want to add the component to the `packages/ui` directory.\n\n### 7.\n Use the components in your application\n\nFinally, you can import and use the components from the `ui` package in your application:\n\n\n```jsx\nimport { Button } from \"ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  \nreturn (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My App</h1>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </div>\n  \n);\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThis setup allows you to maintain a single source of truth for your UI components and styles, which\n can be shared across all applications in your Turborepo.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":22142},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":22142},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684736579-0f51961f2c6d28","status":"completed","timestamp":22142},{"type":"message","content":"Setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo allows you to share UI components across","timestamp":22142},{"type":"message","content":" multiple applications efficiently.

Create a new Turborepo\n\n\nFirst, create a new Turborepo project with Tailwind CSS pre-configured. Open your terminal and run the following command\n:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\n\nThis will prompt\n you for a project name and set up a new monorepo with a `web` and a `docs` app\n, as well as a shared `ui` package.\n\n### 2. Configure the UI package\n\nNavigate to the `packages\n/ui` directory. This is where you will configure shadcn/ui.\n\n#### a. Modify `tsconfig.json`\n\n\nOpen `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` and add the following `compilerOptions` to enable path aliases:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@repo/typescript-config/react-library.json\",\n  \"\ncompilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \n\"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src\"],\n  \"\nexclude\": [\"node_modules\", \"dist\"]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n#### b. Create and configure `components.\njson`\n\nCreate a new file named `components.json` in the `packages/ui` directory:\n\n\n```bash\n\ncd packages/ui\ntouch components.json\n\n```\n\n\nAdd the following configuration to `packages/ui/components\n.json`. This file tells the shadcn/ui CLI where to find your configuration files and how to set up your\n components.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.js\",\n    \"css\": \"src\n/styles.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"\niconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\n\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \n\"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n#### c. Install dependencies\n\nInstall the necessary dependencies in\n the `ui` package:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge luc\nide-react tw-animate-css\n\n```\n\n\n#### d. Create the `cn` utility function\n\nCreate a new file at\n `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts` and add the following code. This utility function is used to merge\n Tailwind CSS classes.\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { tw\nMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(cls\nx(inputs));\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Set up `tsup` for building the UI package\n\n\nBy default, the `ui` package is built using `tsc`. To properly handle path aliases, you will use `ts\nup` to build the package.\n\n#### a. Install `tsup`\n\nInstall `tsup` as a dev\n dependency in the `ui` package:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n\n#### b.\n Create `tsup.config.ts`\n\nCreate a `tsup.config.ts` file in the `packages/\nui` directory:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry\n: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\n\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  external:\n [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n\n```\n\n\n#### c\n. Update `package.json` scripts\n\nOpen `packages/ui/package.json` and update the `scripts\n` section to use `tsup`:\n\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build\": \"tsup\",\n  \n\"dev\": \"tsup --watch\",\n  \"lint\": \"eslint . --max-warnings 0\",\n  \n\"clean\": \"rm -rf .turbo && rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf dist\"\n},\n\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Export and use components\n\n#### a. Add exports to `package.json`\n\n\nOpen `packages/ui/package.json` and add the following `exports` field to make the components and styles available to other\n packages in the monorepo:\n\n\n```json\n\"exports\": {\n  \"./styles.css\": \"./dist/index\n.css\",\n  \"./*\": \"./dist/*.mjs\",\n  \"./shadcn/ui/*\": \"./dist/\ncomponents/ui/*.mjs\",\n  \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/lib/*.mjs\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\n####\n b. Add shadcn/ui components\n\nNow you can add shadcn/ui components to your `ui` package\n. Run the following command from the `packages/ui` directory:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@\nlatest add button\n\n```\n\n\nThis will add the `button` component to `packages/ui/src/components/\nui`.\n\n#### c. Use components in your app\n\nNow you can import and use the components in your `web\n` app. For example, to use the `Button` component in `apps/web/app/page.tsx`:\n\n\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button\";\n\nexport default function Page\n() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Web</h1>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    \n</div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\nYou also need to import the stylesheet in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx\n`:\n\n\n```tsx\nimport \"@repo/ui/styles.css\";\nimport type { Metadata } from \"next\";\n\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\nimport \"./globals.css\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n subsets: [\"latin\"] });\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: \"Create Turborepo\",\n\n  description: \"Generated by create turbo\",\n};\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}:\n {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}): JSX.Element {\n  return (\n    <html\n lang=\"en\">\n      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 5. Troubleshooting\n\n-   **Error: Cannot find module `@/lib/utils`**: This error usually\n occurs when path aliases are not configured correctly or `tsup` is not set up properly.

Here’s a tutorial on how to do it, based on the latest practices in 2026\n.\n\n### 1. Create a new Turborepo monorepo\n\nFirst, create a new Turborepo project\n. Open your terminal and run the following command:\n\n\n```bash\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n```\n\n\n\nFollow the prompts to create your new monorepo. For this tutorial, let's assume you chose `pnpm\n` as your package manager.\n\n### 2. Create a shared UI package\n\nThe standard practice is to place your shared UI components in\n a dedicated package within the `packages` directory.\n\n1.  **Create a `ui` package:** If it doesn'\nt exist already, create a new directory named `ui` inside the `packages` directory.\n\n2.  **Add\n a `package.json` file:** Create a `package.json` file inside `packages/ui` with the following content\n:\n\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n      \"version\": \"0.0\n.0\",\n      \"private\": true,\n      \"exports\": {\n        \"./globals.css\": \"./src\n/styles/globals.css\",\n        \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.mjs\",\n        \n\"./tailwind.config\": \"./tailwind.config.ts\",\n        \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*\",\n\n        \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*\"\n      },\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"\nlint\": \"eslint . --max-warnings 0\"\n      },\n      \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"@repo\n/eslint-config\": \"*\",\n        \"@repo/typescript-config\": \"*\",\n        \"@types/node\":\n \"^20.11.24\",\n        \"@types/react\": \"^18.2.6\n1\",\n        \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18.2.19\",\n        \"autoprefixer\n\": \"^10.4.18\",\n        \"eslint\": \"^8.57.0\",\n        \"\npostcss\": \"^8.4.35\",\n        \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.1\",\n        \"\ntypescript\": \"^5.3.3\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### 3. Configure\n Tailwind CSS\n\nSince shadcn/ui is built on top of Tailwind CSS, you need to configure it for your `ui\n` package.\n\n1.  **Create `postcss.config.mjs`:** In `packages/ui`, create a \n`postcss.config.mjs` file:\n\n    \n```javascript\n    const config = {\n      plugins: {\n\n        tailwindcss: {},\n        autoprefixer: {},\n      },\n    };\n\n    export default config;\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Create `tailwind.config.ts`:** In `packages/ui`, create a `tailwind\n.config.ts` file. This will be your base Tailwind configuration.\n\n    \n```typescript\n    import type { Config } from\n \"tailwindcss\";\n\n    const config: Omit<Config, \"content\"> = {\n      theme: {\n        extend:\n {},\n      },\n      plugins: [require(\"tailwindcss-animate\")],\n    };\n\n    export default config;\n\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Create a shared `globals.css`:** Inside `packages/ui/src/styles\n`, create a `globals.css` file with the base Tailwind directives and CSS variables for themes.\n\n    \n```css\n\n    @tailwind base;\n    @tailwind components;\n    @tailwind utilities;\n\n    @layer base {\n\n      :root {\n        --background: 0 0% 100%;\n        --foreground: 2\n22.2 84% 4.9%;\n        /* ... other css variables */\n      }\n\n      .dark {\n        --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;\n        --\nforeground: 210 40% 98%;\n        /* ... other dark theme css variables */\n\n      }\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### 4. Initialize shadcn/ui in your application\n\nNow, you\n need to configure one of your applications (e.g., `web`) to use the shared UI package.\n\n1.  \n**Install dependencies in the app:** In your `apps/web` directory, install the necessary dependencies:\n\n    \n```bash\n    pnpm add tailwindcss-animate class-variance-authority clsx lucide-react tailwind-\nmerge\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Configure the app's Tailwind CSS:** Update the `tailwind.config.ts` in\n `apps/web` to import the configuration from your `ui` package and correctly resolve paths.\n\n    \n```typescript\n    import\n type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\n    import sharedConfig from \"@repo/ui/tailwind.config\";\n\n    const config\n: Pick<Config, \"content\" | \"presets\"> = {\n      content: [\n        \"./src/**/*.tsx\n\",\n        \"../../packages/ui/src/components/**/*.tsx\",\n      ],\n      presets: [shared\nConfig],\n    };\n\n    export default config;\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Initialize shadcn/ui:**\n Run the shadcn/ui `init` command from the root of your monorepo.\n\n    \n```bash\n\n    pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init\n    \n```\n\n\n    When prompted, provide the following configuration\n:\n\n    *   **Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)?** `yes`\n    *   **Which\n style would you like to use?** `Default`\n    *   **Which color would you like to use as base\n color?** `Slate`\n    *   **Where is your global CSS file?** `packages/ui/src\n/styles/globals.css`\n    *   **Do you want to use CSS variables for colors?** `yes\n`\n    *   **Where is your tailwind.config.js located?** `apps/web/tailwind\n.config.ts`\n    *   **Configure import alias for components:** `@/components`\n    *   **Configure\n import alias for utils:** `@/lib/utils`\n    *   **Are you using React Server Components?** \n`yes`\n    *   **Write configuration to `components.json`.** `yes`\n\n    This will create a `components\n.json` file in your `apps/web` directory.\n\n4.  **Move `components.json\n` and `lib/`:** Move the `components.json` file and the `lib/` directory from `apps/web\n` to the `packages/ui` directory.\n\n5.  **Update `components.json`:** Open `packages/ui\n/components.json` and update the paths:\n\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"$schema\": \"https://ui\n.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n      \"style\": \"default\",\n      \"rsc\": true\n,\n      \"tsx\": true,\n      \"tailwind\": {\n        \"config\": \"tailwind.config.\nts\",\n        \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n        \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n        \n\"cssVariables\": true\n      },\n      \"aliases\": {\n        \"components\": \"@/components\",\n        \"utils\n\": \"@/lib/utils\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### 5. Add a component\n\n\nNow you can add shadcn/ui components to your shared `ui` package.\n\nFrom the root of your monorepo,\n run the `add` command:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button --path\n packages/ui/src\n\n```\n\n\nThis will add the `Button` component to your `packages/ui/src/components\n` directory.\n\n### 6. Use the shared component in your app\n\nFinally, you can use the shared component\n in your `web` application.\n\n\n```tsx\n// in apps/web/src/app/page.tsx\n\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  \nreturn (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Web</h1>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\nThis setup allows you to maintain a single source of truth for your UI components and styles, and easily share\n them across all applications in your Turborepo monorepo.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":29978},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":29978},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684827508-fe0109756fbab","status":"completed","timestamp":29978},{"type":"message","content":"Setting up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo allows you to share UI components across multiple","timestamp":29978},{"type":"message","content":" applications efficiently.

Create a new Turbore\npo\n\nStart by creating a new Turborepo monorepo using the following command.\n\n\n```bash\nnpx create-turbo\n@latest\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Create a UI package\n\nIt's recommended to place your UI components in a separate\n package so they can be shared across all the applications in your monorepo.\n\nYou can create a new `ui` package by\n running the following command at the root of your monorepo:\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/ui\n```\n\n\nNext\n, create a `package.json` file inside the `packages/ui` directory with the following content:\n\n\n```json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./tailwind.config\": \"./tailwind.config.js\",\n\n    \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.js\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \n\"lint\": \"eslint . --max-warnings 0\",\n    \"generate:component\": \"turbo gen react\n-component\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@repo/eslint-config\": \"*\",\n    \"@\nrepo/typescript-config\": \"*\",\n    \"@turbo/gen\": \"^1.12.4\",\n    \"@\ntypes/node\": \"^20.11.24\",\n    \"@types/eslint\": \"^8.\n56.5\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18.2.61\",\n    \"@\ntypes/react-dom\": \"^18.2.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8.5\n7.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18.2.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.3\n.3\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS\n\nEach application in your monorepo\n that consumes components from the `ui` package must have its own `tailwind.config.js` file. However, you\n can share the Tailwind CSS configuration from the `ui` package.\n\nFirst, install the necessary dependencies in the `ui\n` package:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @repo/ui\n```\n\n\nNext, create\n a `tailwind.config.js` file in the `packages/ui` directory with the following content:\n\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  darkMode: [\"\nclass\"],\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx\n}',\n    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n  ],\n\n  theme: {\n    // ...\n  },\n  plugins: [require(\"tailwindcss-animate\")],\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\nNow, in each of your applications, you can import the shared Tailwind CSS configuration. For example, in\n `apps/web/tailwind.config.js`:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst sharedConfig = require(\"@repo/ui\n/tailwind.config\");\n\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  ...sharedConfig,\n  content: [\n    // ... paths to your app's files\n  ],\n};\n\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Initialize shadcn/ui\n\nNow you are ready to initialize shadcn/ui.\n In the root of your monorepo, run the following command:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-\nui@latest init\n\n```\n\n\nThe CLI will ask you a few questions to configure `components.json`:\n\n-\n   **Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)?** `yes`\n-   **Which style would you like to\n use?** `Default`\n-   **Which color would you like to use as base color?** `Slate\n`\n-   **Where is your global CSS file?** `apps/web/src/globals.css`\n\n-   **Would you like to use CSS variables for colors?** `yes`\n-   **Where is your\n Tailwind config located?** `packages/ui/tailwind.config.js`\n-   **Configure the import alias\n for components:** `@/components`\n-   **Configure the import alias for utils:** `@/lib/utils`\n\n-   **Are you using React Server Components?** `yes`\n-   **Write configuration to `components.json`.\n**\n\n### 5. Add a component\n\nNow you can add shadcn/ui components to your `ui` package.\n Run the following command from the root of your monorepo:\n\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@\nlatest add button -p packages/ui\n\n```\n\n\nThis will add the `Button` component to the `packages/ui\n` directory.\n\n### 6. Use the component in your application\n\nFinally, you can use the shared component in your application.\n For example, in `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`:\n\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button\n } from \"@repo/ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    \n<main>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n\n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":37153},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":37153},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769684869084-37b4687454c958","status":"completed","timestamp":37153},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":37153},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769684882227-6abd415d1a8f7","status":"completed","timestamp":37153},{"type":"message","content":"Here is a tutorial on how to set","timestamp":37153},{"type":"message","content":" up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo:\n\n### 1.

Embrace the Shift to ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):**\nWhile traditional ETL is\n still relevant, the ELT pattern is gaining prominence. In ELT, you first load raw data into a cloud data warehouse and\n then transform it. This approach offers greater flexibility, as the raw data is preserved and can be used for multiple purposes.\n It also leverages the power of modern cloud data warehouses for scalable transformations.\n\n**2. Adopt Modern Orchestration and Automation\n:**\nTools like Dagster, Airflow, and Prefect are becoming standard for orchestrating complex data workflows. Best\n practices include:\n*   **CI/CD for Data Pipelines:** Implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)\n practices to automate the testing and deployment of your data pipelines.\n*   **Dynamic and Metadata-Driven Pipelines:** Building\n pipelines that are dynamic and can be configured through metadata, making them more flexible and easier to manage.\n\n**3. Prioritize Data\n Quality and Governance:**\n*   **Integrated Data Quality Testing:** Integrating data quality checks directly into your pipelines using tools like\n Great Expectations.\n*   **Data Governance and Metadata Management:** Establishing strong data governance practices and maintaining a metadata repository to ensure data is\n discoverable, understandable, and trustworthy.\n*   **Data Masking and Compliance:** Implementing data masking for sensitive data to ensure\n compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\n\n**4. Leverage AI and Machine Learning:**\nAI-driven automation is a\n significant trend. This includes using AI for:\n*   **Predictive Optimization:** AI can be used to predict and\n prevent pipeline failures.\n*   **Advanced Transformations:** AI and machine learning models can be integrated into pipelines to perform more\n complex data transformations and enrichment.\n\n**5. Build for Scalability and Resilience with Cloud-Native Architectures:**\n\n*   **Cloud-Native Design:** Design pipelines to be cloud-native, taking advantage of the scalability and elasticity of cloud platforms\n.\n*   **Observability:** Build observability into your pipelines from the start. This means implementing robust logging, monitoring, and\n alerting to ensure you can quickly detect and diagnose issues.\n*   **Modular Architecture:** Adopt a modular \"microservices-\nstyle\" architecture for your data pipelines to improve maintainability and scalability.\n\n**6.

Architectural\n Shift: ELT and Data Mesh\n*   **Embrace ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):** The\n dominant trend is to move away from traditional ETL. In an ELT model, you first load raw data into a cloud\n data warehouse or data lake (like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift) and then perform transformations using tools like d\nbt. This approach offers greater flexibility, preserves raw data for future use, and democratizes data access.\n*   **\nConsider a Data Mesh Architecture:** For larger organizations, a decentralized \"Data Mesh\" is gaining traction. This approach treats data as a product\n, with domain-specific teams owning their data pipelines. This reduces bottlenecks associated with centralized data teams and improves scalability and data ownership\n.\n\n### 2. Data Quality and Governance\n*   **Automated Data Quality Testing:** Integrate automated data quality checks directly\n into your pipelines. Tools like Great Expectations allow you to define data assertions and validate data at each stage.\n*   **\nStrong Metadata Management:** Maintain a data catalog with rich metadata. This improves data discovery, understanding, and trust.\n*   \n**Data Lineage:** Track the flow of data from source to destination. This is crucial for debugging, impact analysis,\n and regulatory compliance.\n\n### 3. Modern Orchestration and Automation\n*   **Use Modern Workflow Orchestrators:** Tools\n like Dagster, Prefect, and Airflow are essential for managing complex dependencies, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines. They provide\n features like automatic retries, SLA tracking, and dynamic pipeline generation.\n*   **Embrace CI/CD for Data Pipelines (\nDataOps):** Apply software engineering best practices to your data pipelines. Use version control (e.g., Git) for your transformation\n code and automate testing and deployment (CI/CD) to ensure reliability and consistency.\n\n### 4. Performance and Scalability\n\n*   **Design for Incremental Loads:** Whenever possible, process data incrementally rather than performing full table scans. This significantly\n reduces processing time and cost.\n*   **Leverage Cloud-Native Services:** Utilize the scalability of cloud platforms.\n Use serverless functions and auto-scaling services to handle variable data volumes efficiently.\n*   **Optimize Transformations:** Use SQL-\nbased transformations where possible, as they are often more performant than row-by-row processing in Python or other languages.\n\n\n### 5. Security and Compliance\n*   **End-to-End Encryption:** Ensure data is encrypted at rest and\n in transit throughout the entire ETL/ELT process.\n*   **Access Control:** Implement the principle of least privilege\n. Grant users and services access only to the data they absolutely need.\n*   **Compliance:** Be aware of data\n privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Design your pipelines to handle data masking, anonymization, and deletion requests.\n\n### \n6. Observability and Monitoring\n*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Implement structured logging to capture key events and metrics from your\n pipelines.\n*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Use monitoring tools to track pipeline performance, data freshness, and data\n quality. Set up alerts to be notified of failures or anomalies.\n\nBy adopting these best practices, you can build modern\n, reliable, and scalable data pipelines that provide timely and trustworthy data for your organization.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025?","timestamp":21785},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":21785},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769685043233-389b9a9fff2fb","status":"completed","timestamp":21785},{"type":"message","content":"Based on industry analysis and","timestamp":21785},{"type":"message","content":" trends from late 2025, here are the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines:\n\n### 1.

AI驱动的“个性化数据资产”锁定 (\nAI-Powered Personalization Lock-in)\n\n这可能是未来最强大的壁垒，它完美结合了锁定效应\n和路径依赖。\n\n*   **构建方式:**\n    1.  **产品/服务的设计核心是“学习\n”。** 你的产品不是一个静态工具，而是一个能通过与用户互动，持续学习并变得越来越“\n懂”用户的AI系统。例如，AI驱动的教育平台、企业CRM、个人健康助手、内容推荐引擎等。\n\n    2.  **创造独有的“私域数据”。** 用户在使用过程中，会持续不断地喂给\n系统大量的、独特的个人偏好、行为模式、工作流等数据。这些数据是竞争对手无法获取的。\n    \n3.  **将数据转化为体验。** AI利用这些私域数据，提供高度个性化的服务。例如，CRM\n系统能自动预测销售线索的成功率并给出建议；教育平台能为每个学生规划独一无二的学习\n路径。\n\n*   **壁垒形成:**\n    *   **锁定效应:** 用户更换产品的**转换成本极\n高**。因为他们失去的不仅仅是一个软件，更是那个已经过长期“训练”、深度了解自己需求和习惯的“\n专属AI助手”。新产品需要很长时间才能达到同等的默契度。\n    *   **路径依赖:** 你\n比竞争对手**更早开始积累**这种个性化数据。你的AI模型因为有了更长时间、更大量的\n专属数据训练，会比后来者更精准、更智能。这种由时间积累带来的数据质量和模型精度的优势\n，是砸钱也无法在短期内弥补的。\n\n#### 2. “嵌入式工作流”锁定\n (Embedded Workflow Lock-in)\n\n将你的产品深度嵌入到客户（尤其是B端客户）的核心工作流程中，\n成为他们“肌肉记忆”的一部分。\n\n*   **构建方式:**\n    1.  **从单一工具到“\n解决方案套件”。** 不要只卖一个SaaS软件，而是提供一套能打通企业内部多个环节（如\nSalesforce打通销售、营销、服务）的解决方案。\n    2.  **开放API，打造生态平台\n。** 鼓励第三方开发者基于你的平台开发应用，进一步将你的系统与客户的其他工具（如ERP、\n财务软件）深度集成。\n    3.  **用AI自动化和优化流程。** 你的系统不仅仅\n是记录数据，更能基于数据自动优化客户的工作流，比如自动化的采购审批、智能的库存管理等\n。\n\n*   **壁垒形成:**\n    *   **锁定效应:** **转换成本是灾难性的**。\n更换系统意味着企业需要重塑整个工作流程、重新培训所有员工、并承担巨大的业务中断风险。\n    \n*   **路径依赖:** 企业一旦围绕你的系统构建了其内部流程和组织架构，未来所有的数字化决策\n都会优先考虑与你的系统兼容。这就形成了一条“技术路径”，企业会沿着这条路一直走下去。\n\n\n#### 3. “开发者/创作者生态”锁定 (Developer/Creator Ecosystem Lock-in)\n\n不要自己\n做所有事，而是打造一个平台，让成千上万的开发者或内容创作者为你构建价值，\n从而锁定他们和最终用户。\n\n*   **构建方式:**\n    1.  **提供独特且强大的“\n生产力工具”。** 例如，提供比竞争对手更易用、功能更强大的AI模型API、游戏开发\n引擎（如Unreal Engine）、或低代码开发平台。\n    2.  **建立公平且有利可图的商业\n模式。** 确保平台上的开发者/创作者能赚到钱（如苹果App Store的分成模式）。\n\n    3.  **投资社区和学习资源。** 投入资源建立活跃的开发者社区、提供详细的文档\n和教程，降低学习曲线。\n\n*   **壁垒形成:**\n    *   **锁定效应:**\n        *\n   **对开发者/创作者:** 他们投入了大量时间学习你的专有技术和API，他们的代码、技能\n、甚至个人品牌都与你的平台深度绑定，转换成本极高。\n        *   **对用户:** 用户\n被平台上丰富独特的应用或内容所吸引，即使竞争对手的平台本身更好，但只要内容生态不繁\n荣，用户就不会迁移。\n    *   **路径依赖:** 一个繁荣的生态一旦形成，就会产生\n网络效应，吸引更多开发者加入，从而创造更多内容，再吸引更多用户，形成一个难以逆转的良\n性循环。后来者很难打破这个循环。\n\n#### 4. “专有数据飞轮”锁定 (Prop\nrietary Data Flywheel Lock-in)\n\n通过产品或服务获取在其他任何地方都无法获得的专有数据，\n并用这些数据来改进产品，从而吸引更多用户，获取更多数据。\n\n*   **构建方式:**\n\n    1.  **找到一个能产生独特数据的场景。** 例如，特斯拉通过汽车传感器收集真实的道路驾驶数据；\nGoogle通过搜索引擎获取用户的查询意图数据。\n    2.  **设计一个“数据交换”的价值主\n张。** 用户愿意“用”数据来换取更好的产品体验（更安全的自动驾驶、更精准的搜索结果）。\n\n    3.  **将数据处理能力作为核心竞争力。** 建立强大的数据基础设施和算法能力，高效\n地将原始数据转化为产品优势。\n\n*   **壁垒形成:**\n    *   **锁定效应:** 用户被\n由海量数据驱动的卓越产品体验所吸引。例如，Waze的用户越多，路况信息就越准\n，就越能吸引新用户，老用户也越不会离开。\n    *   **路径依赖:** 这是\n最纯粹的路径依赖。数据优势随时间累积。一个新公司即使技术更先进，但没有持续\n数年累积的海量专有数据，就无法在产品核心体验上进行竞争。\n\n### 总结\n\n\n到2026年，构建终极竞争壁垒的关键在于：**将你的业务从提供一个“\n产品”转变为运营一个“系统”**。这个系统必须具备以下特征：\n\n*   **学习性\n:** 系统能随用户的增多和使用时间的增长而变得更智能、更具价值。\n*   **\n整合性:** 系统能深度融入用户的个人生活或企业的工作流程。\n*   **生态性:** 能吸引外部\n力量（开发者、合作伙伴）共同创造价值。\n\n通过这四种战略，你可以创造出强大的锁定效应和路径\n依赖，让你的竞争优势不再依赖于某个单一功能，而是根植于整个系统的结构和历史积累之中，从而\n让竞争对手难以望其项背。","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\n2026年如何通过锁定效应 lock-in effect 和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"好的，这是一个非常有深度和前瞻性的战略","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"问题。要在2026年利用“锁定效应（Lock-in Effect）”和“路径依赖（Path Dependency","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"）”构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒，核心思想不再是单一的产品或功能优势，而是构建一个**“","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"正反馈、自增强”的系统**。\n\n随着AI、大数据和生态系统模式的成熟，这两者的","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"结合将变得空前强大。以下是几种在2026年极具潜力的战略构建方式：\n\n---","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"\n\n### 首先，我们快速回顾这两个概念的核心：\n\n*   **锁定效应 (Lock-in Effect):**","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":" 指用户一旦选择了某项技术、产品或服务，由于高昂的**转换成本**（资金、时间","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"、学习、数据迁移、心理等），很难再转向其他竞争对手。目标是“让用户离不开你”。","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"\n*   **路径依赖 (Path Dependency):** 指一旦进入某个“路径”，惯性和过往的积累","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"会使其不断自我强化，即使有更好的选择，也很难偏离。它强调**“时间”和“积累","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"”**的价值，先发优势会随着时间滚雪球式地增长。\n\n---\n\n### 2026","timestamp":39234},{"type":"message","content":"年构建竞争壁垒的四大战略：\n\n#### 1.

和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？\n好的，这是一个非常有深度和前瞻\n性的战略问题。在2026年，技术、用户行为和市场环境将持续演进，利用\n“锁定效应（Lock-in Effect）”和“路径依赖（Path Dependency）”构建竞争壁垒，\n核心在于**深度整合、生态构建和标准制定**。\n\n以下是如何在2026年运用这两个\n概念构建强大护城河的策略：\n\n### 1. 利用“锁定效应”构建高转换成本的\n壁垒\n\n锁定效应的核心是让用户或客户在选择或迁移到竞争对手的产品/服务时，面临\n显著的成本、时间、风险或不便，从而“锁定”在你的体系内。\n\n**2026年的\n策略：**\n\n*   **构建数据驱动的个性化系统 (Data Lock-in):**\n    *\n   **深度个性化:** 利用 AI 大模型，不仅仅是推荐内容（如 Netflix 或 Spotify），而是创造深度\n个性化的用户体验。例如，一个 AI 健身应用，不仅记录你的运动数据，还能根据你的体征\n、习惯、目标动态生成独一无二的训练和营养计划。用户积累的数据越多，AI 对其\n“理解”越深，迁移到新应用意味着从零开始，体验将大幅下降。\n    *   **企业\n级 AI 解决方案:** 对于企业客户，提供能深度学习其内部数据、工作流和业务逻辑的 AI\n 服务。一旦企业的数据和流程与你的 AI 模型深度耦合，更换供应商将意味着巨大的数据迁移成本、员工\n重新培训成本和业务中断风险。\n\n*   **打造无缝集成的生态系统 (Ecosystem Lock-in\n):**\n    *   **超越“全家桶”:** 苹果是经典案例，但2026年的\n生态锁定将更加智能化和无感化。想象一下，你的智能汽车、家居、个人设备和办公软件都由\n一个统一的操作系统或 AI 助手驱动。它们之间的数据和指令无缝流转。例如，你在车\n上开会，会议纪要会自动同步到你的办公软件，并根据内容为你生成待办事项。离开\n这个生态，你失去的不仅是产品，而是一种高效、自动化的生活/工作方式。\n    *   **\n开放平台与 API 锁定:** 建立一个强大的开发者平台（PaaS/SaaS），让成千上万的\n第三方应用和服务基于你的平台构建。这会形成强大的网络效应。企业客户不仅使用了你的核心服务，还依赖\n于生态中的各种应用。要迁移，就等于要放弃整个解决方案，成本极高。\n\n*   **设立\n新的学习和使用习惯 (Habit & Skill Lock-in):**\n    *   **高技能门槛的专业\n工具:** 类似

1. 新的锁定效应：从“功能闭环”到“数据飞轮”\n\n\n过去的锁定效应强调构建一个功能完整、让用户无需离开的“完美闭环”生态。但在2026\n年，这种模式过于笨重，迭代速度跟不上市场变化。新的锁定效应核心是构建一个以数据为中心的\n、能自我增强的“飞轮”。\n\n**核心观点：**

和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？\n好的\n，这是一个非常深刻的商业战略问题。在2026年的商业环境中\n，单纯依靠技术或产品优势已经很难维持长期的竞争力。结合“锁定效应”和“路径依赖”来\n构建竞争壁垒，是一种更系统、更持久的战略。\n\n以下是如何在2026年及\n未来，通过这两个概念构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒的详细策略：\n\n### 一、 深入理解核心\n概念\n\n1.  **锁定效应 (Lock-in Effect)**：让用户一旦选择了你的产品或服务，转换\n到竞争对手的成本变得非常高，以至于他们“宁愿忍受”也不愿离开。这种成本不\n一定是金钱，也可以是时间、精力、学习成本、数据迁移成本或心理依赖。\n2.  **路径依赖\n (Path Dependency)**：指一个系统或组织一旦进入某个路径，就会因为规模经济、学习效应、协调\n效应和历史惯性等因素，不断自我强化，并锁定在该路径上。早期的微小优势或偶然\n选择，会随着时间的推移被放大，形成后来者难以逾越的障碍。\n\n### 二、 构建\n“锁定效应”的现代策略\n\n在2026年，关键在于利用数据、AI和生态系统来制造\n新的锁定形式。\n\n1.  **数据锁定 (Data Lock-in)**：\n    *   **策略\n**：设计一个能持续积累用户个人或企业核心数据的系统。用户在你平台上的数据越多，价值越大，迁移\n就越痛苦。\n    *   **2026年实践**：\n        *   **AI个性\n化引擎**：你的服务（如推荐系统、智能助手、内容生成工具）通过持续学习用户数据而\n变得越来越“懂你”。用户切换到新平台，等于放弃了一个已经高度定制化的“私人助理”。\n        \n*   **企业级数据资产**：对于B端客户，让你的平台成为他们运营数据的“单一事实\n来源”（Single Source of Truth）。例如，一个集成了CRM、ERP和项目管理的云平台，企业的所有流程\n数据都在上面，更换平台的成本是灾难性的。\n\n2.  **生态系统锁定 (Ecosystem Lock-\nin)**：\n    *   **策略**：从单一产品竞争转向生态系统竞争。让你的核心产品成为\n一个平台，连接不同的硬件、软件和服务，形成一个协同工作的网络。\n    *   **2026年\n实践**：\n        *   **软硬件一体化**：像苹果（Apple）一样，通过硬件（\niPhone, Mac, Watch）和软件（iOS, iCloud）的无缝协作创造极致体验。用户购买的\n不仅是一个设备，而是一整套生活和工作方式的“入场券”。\n        *   **平台与\nAPI开放**：像亚马逊云（AWS）或Salesforce一样，打造一个强大的底层平台，并开放API\n吸引成千上万的开发者和第三方服务商。客户不仅使用了你的服务，还依赖于建立在你生态\n之上的无数个第三方应用。\n\n3.  **学习与习惯锁定 (Learning & Habit Lock-in)**：\n    \n*   **策略**：设计具有一定学习曲线但功能强大的产品，一旦用户熟练掌握，就不会轻易更换\n。\n    *   **2026年实践**：\n        *   **专业工具软件**：如F\nigma、Adobe全家桶、Blender等。设计师、工程师投入大量时间学习，形成了肌肉记忆和工作\n流依赖。\n        *   **无代码/低代码平台**：企业员工使用这些平台搭建了内部\n应用。这些应用和员工的技能都与该平台深度绑定。\n\n### 三、 利用“路径依赖”\n建立先发优势\n\n路径依赖的关键在于“尽早”和“做对”，让整个行业围绕你设\n定的轨迹发展。\n\n1.  **抢占技术标准与架构 (Seize Technical Standards & Architectures)**：\n\n    *   **策略**：在下一个技术浪潮的萌芽期（如Web3、元宇宙、通用\n人工智能应用层），率先提出并推广一个技术架构或行业标准。\n    *   **2026年实践**\n：\n        *   **AI模型与开发平台**：如果你能提供一个被广泛采用的基础AI模型和\n开发工具链（类似当年的Windows操作系统），那么整个AI应用生态都会围绕你的技术路径构建。\n        \n*   **新能源/物联网协议**：特斯拉（Tesla）通过早期布局并部分开放其充电网络标准，\n试图建立电动车领域的路径依赖。在物联网领域，谁的通信协议成为主流，谁就掌握了话\n语权。\n\n2.  **积累专有数据飞轮 (Accumulate Proprietary Data Flywheels)**：\n    \n*   **策略**：设计一个能够通过“产品使用 -> 数据产生 -> 模型优化 -> 体验提升 -> \n更多用户”的闭环来不断自我优化的系统。这是一个典型的路径依赖过程。\n    *   **20\n26年实践**：\n        *   **自动驾驶**：车辆在路上行驶的每一公里数据，都能\n用来训练和改进自动驾驶算法，使得拥有最多路测数据的公司（路径依赖的早期积累）获得难以\n被超越的算法优势。\n        *   **搜索引擎**：用户越多的搜索引擎，获得的搜索日志和点击数据就\n越多，就能更好地优化搜索结果，从而吸引更多用户。\n\n3.  **构建组织与文化惯性 (Build\n Organizational & Cultural Inertia)**：\n    *   **策略**：投资于独特的组织能力、企业文化和人才\n培养体系。这种“软实力”的路径依赖极难被模仿。\n    *   **202\n6年实践**：\n        *   **持续创新的文化**：像谷歌（Google）早期建立的工程师\n文化和“20%时间”项目，虽然难以量化，但它塑造了公司持续创新的路径\n，让公司总能抓住新的机遇。\n        *   **高效的供应链管理**：像亚马逊（Amazon）或\n台积电（TSMC）那样，投入数十年时间和巨额资本建立起来的全球供应链和精益\n运营能力，是典型的路径依赖壁垒，新进入者无法在短期内复制。\n\n### 总结：\n如何系统性地结合两者\n\n1.  **用“路径依赖”启动**：在市场早期，通过技术、\n标准或数据飞轮的布局，确立一个有利的发展轨迹。\n2.  **用“锁定效应”巩\n固**：当用户和合作伙伴开始沿着你设定的路径前进时，通过设计数据、生态和学习成本等锁定机制\n，让他们难以偏离这条路径。\n3.  **动态演化**：市场和技术总在变化。\n最强大的壁垒不是静止的，而是动态的。需要警惕路径依赖可能带来的“组织僵化\n”，在维持核心优势的同时，不断投资于新的路径探索，将用户从旧的锁定体系平滑过渡\n到新的锁定体系中。\n\n通过这种方式，你构建的就不是一个简单的“护城河”，而\n是一个具有强大引力场的“引力井”，不仅让用户难以离开，还会吸引更多外部资源向你靠\n拢。","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use

{"id":"websearch-842","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","k":5,"trials":[{"trialNum":1,"output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?\nBy 2026, the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding\n box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI will have moved beyond simple text-based instructions. They will be characterized by a combination of\n advanced textual cues, sophisticated visual prompting, and automated, learned prompting strategies that make the models more accurate, efficient, and\n robust.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the top techniques, from foundational to the cutting-edge:\n\n### 1. Advanced Text\nual Prompting: The Foundation\n\nWhile visual and automated prompting will be at the forefront, clear and detailed text prompts will remain\n a crucial foundation.\n\n*   **Hyper-Specific Instructions:** Your text prompts will need to be extremely precise. Instead\n of \"Find the tumor,\" a 2026-era prompt will be more like: \"Identify the hyper\ndense, spiculated mass in the upper left quadrant of the right lung, consistent with a primary lung carcinoma. The bounding\n box should tightly enclose the entire lesion, including the spiculated margins.\" This level of detail helps the model disambiguate between different\n types of tissues and pathologies.\n\n*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** For complex\n cases, you will use CoT to guide the model's reasoning process. You'll break down the detection task into a\n series of steps within the prompt itself. For example: \"1. Identify the liver in the abdominal CT scan. 2.\n Within the liver, locate any hypodense regions. 3. For each hypodense region, determine if it has\n the characteristics of a metastatic lesion. 4. Draw a bounding box around any confirmed metastatic lesions.\" This forces the model to follow\n a logical pathway, improving accuracy.\n\n*   **Instruction-Based Prompting:** Think of this as \"programming\" the model\n in natural language. You will provide a set of rules for the detection task. For example: \"Your task is to identify\n and draw bounding boxes around all vertebral compression fractures. A fracture is defined as a reduction of at least 20% in the height\n of the vertebral body. Ignore degenerative changes like osteophytes. The bounding box should be red for acute fractures and blue for chronic\n fractures.\"\n\n### 2. Visual Prompting: The Cutting Edge of Interactivity\n\nThe most significant advances will be in how\n users interact with the model visually. The \"prompt\" will be as much about showing as it is about telling.\n\n*   \n**Interactive Refinement:** The workflow will be a conversation between the user and the model. A radiologist might draw a quick\n, imprecise circle around a suspected abnormality (a \"weak\" visual prompt). The model will then return a \"best guess\n\" bounding box, which the user can then refine by clicking on the edges, adding points to include, or subtracting points to exclude.\n This iterative process will be far more efficient than manually drawing a perfect box from scratch.\n\n*   **Example-Based (\nFew-Shot) Prompting:** You will be able to provide a few examples of correct bounding boxes directly in the prompt.\n For instance, you could provide an image with one or two correctly identified and boxed lesions, and then in the next image, the\n model will be able to generalize from those examples and find all similar lesions.\n\n*   **Multi-Modal Prompts:** The\n most powerful technique will be the combination of text and visual cues in a single prompt. You'll be able to provide a\n detailed text description of what you're looking for *and* a rough visual guide. For example, you could circle a general\n area on a brain MRI and provide the text prompt: \"Within this circled region, identify and draw a bounding box around\n any areas of gadolinium enhancement, consistent with a high-grade glioma.\"\n\n### 3. Automated and Learned Prompting:\n The Future in 2026\n\nBy 2026, we will see the rise of models that can\n learn to prompt themselves, making the process even more efficient and scalable.\n\n*   **Automated Prompt Generation:** Instead\n of a human crafting the perfect prompt, you will have \"prompting modules\" that are trained on a small set of examples\n. You would provide, say, 10 examples of correctly identified lesions, and the module would learn the optimal combination\n of textual and visual prompts to find those lesions in new images. This will be crucial for large-scale analysis of medical imaging\n data.\n\n*   **Self-Prompting Models:** The most advanced models will be able to perform a \"first\n pass\" analysis of an image to identify potential areas of interest. They will then use these automatically generated regions as internal \"prompts\"\n to perform a more detailed, second-pass analysis, ultimately drawing a precise bounding box. This mimics the workflow of a human expert\n, who first scans an image for abnormalities and then zooms in to investigate further.\n\n*   **Robustness to Noisy Prompts\n:** There will be a major focus on making models that are resilient to the inherent imprecision of human interaction. Research into\n \"adversarial\" or \"noisy\" prompts will lead to models that can still produce accurate results even if the user'\ns visual prompt is slightly off-center, too large, or incomplete. This is essential for real-world clinical adoption\n.\n\nIn summary, prompt engineering for bounding box detection in medical imaging with Vertex AI in 2026 will\n be a dynamic, interactive, and increasingly automated process. The best techniques will seamlessly blend detailed natural language instructions with intuitive visual guidance\n, all while being powered by models that can learn to optimize their own prompts for the specific task at hand.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","timestamp":44009},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":44009},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686043179-b9180d9800c04","status":"completed","timestamp":44009},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686052923-9ba723139eb458","status":"completed","timestamp":44009},{"type":"message","content":"By 2026, the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding","timestamp":44009},{"type":"message","content":" box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI will have moved beyond simple text-based instructions.

While\n the core principles of providing clear and specific instructions to AI models will remain, the methods will become more sophisticated, automated, and deeply\n integrated into clinical workflows. Here are the best prompt engineering techniques you can expect to see:\n\n### 1. **\nAutomated Prompt Generation from Electronic Health Records (EHR)**\n\nInstead of manually crafting prompts, physicians will benefit from systems\n that automatically generate prompts based on a patient's EHR. For example, if a patient's record indicates a history\n of smoking and a suspected lung nodule, an automated system could generate a highly specific prompt like:\n\n> \"Analyze\n this chest CT scan for a spiculated, non-calcified nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung, consistent with adenocarcinoma\n, in a 65-year-old male with a 30-pack-year smoking history.\"\n\nOn\n Vertex AI, this could be implemented using a combination of Natural Language AI and Healthcare NLP API to extract relevant information from the EHR and\n then feed it into a vision model.\n\n### 2. **Integration with Medical Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs**\n\n\nPrompts will become more context-aware by directly referencing medical ontologies like SNOMED CT and LOINC. This will\n allow for more precise and standardized descriptions of pathologies. For example, instead of using a generic term like \"tumor,\" a prompt\n could use a specific SNOMED CT code:\n\n> \"Detect and draw a bounding box around any lesion matching SN\nOMED CT code '399994008' (Malignant neoplasm of lung).\"\n\n\nThis will improve the accuracy and consistency of the model's detections. Vertex AI's integration with knowledge graphs will\n be crucial for implementing this technique.\n\n### 3. **3D and 4D Prompting for Volumetric and\n Temporal Analysis**\n\nCurrent prompt engineering techniques are largely focused on 2D images. By 2026, we\n will see the rise of 3D and 4D prompting for volumetric and temporal analysis. This will allow physicians to specify regions\n of interest in 3D scans and track changes over time. For example, a prompt could look like this:\n\n\n> \"In this 4D cardiac MRI, identify and track the motion of the left ventricular wall during the systolic phase.\n Highlight any areas of akinesia.\"\n\nThis will require new types of prompts that can handle spatial and temporal coordinates, which\n will be supported by advanced vision models on Vertex AI.\n\n### 4. **Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning with\n Descriptive Prompts**\n\nWith advancements in few-shot and zero-shot learning, models will be able to detect new and rare\n pathologies with very few or even no examples. This will be made possible by using highly descriptive prompts that explain the key features of\n the pathology. For example, to detect a rare type of bone fracture, a prompt could be:\n\n> \"Identify\n a hairline fracture in the scaphoid bone, characterized by a thin, lucent line with minimal displacement, which is not visible on\n the initial X-ray but can be seen on a follow-up MRI.\"\n\nThis will enable the use of AI\n for a much wider range of diagnostic tasks and will be a key feature of Vertex AI's vision models.\n\n###\n 5. **Interactive and Conversational Prompting**\n\nThe process of prompt engineering will become more interactive and conversational.\n Physicians will be able to refine the model's detections by providing feedback in natural language. For example, if a model incorrectly identifies\n an artifact as a lesion, a physician could say:\n\n> \"That is not a lesion, it's a\n surgical clip. Please ignore it and look for any new lesions in the surrounding tissue.\"\n\nThis will create a more collaborative\n and intuitive workflow for medical image analysis, with Vertex AI's conversational AI capabilities playing a key role.\n\n***\n\n*","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","timestamp":60018},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":60018},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686105352-01b8ada144bac8","status":"completed","timestamp":60018},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686117555-cfbc5e3d298088","status":"completed","timestamp":60018},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":60018},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686131753-528fe93916fb28","status":"completed","timestamp":60018},{"type":"message","content":"By 2","timestamp":60018},{"type":"message","content":"026, prompt engineering for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI is expected to evolve significantly beyond current techniques.

The field is rapidly evolving, moving beyond simple\n text-based prompts to more sophisticated methods that incorporate visual and spatial information.\n\nHere are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding\n box detection in medical imaging with Vertex AI in 2026:\n\n### 1. **Leverage Foundation Models with\n Prompt Tuning**\n\nThe most significant trend is the use of large, pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) like Google\n's Vision and Language models, and adapting them to the medical domain.\n\n*   **Automated Prompt Generation:** Instead of manually\n crafting prompts, the state-of-the-art approach is to use a \"prompt module.\" This is an auxiliary network\n that is trained to automatically generate the most effective prompt embeddings from an input image. This is a form of \"prompt tuning\n\" where the model learns the best prompt for a given task.\n*   **Weakly Supervised Learning:** To\n train these prompt modules, you don't need expensive and time-consuming pixel-wise annotations. Instead, you can use weakly\n supervised learning with much easier-to-obtain bounding box annotations. This makes the process more efficient and scalable.\n\n### 2\n. **Multi-Modal and Multi-Task Prompting**\n\nThe most effective prompts are no longer just text-based. They are\n multi-modal, combining text, image, and even spatial information.\n\n*   **Spatial Prompts:** You can provide the model\n with a \"prompt\" that is actually a rough bounding box or a set of points on the image. The model then learns\n to refine this initial prompt to generate a more accurate bounding box.\n*   **Multi-Task Learning:** The best\n results are often achieved by training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, you can train a model to not only detect\n bounding boxes but also to count objects and provide a textual description of the findings. This multi-task approach forces the model to learn\n a more holistic understanding of the medical image, which in turn improves the accuracy of the bounding box detection.\n\n### 3\n. **Structured Output with JSON**\n\nFor practical applications, it's crucial to get the output in a structured format.\n\n\n*   **JSON Output:** With models like Gemini 2.0 on Vertex AI, you can explicitly instruct the model to provide\n the bounding box coordinates in a JSON format. This makes it easy to parse the output and integrate it into a downstream application.\n\n*   **Example-Based Prompting:** To ensure the model consistently produces the correct JSON format, provide a clear example in your prompt\n. This is a form of \"few-shot\" or \"one-shot\" learning where you give the model an\n example of the desired output.\n\n### 4. **Robustness Evaluation with Adversarial Bounding Boxes**\n\nTo build\n reliable medical imaging models, it's essential to evaluate their robustness.\n\n*   **Adversarial Bounding Boxes:**\n A cutting-edge technique is to use a method called BREPS (Bounding-Box Robustness Evaluation of Promptable Segmentation).\n This involves generating \"adversarial\" bounding boxes that are designed to trick the model into making a mistake. By testing your\n model with these adversarial examples, you can identify its weaknesses and make it more robust.\n\n### 5. **Chain\n-of-Thought Prompting for Complex Cases**\n\nFor more complex medical images with multiple abnormalities, you can use a\n \"chain-of-thought\" prompting technique.\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** With this technique, you instruct\n the model to \"think step by step\" and to first identify the different abnormalities in the image and then to draw a bounding box around\n each one. This can lead to more accurate and reliable results in complex cases.\n\n### Future Trends for 202\n6 and Beyond\n\nLooking ahead, we can expect to see even more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques emerge.\n\n*   **Interactive\n Prompting:** The future is likely to be interactive. A clinician will be able to provide a rough initial prompt, and then\n the model will ask clarifying questions to refine the prompt and generate a more accurate result.\n*   **Automated Machine\n Learning (AutoML):** We can expect to see more AutoML features in Vertex AI that will automatically discover the best prompt engineering techniques\n for a given dataset and task.\n*   **Integration with Clinical Workflows:** The ultimate goal is to seamlessly integrate these\n models into clinical workflows. This will require not only accurate models but also intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that allow clinicians to easily\n interact with the models and provide feedback.\n\nIn conclusion, the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging with Vertex AI\n in 2026 are all about moving beyond simple text-based prompts to more sophisticated methods that leverage the power\n of foundation models, multi-modal and multi-task learning, and advanced robustness evaluation techniques. By adopting these techniques, you can build\n more accurate, reliable, and clinically useful medical imaging models.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","timestamp":51146},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":51146},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686313898-4b64656b60956","status":"completed","timestamp":51146},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769686325027-9060ce713902f","status":"completed","timestamp":51146},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":51146},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769686337054-02d87bb3b97a18","status":"completed","timestamp":51146},{"type":"message","content":"As of early 202","timestamp":51146},{"type":"message","content":"6, the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI revolve around a combination of leveraging powerful","timestamp":51146},{"type":"message","content":" foundation models, employing weakly supervised learning, and utilizing advanced prompt tuning strategies.

Here's a breakdown of the key strategies:\n\n### Understanding the Threat: Proxy Rotation\n Attacks\n\nProxy rotation attacks involve attackers using a large pool of proxy IP addresses to distribute their requests, making it difficult to\n detect and block malicious activity. This technique is used for various malicious purposes, including:\n\n*   **Web Scraping:** Ste\naling pricing information, product details, and user reviews.\n*   **Credential Stuffing:** Testing stolen usernames and passwords to\n take over user accounts.\n*   **Account Takeover:** Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts for fraudulent purposes.\n*   \n**Ad Fraud:** Generating fake clicks on ads to defraud advertisers.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS)\n Attacks:** Overwhelming the platform with traffic to make it unavailable to legitimate users.\n\n### Detection Techniques\n\nThe key to detecting proxy\n rotation attacks is to look beyond IP addresses and focus on other indicators of malicious activity. Here are some effective detection techniques:\n\n\n*   **Behavioral Analysis:**\n    *   **User and Device Behavior:** Monitor user behavior for signs of automation, such\n as unusually high request rates, non-human-like browsing patterns, and suspiciously fast completion of forms.\n    *\n   **Transaction Analysis:** Analyze transaction patterns for anomalies, such as multiple orders from different accounts being shipped to the same address.\n\n\n*   **Device Fingerprinting:**\n    *   **Browser and Device Attributes:** Collect and analyze a wide range of browser and device\n attributes to create a unique fingerprint for each user. This can include the user agent, screen resolution, operating system, and\n installed fonts.\n    *   **Canvas Fingerprinting:** Use the HTML5 canvas element to create a unique and persistent fingerprint\n of each user's device.\n\n*   **IP Reputation and Geolocation:**\n    *   **IP Black\nlists:** Use IP blacklists to block traffic from known malicious IP addresses.\n    *   **Geolocation Analysis:** Analyze the\n geolocation of IP addresses to identify suspicious patterns, such as a user's location changing rapidly or being inconsistent with their stated location.\n\n\n*   **Machine Learning:**\n    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies in user behavior and\n traffic patterns that may indicate a proxy rotation attack.\n    *   **Bot Detection:** Train machine learning models to distinguish\n between human users and bots based on their behavior.\n\n### Prevention Techniques\n\nOnce you have detected a proxy rotation attack, you\n can take steps to prevent it from succeeding. Here are some effective prevention techniques:\n\n*   **Web Application Firewall (\nWAF):**\n    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting based on a combination of factors, such as device fingerprint\n, user account, and session ID, in addition to IP address.\n    *   **IP Blocking:** Block traffic\n from IP addresses that are known to be part of a proxy network or that have a poor reputation.\n\n*   **CAPT\nCHA Challenges:**\n    *   **Adaptive CAPTCHA:** Use adaptive CAPTCHA challenges that are only presented to users who\n exhibit suspicious behavior. This can help to reduce friction for legitimate users.\n\n*   **Bot Management Solutions:**\n    *\n   **Specialized Tools:** Consider using a commercial bot management solution that is specifically designed to detect and prevent sophisticated bot attacks,\n including those that use proxy rotation.\n\n*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n    *   **Account\n Security:** Encourage or require users to enable 2FA to protect their accounts from takeover attempts.\n\nBy implementing a combination\n of these detection and prevention techniques, e-commerce platforms like Shopee can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to proxy rotation\n attacks in 2026 and beyond.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":39142},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":39142},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769687003088-c01d8d1b6256a8","status":"completed","timestamp":39142},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":39142},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769687014027-18b2c4d3bb81a8","status":"completed","timestamp":39142},{"type":"message","content":"Detecting and preventing proxy rotation attacks on a large e-commerce","timestamp":39142},{"type":"message","content":" platform like Shopee in 2026 requires a sophisticated, multi-layered approach that focuses on user behavior and device","timestamp":39142},{"type":"message","content":" identity rather than just IP addresses.

As\n attackers increasingly use advanced techniques like rapid proxy rotation and AI-driven bots, defense mechanisms must also evolve. Here's a\n breakdown of how to detect and prevent such attacks in 2026.\n\n### Detecting Proxy Rotation Attacks\n\n####\n 1. Advanced Device and Browser Fingerprinting\n*   **What it is:** Creating a unique identifier for each user\n's device based on a combination of attributes like browser version, operating system, screen resolution, installed fonts, and even\n hardware characteristics.\n*   **Why it's effective in 2026:** Even if an attacker rotates\n through thousands of IP addresses, the underlying device fingerprint will remain consistent, allowing you to link the seemingly disparate requests to a single\n entity. Advanced fingerprinting techniques in 2026 will also incorporate machine learning to detect attempts to spoof or manipulate\n these fingerprints.\n\n#### 2. Behavioral Analysis with Machine Learning\n*   **What it is:** Using machine learning models to\n establish a baseline of normal user behavior and then identifying deviations from that baseline in real-time.\n*   **Why it's\n effective in 2026:** Instead of relying on simple rules, machine learning models can analyze hundreds of behavioral data\n points, such as mouse movements, typing speed, page navigation patterns, and time spent on pages. In 202\n6, these models will be sophisticated enough to detect subtle anomalies that indicate bot activity, even when the bot is trying to mimic human behavior\n. Unsupervised learning models will be particularly important for identifying new and unknown attack patterns.\n\n#### 3. IP Reputation and\n Anomaly Detection\n*   **What it is:** Going beyond simple IP blocklists. This involves using advanced IP intelligence services to identify\n the type of IP address (residential, datacenter, mobile) and its historical reputation.\n*   **Why it'\ns effective in 2026:** In 2026, IP intelligence will be more granular, allowing platforms\n to assign a risk score to each IP address based on a multitude of factors. A sudden surge in traffic from a previously\n unknown residential IP range, for example, could be flagged for further investigation. Anomaly detection algorithms can also identify suspicious patterns,\n such as a single user session rapidly cycling through geographically dispersed IP addresses.\n\n#### 4. Continuous and Invisible CAPTCHA\n Challenges\n*   **What it is:** Moving away from traditional, user-disrupting CAPTCHAs. In\n 2026, the most effective CAPTCHAs will be invisible to legitimate users.\n*   **Why it\n's effective in 2026:** These \"invisible\" challenges will run in the background, analyzing user behavior\n and device characteristics to determine if the user is human. If suspicious activity is detected, a challenge may be presented, but\n for most users, the experience will be seamless. Advanced CAPTCHAs will also be more resistant to automated solvers.\n\n###\n Preventing Proxy Rotation Attacks\n\n#### 1. Multi-Factor and Biometric Authentication\n*   **What it is:** Requ\niring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to their accounts.\n*   **Why it's effective\n in 2026:** By 2026, this will be a standard security practice. The use of biometric\n authenticators like fingerprint scanners, facial recognition, and even voice recognition will become more common, adding a significant layer of security that\n is difficult for bots to bypass.\n\n#### 2. Proactive Bot and Threat Mitigation\n*   **What it is:**\n Using a dedicated bot management solution that can identify and block malicious bots in real-time.\n*   **Why it's\n effective in 2026:** These solutions will use a combination of the detection techniques mentioned above to distinguish between human\n users, good bots (like search engine crawlers), and bad bots. When a bad bot is detected, the solution\n can automatically block its requests, present it with a CAPTCHA, or even feed it false data to disrupt the attack\n.\n\n#### 3. AI-Powered Security Rules and Policies\n*   **What it is:** Moving from static security\n rules to dynamic, AI-powered policies that adapt to new threats in real-time.\n*   **Why it's\n effective in 2026:** An AI-powered security system can analyze data from across the platform and automatically adjust security\n policies to block emerging threats. For example, if the system detects a new type of bot that is targeting a specific product page\n, it can automatically tighten security measures for that page.\n\n#### 4.

Here's a breakdown of strategies that would be effective in 2026:\n\n### Understanding the\n Threat\n\nProxy rotation attacks involve threat actors rapidly changing their IP addresses to bypass security measures like rate limiting and IP-based blocking\n. This allows them to perform malicious activities at scale, such as:\n\n*   **Credential Stuffing:** Testing stolen\n usernames and passwords.\n*   **Account Takeover:** Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.\n*   **Scalping\n:** Using bots to buy limited-stock items faster than legitimate users.\n*   **Content Scraping:** Stealing product\n information, pricing, and user reviews.\n*   **Fake Reviews and Ratings:** Manipulating product and seller ratings.\n\n\n### Detection Techniques\n\n1.  **Behavioral Analysis:** Instead of focusing solely on IPs, analyze user behavior. Machine\n learning models can identify non-human patterns, such as:\n    *   **High Request Velocity:** An abnormally high number of\n requests from a single device or user account, even if the IP address changes.\n    *   **Unnatural Navigation:** Bots\n often follow predictable paths and don't mimic the browsing patterns of real users (e.g., no mouse movements, immediate jumps\n to checkout).\n    *   **Transaction Speed:** Completing forms or checkout processes faster than a human possibly could.\n\n2\n.  **Device Fingerprinting:** This technique identifies and tracks devices, even when the IP address changes. It analyzes a\n combination of attributes like:\n    *   Browser type and version\n    *   Operating system\n    *   Screen\n resolution\n    *   Installed fonts and plugins\n    *   Canvas and WebGL fingerprinting\n\n    If multiple accounts\n are accessed from the same device fingerprint but with different IPs, it's a strong indicator of malicious activity.\n\n3\n.  **IP Reputation Analysis:** While attackers rotate IPs, they often use known proxy networks. Subscribing to IP\n reputation feeds can help identify and block requests from IPs associated with:\n    *   Data centers and hosting providers (less\n likely to be legitimate residential users)\n    *   Known proxy and VPN services\n    *   Tor exit nodes\n\n4.\n  **Geolocation Analysis:** A user account rapidly jumping between different geographical locations is a major red flag. For instance, a login\n from Singapore followed by an attempted purchase from a US-based IP a few seconds later is highly suspicious.\n\n### Prevention\n Strategies\n\n1.  **Advanced CAPTCHA:** Move beyond simple image-based CAPTCHAs. In 202\n6, solutions like Google's reCAPTCHA v3 or hCaptcha are more sophisticated. They analyze user behavior to\n determine if a challenge is necessary, making the experience smoother for legitimate users and more difficult for bots.\n\n2.  **Rate Lim\niting with Nuance:** Instead of basic IP-based rate limiting, implement more intelligent throttling based on:\n    *   **Device\n ID:** Limit requests per device.\n    *   **User Account:** Prevent a single account from making an excessive number of requests\n.\n    *   **Session ID:** Track and limit activity within a single user session.\n\n3.  **Multi\n-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require a second factor of authentication (e.g., a code sent to a\n mobile device) for sensitive actions like logging in, changing passwords, or making high-value purchases. This is a very\n effective defense against credential stuffing and account takeover.\n\n4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Bot Management\n:** Deploy a modern WAF that includes specialized bot detection and mitigation capabilities. These solutions use a combination of the detection techniques mentioned\n above to identify and block malicious bot traffic in real-time.\n\n5.  **API Security:** Many attacks target APIs directly.\n Secure your APIs with:\n    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure every API request is properly authenticated and authorized.\n    \n*   **Request Validation:** Validate all incoming API requests to ensure they are well-formed.\n    *   **Sp\nike Arrest:** Prevent sudden bursts of traffic to your APIs.\n\nBy combining these detection and prevention strategies, e-commerce platforms\n can create a robust defense against proxy rotation attacks and other automated threats.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":35169},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express","status":"pending","timestamp":35169},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-express-1769687218244-0f01e14576cc2","status":"completed","timestamp":35169},{"type":"message","content":"E-commerce platforms like Shopee can implement a multi-layered security approach to detect and prevent proxy rotation","timestamp":35169},{"type":"message","content":" attacks.

This\n means applications are expected to draw their content behind the system status and navigation bars to provide a more immersive experience. Developers must\n handle insets to prevent critical UI elements from being obscured by the system UI.\n\n### Key Guidelines for Inset Handling\n\n1\n.  **Use `WindowInsets`:** The `WindowInsets` API is the primary tool for managing the space occupied by system\n UI elements. Both Jetpack Compose (`WindowInsets` class) and the View system (`WindowInsetsCompat`) provide access\n to inset information.\n\n2.  **Understand Inset Types:**\n    *   **`systemBars()`**:\n This is the most frequently used inset type. It defines the area where the system UI is displayed.

Starting with Android 15, this is the default behavior.\n\n### Understanding Window Insets\n\nWindow insets provide\n your application with information about how much space on the screen is taken up by system UI elements like the navigation bar, status bar, and\n software keyboard. By listening for and reacting to insets, you can adjust your app's layout to avoid content being obscured by\n or conflicting with the system UI.\n\n### Key Inset Types\n\n*   **System Bars (`WindowInsetsCompat.Type\n.systemBars()`):** This is the most common inset type and represents the space occupied by the status and navigation bars. You\n should use these insets to pad views that should not be obscured by the system bars.\n*   **Gesture Navigation (`Window\nInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures()` or `WindowInsets.safeGestures` in Compose):** These insets define the\n areas where system gestures (like the swipe-from-edge for \"back\" and swipe-from-bottom for \"home\n\") take precedence. You should use these insets to ensure that your app's interactive elements (like bottom sheets,\n carousels, or game controls) don't conflict with these system gestures.\n*   **Safe Drawing and\n Safe Content (`WindowInsets.safeDrawing` and `WindowInsets.safeContent` in Compose):**\n    *   \n`safeDrawing`: Represents the area where it is safe to draw content without it being obscured by any system UI.\n    *   \n`safeContent`: A combination of `safeDrawing` and `safeGestures`, representing the area where it's safe to\n both draw content and have interactive elements.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n1.  **Enable Edge-to-Edge:** In\n your `Activity`, you need to tell the system that you will handle window insets. This is done by calling \n`WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)`.\n\n2.  **Listen for Insets:**\n\n    *   **Views:** Use `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` to get the insets and apply padding\n or margins to your views accordingly.\n    *   **Jetpack Compose:** Compose has built-in support for window insets.\n You can use modifiers like `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.safeDrawing)` to automatically apply padding to your compos\nables.\n\n3.  **Handling Gesture Navigation:**\n    *   The gesture navigation bar is a transparent bar at\n the bottom of the screen. You should ensure that tappable elements are not placed behind it.\n    *   For swipe\nable content near the edges of the screen, use the `systemGestureInsets` to add padding and prevent your app's gestures\n from being intercepted by the system's back gesture.\n\n### Example (Jetpack Compose)\n\n\n```kotlin\nimport androidx\n.compose.foundation.layout.Column\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout.WindowInsets\nimport androidx.\ncompose.foundation.layout.safeDrawing\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout.windowInsetsPadding\nimport androidx.compose.\nmaterial3.Text\nimport androidx.compose.runtime.Composable\nimport androidx.compose.ui.Modifier\n\n@\nComposable\nfun MyScreen() {\n    Column(\n        modifier = Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.safeDrawing\n)\n    ) {\n        // Your screen content here\n        Text(\"This text will not be obscured by the system\n bars.\")\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create modern, immersive Android applications that provide a great\n user experience on a wide range of devices.

Here are the key principles and practices:\n\n### \n1. Edge-to-Edge by Default\n\nStarting with Android 15 (SDK 35), apps are\n displayed edge-to-edge by default. This means your app will draw behind the system status bar and navigation bar,\n creating a more modern and seamless user experience. You must ensure your app correctly handles these overlapping areas.\n\n### 2. Understanding\n and Using Window Insets\n\n`WindowInsets` are the cornerstone of managing the space used by the system UI. They provide the\n dimensions of system elements so you can adjust your app's layout accordingly.\n\n*   **`WindowInsets.safe\nContent`**: This is the all-in-one solution that provides padding to avoid both visual and gesture-based conflicts\n with the system UI. It is the recommended starting point for most apps.\n*   **`WindowInsets.safeDrawing\n`**: Use this to prevent your content from being visually obscured by system bars. This is for padding UI elements that should not\n be drawn under the status or navigation bars.\n*   **`WindowInsets.safeGestures`**: This is\n crucial for preventing conflicts between your app's gestures and system gestures (like the back gesture or home swipe). Use this to\n pad swipeable views, carousels, games, and bottom sheets.\n*   **`systemBars()`**: A\n commonly used inset type that provides the dimensions of both the status and navigation bars.\n\n### 3. Gesture Navigation Considerations\n\n\nWith gesture navigation, the traditional navigation buttons are replaced by a gesture handle. This has several implications for your app's design:\n\n\n*   **Avoid the Gesture Area**: Do not place interactive elements, such as buttons or touch targets, within the\n gesture navigation inset area at the bottom of the screen. The system gestures will take priority, making your UI unresponsive in that region.\n\n*   **Handle Back Gestures**: The back gesture involves swiping from the left or right edge of the screen.\n If your app has its own horizontal swiping gestures (e.g., in a `ViewPager2`), use the `safeGestures\n` insets to provide padding and prevent conflicts.\n\n### 4. Implementation in Jetpack Compose and Views\n\n*   **\nJetpack Compose (Recommended)**: Compose offers a modern and intuitive API for handling insets. You can use `WindowInsets` directly\n as modifiers to pad your layouts:\n    \n```kotlin\n    import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column\n    import androidx\n.compose.foundation.layout.WindowInsets\n    import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.safeDrawing\n    import androidx\n.compose.foundation.layout.windowInsetsPadding\n    import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier\n\n    @Composable\n\n    fun MyScreen() {\n        Column(\n            modifier = Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.safe\nDrawing)\n        ) {\n            // Your screen content here\n        }\n    }\n    \n```\n\n*   **Views\n**: If you are using the traditional View system, you can use `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` to react\n to inset changes and apply padding dynamically:\n    \n```kotlin\n    import androidx.core.view.ViewCompat\n\n    import androidx.core.view.WindowInsetsCompat\n    import androidx.core.view.updatePadding\n\n    ViewCompat\n.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(myView) { view, windowInsets ->\n        val insets = windowInsets.get\nInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n        view.updatePadding(\n            left = insets.left\n,\n            top = insets.top,\n            right = insets.right,\n            bottom = in\nsets.bottom\n        )\n        WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### 5. Transparency\n and System Bar Styling\n\nFor a true edge-to-edge effect, the system bars should be transparent. In your\n theme, you can set the navigation bar color to be transparent. For more fine-grained control, especially with the 3-\nbutton navigation, you can use `window.isNavigationBarContrastEnforced = false` in Jetpack Compose to ensure the navigation bar is\n fully transparent.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create modern, visually appealing Android apps that take full advantage of the\n available screen space while providing an intuitive and conflict-free user experience.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","timestamp":26619},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":26619},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769687360320-d3aa92663fd2f8","status":"completed","timestamp":26619},{"type":"message","content":"The 2026 guidelines for Android","timestamp":26619},{"type":"message","content":" handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets are centered around creating immersive, edge-to-edge experiences by default, while ensuring","timestamp":26619},{"type":"message","content":" that app content and gestures do not conflict with the system UI.

Your app will\n draw behind the system status and navigation bars. This is the standard user experience.\n\n2.  **Use `WindowInsets\n` for Layout:** The `WindowInsets` APIs are the cornerstone of inset handling. They provide your app with the dimensions of\n system UI elements so you can adjust your layout accordingly. For modern UIs, it is highly recommended to use the `WindowInsets\n` support in Jetpack Compose.\n\n3.  **Prioritize Content and Interaction:** The primary goal is to ensure that\n important content is not obscured and that user interactions are not broken by system UI or gestures.\n\n### Key Inset Types and\n Their Usage\n\n*   **`WindowInsets.safeContent`**: This is the most important inset type to use. It'\ns a combination of `safeDrawing` and `safeGestures`, and it provides a \"safe\" area for your app\n's content and interactive elements. Use this to pad your UI to avoid both visual overlap and gesture conflicts.\n\n*   **\n`WindowInsets.safeDrawing`**: Use this when you only need to prevent your UI from being drawn behind system elements\n like the status bar or navigation bar.\n\n*   **`WindowInsets.safeGestures`**: This inset type\n is crucial for preventing conflicts between your app's gestures (e.g., in a game, a bottom sheet, or\n a carousel) and the system's navigation gestures (e.g., the back gesture).\n\n### Gesture Navigation Guidelines\n\n\n*   **Avoid Interactive Elements Under Gesture Insets:** Do not place buttons or other interactive elements within the area defined\n by the gesture navigation insets. This will prevent them from being unclickable or interfering with system navigation.\n\n*   \n**Transparent Navigation Bar:** The gesture navigation bar should be transparent to create a seamless, edge-to-edge experience. If\n you are still supporting 3-button navigation, you can achieve a transparent navigation bar by setting the `window.is\nNavigationBarContrastEnforced` property to `false`.\n\n### Implementation in Jetpack Compose\n\nFor new applications, Jetpack Compose is\n the recommended UI toolkit. It provides a more intuitive way to handle insets. You can use modifiers to apply padding based\n on the window insets.\n\nHere is a basic example in Compose:\n\n\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.compose.\nfoundation.layout.Column\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout.WindowInsets\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout\n.asPaddingValues\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout.padding\nimport androidx.compose.foundation.layout.safeContent\n\nimport androidx.compose.material3.Text\nimport androidx.compose.runtime.Composable\nimport androidx.compose\n.ui.Modifier\n\n@Composable\nfun MyScreen() {\n    Column(\n        modifier = Modifier.padding\n(WindowInsets.safeContent.asPaddingValues())\n    ) {\n        // Your screen content here\n        Text(\"\nThis content is safe from system UI and gestures.\")\n    }\n}\n\n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","timestamp":24644},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":24644},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769687404809-66fa595ed48e8","status":"completed","timestamp":24644},{"type":"message","content":"Based","timestamp":24644},{"type":"message","content":" on the latest Android documentation from 2026, here are the key guidelines for handling insets and gesture navigation:","timestamp":24644},{"type":"message","content":"\n\n### Core Principles for 2026\n\n1.  **Embrace Edge-to-Edge:** Apps","timestamp":24644},{"type":"message","content":" targeting Android 15 (SDK 35) and higher are edge-to-edge by default.

Support Lifecycle (The Most Critical Difference)\n\n*   **.NET Framework 4.5.2\n:** **Out of support.** Microsoft ended support for .NET Framework 4.5.2, 4.6, and \n4.6.1 on **April 26, 2022**. This is because they were signed\n with the now-insecure SHA-1 hashing algorithm.

Its support is tied to the lifecycle of the underlying Windows Operating System on which it is installed. As\n of 2025, it will continue to be supported on modern Windows versions.\n\n### 2. Technical\n and Feature Differences\n\nSince versions of the .NET Framework from 4.5 to 4.8 are in-place\n updates, they share the same Common Language Runtime (CLR). The primary differences are in the class libraries, performance, and security\n.\n\nHere are some of the notable improvements in .NET 4.8 that are not in 4.5.2\n:\n\n*   **Security and Cryptography:**\n    *   **.NET 4.8** has updated managed\n cryptography classes that no longer throw a `CryptographicException` in FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) mode.\n    *   \nSupport for newer security standards and protocols has been added since 4.5.2.\n*   **Performance:**\n    *\n   General performance improvements in the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler and other areas of the runtime.\n    \n*   The ZLib compression library used internally was updated in 4.8, leading to better compression performance.\n*   \n**Runtime and Framework Features:**\n    *   **Anti-Malware Scanning:** .NET 4.8,\n when running on Windows 10, can trigger scans of assemblies loaded from byte arrays by antimalware solutions that implement the Ant\nimalware Scan Interface (AMSI).\n    *   **Accessibility Improvements:** Significant accessibility improvements have been made in Windows\n Forms and WPF between 4.5.2 and 4.8.\n    *   **High-D\nPI Support:** Better support for high-DPI displays in Windows Forms and WPF applications was introduced in versions after 4.\n5.2.\n    *   **Updated Standards Support:** Support for newer standards like Unicode 8.0 and beyond\n, and updated cryptography standards.\n\n### 3. The Future: .NET (Core) vs. .NET Framework\n\nThe\n most significant contextual difference in 2025 is the evolution of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n*   **.NET\n Framework 4.8** is considered a legacy platform. While supported, it is not the focus of new development from\n Microsoft.\n*   **.NET (formerly .NET Core)**, with versions like .NET 8 (LTS),\n is the future.

This provides an additional layer of security for your applications.\n*   **Cryptography Updates\n:** The managed cryptography classes in .NET 4.8 have been updated to avoid throwing `CryptographicException` when\n the system is in FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) mode. This simplifies development and deployment in environments with strict security requirements.\n\n*   **Improved High-DPI and Accessibility:** .NET 4.8 includes numerous improvements for high-DPI\n rendering and accessibility, particularly in Windows Forms and WPF applications. This ensures your applications look and function better on modern displays and\n are more usable for people with disabilities.\n*   **Updated ZLib Library:** The `clrcompression.dll` assembly\n, which handles data compression, was updated to use ZLib Version 1.2.11, offering better performance\n and stability for compression-related tasks.\n\n### Support and Future of .NET Framework\n\n*   **.NET Framework 4\n.8 is the Last Version:** Microsoft has shifted its focus to the cross-platform and open-source **.NET** (formerly\n .NET Core), with .NET 8 being the current Long-Term Support (LTS) release. .NET Framework \n4.8 is the final major version of the traditional, Windows-only framework.\n*   **Long-Term\n Support:** While it is the last version, .NET Framework 4.8.1 is included in the latest versions\n of Windows, including Windows Server 2025. Its support is tied to the lifecycle of the operating system, which\n means it will be supported for many years to come.\n*   **In-Place Updates:** All versions of the\n .NET Framework from 4.5.x to 4.8 are in-place updates. This means they share\n the same underlying CLR and that an application built for 4.5.2 will run on a system with 4.8\n installed without any changes.\n\n### Recommendation for 2025\n\nFor any new development, it is highly recommended\n to use the latest version of **.NET (e.g., .NET 8 or newer)**.

Support Lifecycle (The Most Critical Difference)\n\n\n*   **.NET Framework 4.5.2:** Support for version 4.5.2 **ended on April \n26, 2022**. In 2025, this version will have been unsupported for several years.\n This means it receives no security updates, bug fixes, or technical support from Microsoft, making any application running on it a potential\n security risk.\n*   **.NET Framework 4.8:** This is the **final version of the .NET\n Framework** and is considered a component of the Windows operating system. Its support lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of the Windows OS\n it is installed on. This means it will continue to be supported with security and critical bug fixes for many years to come, well\n beyond 2025.\n\n### 2. Features and Enhancements\n\n.NET Framework 4.8 includes\n all the features and improvements from the versions released after 4.5.2 (i.e., 4.6,\n 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.\n1, 4.7.2). Some of the most notable improvements in 4.8 over 4.5\n.2 include:\n\n*   **Modern C# Support:** .NET Framework 4.8 includes the Roslyn compiler, which\n supports C# language features up to version 7.3. Version 4.5.2 is limited to an\n older version of the C# language.\n*   **High-DPI and UI Enhancements:** Significant improvements were made for\n high-DPI displays in Windows Forms and WPF applications, which is crucial for modern monitors.\n*   **Security and\n Cryptography:** .NET 4.8 includes updated security protocols (like TLS 1.2 and 1.3\n by default in some configurations) and improved cryptographic libraries.\n*   **Performance:** Numerous performance improvements have been made to the\n Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and other parts of the framework, leading to better application performance.\n*   \n**Accessibility:** Enhancements have been made to improve accessibility in UI frameworks like Windows Forms and WPF.\n\n### 3.\n The Path Forward: .NET vs. .NET Framework\n\nBy 2025, the conversation around .NET development\n will be heavily focused on the modern, cross-platform **.NET (e.g., .NET 8,\n .NET 9, etc.)**, which is the successor to .NET Framework.\n\n*   **.NET Framework 4.\n8** is for existing Windows-only applications. It is in maintenance mode and will not receive new features.\n*\n   **Modern .NET** is where all new development and innovation is happening. It is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS\n), has significant performance advantages, and supports the latest versions of C#.\n\n### Summary for 2025\n\n| Feature\n | .NET Framework 4.5.2 | .NET Framework 4.8 |\n| :--- | :\n--- | :--- |\n| **Support Status** | **Unsupported (End of Life)** | **Supported** (\nTied to OS lifecycle) |\n| **Security Updates** | None | Yes |\n| **C# Version\n** | Older (pre-Roslyn) | Up to C# 7.3 |\n| **High-\nDPI Support** | Limited | Greatly Improved |\n| **Performance**| Good | Better |\n| **\nNew Features** | No | No (Maintenance mode) |\n\n**In short, in 2025, there\n is no reason to be using .NET Framework 4.5.2.** It is an unsupported and insecure platform. All\n .NET Framework applications should be upgraded to **at least .NET Framework 4.8** to ensure they are secure and running\n on a supported runtime.
