Let me provide a comprehensive tutorial on setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo for 2026:\n\n---\n\n# Complete Guide: Setting Up shadcn/UI in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026)\n\n## Overview\n\nshadcn/ui now has native monorepo support, making it much easier to integrate with Turborepo. The CLI understands monorepo structures and automatically handles component installation, dependencies, and import paths.\n\n> **Note:** This setup uses **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS v4** by default.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1: Create a New Monorepo Project (Recommended for New Projects)\n\n### Step 1: Initialize the Project\n\nRun the init command and select the monorepo option:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm (recommended)\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using yarn\nnpx shadcn@canary init\n\n# Using bun\nbunx shadcn@canary init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select **\"Next.js (Monorepo)\"**:\n\n```\n? Which project type would you like to create?\n  ○ Next.js\n  ○ Vite + React\n  ● Next.js (Monorepo)\n  ○ Remix\n  ○ Astro\n```\n\n### Step 2: Project Structure\n\nThis creates a Turborepo with two workspaces:\n\n```\nmy-app/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/                    # Your Next.js application\n│       ├── app/\n│       ├── components/         # App-specific components\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for web app\n│       └── package.json\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/                     # Shared UI components\n│       ├── src/\n│       │   ├── components/     # shadcn components go here\n│       │   ├── hooks/\n│       │   └── lib/\n│       ├── components.json     # shadcn config for UI package\n│       └── package.json\n├── turbo.json\n├── package.json\n└── pnpm-workspace.yaml\n```\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Add shadcn/ui to an Existing Turborepo\n\n### Step 1: Create the UI Package\n\nCreate a `packages/ui` directory with the following structure:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/ui/src/components packages/ui/src/hooks packages/ui/src/lib\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create `packages/ui/package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@workspace/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.7.0\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.1\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^2.6.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create `packages/ui/components.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": false,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create `apps/web/components.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {},\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@workspace/ui/components\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Create the Utils File\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { clsx, type ClassValue } from \"clsx\"\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\"\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Configure TypeScript\n\nCreate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2020\",\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2020\", \"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\"],\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"jsx\": \"react-jsx\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"declaration\": true,\n    \"declarationMap\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Update Your App's Dependencies\n\nIn `apps/web/package.json`, add the UI package as a dependency:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@workspace/ui\": \"workspace:*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Adding Components\n\n### Adding UI Components\n\nRun the `add` command from your **app directory** (e.g., `apps/web`):\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\n\n# Add individual components\nnpx shadcn@canary add button\nnpx shadcn@canary add card\nnpx shadcn@canary add input\n\n# Add multiple components at once\nnpx shadcn@canary add button card input dialog\n\n# Add blocks (pre-built component combinations)\nnpx shadcn@canary add login-01\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- **UI components** (button, card, etc.) → Installed to `packages/ui/src/components/`\n- **Blocks** (login-01, etc.) → Component dependencies go to `packages/ui`, the block itself goes to `apps/web/components/`\n\n---\n\n## Using Components in Your App\n\n### Importing Components\n\n```tsx\n// Import from the shared UI package\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\n\n// Import hooks\nimport { useToast } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-toast\"\n\n// Import utilities\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n\nexport default function MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>Welcome</CardTitle>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button variant=\"default\">Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration\n\n### `apps/web/app/globals.css`\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Your custom theme variables */\n  --color-background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --color-foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --color-primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n  --color-primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);\n  /* ... more CSS variables */\n}\n```\n\n### `packages/ui/src/styles.css`\n\n```css\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Turborepo Configuration\n\n### `turbo.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://turbo.build/schema.json\",\n  \"ui\": \"tui\",\n  \"tasks\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"],\n      \"outputs\": [\".next/**\", \"!.next/cache/**\", \"dist/**\"]\n    },\n    \"dev\": {\n      \"cache\": false,\n      \"persistent\": true\n    },\n    \"lint\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"]\n    },\n    \"typecheck\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `pnpm-workspace.yaml`\n\n```yaml\npackages:\n  - \"apps/*\"\n  - \"packages/*\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **components.json** | Every workspace needs one |\n| **Matching styles** | Same `style`, `iconLibrary`, and `baseColor` in all `components.json` files |\n| **Tailwind v4** | Leave `tailwind` config empty in `components.json` |\n| **Aliases** | Properly define import aliases in each workspace |\n\n---\n\n## Common Commands\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# Start development\npnpm dev\n\n# Build all packages\npnpm build\n\n# Add a new component\ncd apps/web && npx shadcn@canary add [component-name]\n\n# Run type checking\npnpm typecheck\n\n# Run linting\npnpm lint\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Issue: CLI can't detect framework\nMake sure you're running the `add` command from inside the app directory (`apps/web`), not from the root.\n\n### Issue: Import paths are wrong\nVerify your `components.json` aliases match your actual project structure.\n\n### Issue: Styles not applying\nEnsure your app's CSS file imports the UI package styles and that Tailwind is scanning the UI package:\n\n```css\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n```\n\n---\n\nThis setup gives you a scalable monorepo where multiple apps can share the same UI components from a central `packages/ui` package, with full Turborepo caching benefits and the shadcn/ui CLI handling all the complexity of managing components across workspaces.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":57940},{"type":"message","content":"I'll research how to set up

[\"src/**/*\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Update Your App's Dependencies\n\nIn `apps/web/package.json`, add the UI package as a dependency:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@workspace/ui\": \"workspace:*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Adding Components\n\n### Adding UI Components\n\nRun the `add` command from your **app directory** (e.g., `apps/web`):\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\n\n# Add individual components\nnpx shadcn@canary add button\nnpx shadcn@canary add card\nnpx shadcn@canary add input\n\n# Add multiple components at once\nnpx shadcn@canary add button card input dialog\n\n# Add blocks (pre-built component combinations)\nnpx shadcn@canary add login-01\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- **UI components** (button, card, etc.) → Installed to `packages/ui/src/components/`\n- **Blocks** (login-01, etc.) → Component dependencies go to `packages/ui`, the block itself goes to `apps/web/components/`\n\n---\n\n## Using Components in Your App\n\n### Importing Components\n\n```tsx\n// Import from the shared UI package\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from \"@workspace/ui/components/card\"\n\n// Import hooks\nimport { useToast } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-toast\"\n\n// Import utilities\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n\nexport default function MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <CardHeader>\n        <CardTitle>Welcome</CardTitle>\n      </CardHeader>\n      <CardContent>\n        <Button variant=\"default\">Click me</Button>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration\n\n### `apps/web/app/globals.css`\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Your custom theme variables */\n  --color-background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --color-foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --color-primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n  --color-primary-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);\n  /* ... more CSS variables */\n}\n```\n\n### `packages/ui/src/styles.css`\n\n```css\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Turborepo Configuration\n\n### `turbo.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://turbo.build/schema.json\",\n  \"ui\": \"tui\",\n  \"tasks\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"],\n      \"outputs\": [\".next/**\", \"!.next/cache/**\", \"dist/**\"]\n    },\n    \"dev\": {\n      \"cache\": false,\n      \"persistent\": true\n    },\n    \"lint\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"]\n    },\n    \"typecheck\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\"^build\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `pnpm-workspace.yaml`\n\n```yaml\npackages:\n  - \"apps/*\"\n  - \"packages/*\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **components.json** | Every workspace needs one |\n| **Matching styles** | Same `style`, `iconLibrary`, and `baseColor` in all `components.json` files |\n| **Tailwind v4** | Leave `tailwind` config empty in `components.json` |\n| **Aliases** | Properly define import aliases in each workspace |\n\n---\n\n## Common Commands\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npnpm install\n\n# Start development\npnpm dev\n\n# Build all packages\npnpm build\n\n# Add a new component\ncd apps/web && npx shadcn@canary add [component-name]\n\n# Run type checking\npnpm typecheck\n\n# Run linting\npnpm lint\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Issue: CLI can't detect framework\nMake sure you're running the `add` command from inside the app directory (`apps/web`), not from the root.\n\n### Issue: Import paths are wrong\nVerify your `components.json` aliases match your actual project structure.\n\n### Issue: Styles not applying\nEnsure your app's CSS file imports the UI package styles and that Tailwind is scanning the UI package:\n\n```css\n@import \"@workspace/ui/styles.css\";\n```\n\n---\n\nThis setup gives you a scalable monorepo where multiple apps can share the same UI components from a central `packages/ui` package, with full Turborepo caching benefits and the shadcn/ui CLI handling all the complexity of managing components across workspaces.","timestamp":57940}],"duration":57940,"pass":true,"score":0.98,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Include validation, cleansing, anomaly detection, and deduplication.\n\n5. **Idempotency & Reproducibility**: Design transformations to produce consistent outputs regardless of how many times they run. Use unique keys and maintain execution logs.\n\n6. **Automated Testing**: Employ unit and integration tests for transformations to catch issues early.\n\n## Performance & Scalability\n\n7. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Ensure pipelines can automatically scale computing resources (CPU, memory, storage) during high-demand periods.\n\n8. **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel execution and push-down processing to improve throughput.\n\n9. **Incremental Loading**: Use incremental/delta loading instead of full reloads to update only changed data, improving efficiency.\n\n10. **Real-Time Processing**: Implement streaming capabilities for timely insights where business needs require it.\n\n## Operations & Governance\n\n11. **Robust Error Handling & Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive error handling, real-time monitoring dashboards, and automated alerts for proactive issue resolution.\n\n12. **Externalized Configuration**: Avoid hardcoded values. Use externalized configuration for flexibility, security, and easier deployments.\n\n13. **Version Control**: Apply version control to ETL scripts and processes to track changes and enable rollbacks.\n\n14. **Security & Compliance**: Implement encryption, access controls, and data masking. Ensure alignment with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.\n\n15. **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of workflows, transformations, and data lineage for troubleshooting and onboarding.\n\n16. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks, scheduling, and orchestration to reduce manual errors and improve consistency.","timestamp":25827}],"duration":25827,"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

To convert to pixel coordinates:\n```\npixel_y = (normalized_y / 1000) × image_height\npixel_x = (normalized_x / 1000) × image_width\n```\n\n### 2. **Use Structured System Instructions**\nProvide explicit system instructions that define output constraints:\n```\nReturn bounding boxes as an array with labels.\nNever return masks. Limit to 25 objects.\nIf an object is present multiple times, give each a unique label\nbased on distinct characteristics (size, position, appearance).\n```\n\n### 3. **Enforce JSON Schema Response**\nUse `response_mime_type=\"application/json\"` with a defined `response_schema` to ensure consistent, parseable output—critical for medical imaging pipelines where reliability matters.\n\n### 4. **Medical Imaging-Specific Prompting Strategies**\n\n| Technique | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Anatomical Context** | Include anatomical terminology: *\"Detect and bound all nodular opacities in this chest CT slice\"* |\n| **Modality-Specific Instructions** | Reference the imaging modality: *\"In this MRI T2-weighted sequence, identify hyperintense lesions\"* |\n| **Clinical Specificity** | Be precise: *\"Locate all masses >1cm in the lung parenchyma, excluding vessels\"* |\n| **Negative Constraints** | Specify what NOT to detect: *\"Identify tumors but exclude normal lymph nodes\"* |\n\n### 5. **Few-Shot Prompting with Medical Examples**\nInclude 1-3 annotated examples showing expected bounding box outputs for similar pathologies. Research shows **53% median improvement** over zero-shot prompting with structured few-shot examples (Prompt Triage, 2025).\n\n### 6. **Use MedGemma for Domain-Specific Tasks**\nGoogle's **MedGemma 1.5** (released Jan 2026) is specifically fine-tuned for medical imaging and EHR analysis, offering better out-of-the-box performance for:\n- 3D volumetric data interpretation\n- Multimodal medical datasets\n- Clinical context understanding\n\n### 7. **Temperature and Safety Settings**\nFor medical imaging:\n- **Temperature: 0.2-0.5** (lower for consistent, reproducible detections)\n- **Safety thresholds**: Set to `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH` to avoid over-filtering legitimate medical content\n\n### 8. **Prompt Structure Best Practices**\n\n```python\n# Optimal prompt structure for medical imaging\nsystem_instruction = \"\"\"\nYou are a medical imaging AI assistant specialized in radiology.\nReturn bounding boxes in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format (normalized 0-1000).\nInclude confidence level (high/medium/low) and clinical relevance for each finding.\n\"\"\"\n\nuser_prompt = \"\"\"\n[IMAGE]\nTask: Detect all pulmonary nodules in this chest CT image.\nRequirements:\n- Include nodules ≥3mm in diameter\n- Label each with location (e.g., \"right upper lobe nodule\")\n- Exclude calcified granulomas\n- Provide size estimate category (small/medium/large)\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### 9. **Automated Prompt Optimization (DSPy)**\nRecent research (Nov 2025) shows automated prompt optimization using **DSPy framework** can achieve up to **3,400% improvement** on specific medical imaging tasks. Consider iterative prompt refinement pipelines rather than manual engineering.\n\n### 10. **Bounding Box Constraint Integration**\nFor segmentation tasks, combine bounding boxes with foundation models like **SAM** (Segment Anything Model):\n- Use Gemini for initial bounding box detection\n- Pass boxes as prompts to SAM for precise segmentation\n- Achieves **84.90% Dice score** with limited annotations (2025 research)\n\n### Key Technical Recommendations\n\n1. **Use Gemini 2.5 Flash** for speed-sensitive applications, **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for complex multi-finding detection\n2. **Validate outputs** programmatically—coordinates should fall within [0, 1000] range\n3. **Handle edge cases** in prompts: overlapping structures, partial visibility, artifacts\n4. **Chain-of-thought**: For complex cases, prompt the model to first describe what it sees, then provide bounding boxes\n\n---\n\nThese techniques leverage the latest Vertex AI capabilities while addressing the unique requirements of medical imaging where accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical relevance are paramount.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","timestamp":56557},{"type":"message","content":"I'll research the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026.","timestamp":56557},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":56557},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GQ6CTNkBRc8KGogFhwcDyc","status":"completed","timestamp":56557},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BvUHUYSBo5UXranRLSq6gG","status":"completed","timestamp":56557},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016bRqp1du4PQaHidChkXjYK","status":"completed","timestamp":56557},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":56557},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018LHn8hQme8J48x5VG9KNkd","status":"completed","timestamp":56557},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01P75ZpbaAcW5G1T1bfqRsxd","status":"completed","timestamp":56557},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive research, here are the **best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Best Prompt Engineering Techniques for Bounding Box Detection in Medical Imaging with Vertex AI (2026)\n\n### 1. **Understand the Output Format**\nVertex AI Gemini returns bounding boxes in `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` format with coordinates normalized to **0-1000**.

for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?\nBased on my research, here are the **2026 Android guidelines for handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key Guidelines\n\n### 1. **Edge-to-Edge is Mandatory**\n- Starting **Android 15 (SDK 35)** and enforced in **Android 16 (SDK 36)**, edge-to-edge display is **no longer optional**\n- Apps automatically draw behind system bars (status bar, navigation bar) when targeting SDK 35+\n- The previous opt-out option has been removed in Android 16\n\n### 2. **Inset Types for Navigation & Gestures**\n\n| Inset Type | Use Case |\n|------------|----------|\n| `WindowInsets.systemBars()` | Covers status bar, navigation bar, and caption bar combined |\n| `WindowInsets.navigationBars()` | Navigation bar only (bottom/sides) |\n| `WindowInsets.systemGestures()` | Areas where system intercepts gestures (back gesture on left/right edges, home gesture at bottom) |\n| `WindowInsets.mandatorySystemGestures()` | System gestures that cannot be excluded |\n| `WindowInsets.safeGestures()` | Protects app content from conflicting with system gestures |\n| `WindowInsets.safeDrawing()` | Protects content from being drawn under system UI |\n\n### 3. **Implementation Approaches**\n\n**For Views:**\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures())\n    v.updatePadding(insets.left, insets.top, insets.right, insets.bottom)\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n**For Jetpack Compose:**\n```kotlin\nModifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.systemGestures)\n// Or use safeDrawingPadding() / safeGesturesPadding()\n```\n\n### 4. **Best Practices**\n- **Don't place interactive elements** under navigation bar or in gesture zones\n- Use `WindowInsets.systemGestures()` for swipeable content (bottom sheets, carousels, ViewPager2)\n- For gesture navigation: left/right edges have **back gesture insets**, bottom has **home gesture inset**\n- Use `View.setSystemGestureExclusionRects()` sparingly to opt out of specific gesture areas\n- Material 3 components (BottomAppBar, BottomNavigationView, etc.) handle insets automatically\n- Call `enableEdgeToEdge()` in `onCreate()` for backward compatibility with pre-Android 15 devices","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture

targeting SDK 35+\n- The previous opt-out option has been removed in Android 16\n\n### 2. **Inset Types for Navigation & Gestures**\n\n| Inset Type | Use Case |\n|------------|----------|\n| `WindowInsets.systemBars()` | Covers status bar, navigation bar, and caption bar combined |\n| `WindowInsets.navigationBars()` | Navigation bar only (bottom/sides) |\n| `WindowInsets.systemGestures()` | Areas where system intercepts gestures (back gesture on left/right edges, home gesture at bottom) |\n| `WindowInsets.mandatorySystemGestures()` | System gestures that cannot be excluded |\n| `WindowInsets.safeGestures()` | Protects app content from conflicting with system gestures |\n| `WindowInsets.safeDrawing()` | Protects content from being drawn under system UI |\n\n### 3. **Implementation Approaches**\n\n**For Views:**\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures())\n    v.updatePadding(insets.left, insets.top, insets.right, insets.bottom)\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n**For Jetpack Compose:**\n```kotlin\nModifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.systemGestures)\n// Or use safeDrawingPadding() / safeGesturesPadding()\n```\n\n### 4. **Best Practices**\n- **Don't place interactive elements** under navigation bar or in gesture zones\n- Use `WindowInsets.systemGestures()` for swipeable content (bottom sheets, carousels, ViewPager2)\n- For gesture navigation: left/right edges have **back gesture insets**, bottom has **home gesture inset**\n- Use `View.setSystemGestureExclusionRects()` sparingly to opt out of specific gesture areas\n- Material 3 components (BottomAppBar, BottomNavigationView, etc.) handle insets automatically\n- Call `enableEdgeToEdge()` in `onCreate()` for backward compatibility with pre-Android 15 devices","timestamp":43220}],"duration":43220,"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Edge-to-Edge is Mandatory (SDK 35+)\n- Apps targeting SDK 35 or later have **edge-to-edge enforced by default**\n- System status bar and gesture navigation bars are **transparent**\n- Three-button navigation bar is **translucent**\n- Call `enableEdgeToEdge()` for backwards compatibility on earlier versions\n\n### 2. Inset Types to Handle\n- **System bar insets**: For UI that is tappable and shouldn't be obscured by system bars\n- **System gesture insets**: For OS gesture-navigational areas that take priority over your app\n- **Display cutout insets**: For device areas extending into the display (e.g., camera cutout)\n\n### 3. Navigation Bar Gesture Considerations\n- **Avoid tap gestures or drag targets under system insets** – these conflict with edge-to-edge and gesture navigation\n- For **gesture navigation**: Keep transparent, no additional scrim needed\n- For **three-button navigation**: Add system bar scrim when bottom app bar animates away\n- Bottom app bars should **collapse while scrolling**\n\n### 4. Handling Gesture Conflicts\n- Use `View.setSystemGestureExclusionRects()` to exclude specific areas from back gesture (inward swipe from edges)\n- Use `WindowInsets.getMandatorySystemGestureInsets()` to understand home/quick-switch gesture thresholds\n- Support **predictive back gesture** (introduced in Android 13, ongoing rollout)\n\n### 5. Compose Implementation\nUse inset padding modifiers:\n- `Modifier.safeDrawingPadding()` – applies safe drawing insets\n- `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.systemBars)` – for system bar padding\n- `Modifier.imePadding()` – for keyboard insets\n- Inset size modifiers: `windowInsetsBottomHeight()`, `windowInsetsTopHeight()`, etc.\n\n### 6. System Bar Protection\n- For translucent status bars: Create custom gradient composable overlapping main content\n- For transparent gesture nav: Use default `enableEdgeToEdge()`\n- For three-button nav translucency: Set `Window.setNavigationBarContrastEnforced = true`\n- Match gradient protection colors to each pane's background for adaptive layouts","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","timestamp":49655},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":49655},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012ovjJwQ9axeUtjDJharPSv","status":"completed","timestamp":49655},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":49655},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01JQCGXHmystW4BAX8bb8ahy","status":"completed","timestamp":49655},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01X5RQ4jLCSaMJCrX4gauEB8","status":"completed","timestamp":49655},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017TDgWYnbHX87avdT1cMeY6","status":"completed","timestamp":49655},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019swNvLCcwDomL8t8Djx5ij","status":"completed","timestamp":49655},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the official Android documentation (updated as of January 2026), here are the **2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key Guidelines\n\n### 1.

apps **cannot** opt out of these.\n\n### 6. **Jetpack Compose Implementation**\n\n```kotlin\n// Basic approach\nBox(Modifier.safeDrawingPadding()) { /* content */ }\n\n// Fine-grained control\nModifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.systemGestures)\nModifier.imePadding() // For keyboard\n```\n\nUse padding modifiers (`windowInsetsPadding`, `safeDrawingPadding`) and size modifiers (`windowInsetsBottomHeight`, etc.) to properly handle insets at the component level.","timestamp":42883}],"duration":42883,"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

.NET 4.8 managed cryptography classes no longer throw `CryptographicException` in FIPS mode\n  - Better cryptography support and updated security protocols\n- **Vulnerability Fixes**: Many security patches accumulated between 4.5.2 (2014) and 4.8 (2019)\n\n### 5. **Runtime and CLR Improvements**\n- Both use CLR 4, but 4.8 includes internal optimizations\n- Better handling of edge cases and stability improvements\n\n### 6. **ASP.NET Improvements**\n- Better WebForms handling (e.g., `InputAttributes` and `LabelAttributes` preserved after postback)\n- Improved compatibility with modern web standards\n\n### 7. **OS Support**\n| Version | Latest Supported Windows |\n|---------|-------------------------|\n| 4.5.2 | Windows 10 (limited) |\n| 4.8 | Windows 10/11, Server 2019/2022 |\n\n### 8. **Support Status (2025)**\n- **.NET Framework 4.5.2**: End of support (April 2022) - no longer receiving security updates\n- **.NET Framework 4.8/4.8.1**: Still supported - receives security and reliability updates as long as the underlying Windows version is supported\n\n### Important Notes\n- **.NET Framework 4.8 is the final version** - Microsoft has shifted focus to the modern **.NET** platform (currently .NET 9)\n- 4.8 maintains **backward compatibility** with applications built on 4.5.2\n- For new projects, Microsoft recommends using modern **.NET** (cross-platform, open-source, actively developed)\n\n**Recommendation**: If you're running legacy applications on 4.5.2, upgrading to 4.8 or 4.8.1 is strongly recommended for security updates and improved performance, especially since 4.5.2 is no longer supported.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the differences between .NET Framework 4.5.2 and the latest version of 4.8 in 2025?","timestamp":31294},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":31294},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019SBoBJF8rLs4g5hNUzfc7P","status":"completed","timestamp":31294},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here are the key differences between **.NET Framework 4.5.2** and **.NET Framework 4.8** (the latest and final version of .NET Framework):\n\n## Key Differences Between .NET Framework 4.5.2 and 4.8\n\n### 1. **Performance Improvements**\n- **JIT Compilation**: .NET 4.8 has optimized Just-In-Time compilation for better runtime performance\n- **Garbage Collection**: Enhanced garbage collection algorithms for improved memory management\n- **Overall Application Responsiveness**: Better resource management and faster execution\n\n### 2. **Windows Forms Enhancements**\n- **High DPI Support**: .NET 4.8 introduced proper high DPI awareness and per-monitor DPI scaling\n- **Improved Accessibility**: Better support for accessibility features (screen readers, UI automation)\n- **Updated Controls**: Enhanced control rendering on modern displays\n\n### 3. **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Updates**\n- **Improved Text Rendering**: Better ClearType and text clarity\n- **High DPI Improvements**: Better scaling support for WPF applications\n- **New Controls**: Support for newer UI patterns\n\n### 4. **Security Enhancements**\n- **Cryptography Updates**: \n  -
