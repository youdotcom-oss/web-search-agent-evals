{"id":"websearch-965","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026\nPy\nTorch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing due to issues with how child\n processes are created and how resources are shared. Here are the most common causes and their solutions for 2026:\n\n###\n 1. Set the Multiprocessing Start Method to 'spawn'\n\nThe most frequent cause of deadlocks is the default\n `fork` start method on Unix-like systems. Child processes created with `fork` inherit the parent's entire\n state, including any locks, which can lead to conflicts.\n\n**Solution**: Set the start method to `spawn` at\n the beginning of your main script. This starts a fresh Python interpreter for each child process.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\n.multiprocessing as mp\n\ndef main():\n    # Your PyTorch code here\n    pass\n\nif __name__ ==\n '__main__':\n    # Use 'spawn' for a clean start\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn',\n force=True)\n    main()\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Limit OpenMP/MKL Threads in Worker\n Processes\n\nPyTorch uses libraries like OpenMP and MKL for CPU operations, and these can create their own threads.\n A high number of threads in each worker can lead to resource contention and deadlocks.\n\n**Solution**: Limit the number of threads used\n by these libraries in each worker process by setting `torch.set_num_threads(1)`.\n\n\n```python\n\nimport torch\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset\n\nclass MyDataset(Dataset):\n    def __getitem\n__(self, index):\n        # Set thread count in each worker\n        torch.set_num_threads(1)\n\n        # Your data loading logic here\n        return torch.randn(10)\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        \nreturn 100\n\ndef main():\n    dataset = MyDataset()\n    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch\n_size=4, num_workers=4)\n    # ...\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Load Models\n and Data Within Worker Processes\n\nLoading models or large datasets in the parent process before starting multiprocessing can cause issues with shared resources.\n\n\n**Solution**:\n\n*   **Load Models in Workers**: If each worker needs its own model instance, load the model\n or its `state_dict()` inside the worker function or `Dataset`'s `__init__`.\n*   \n**Avoid Global Initialization**: Ensure that any global variables or CUDA initializations are guarded by `if __name__ == '__main__':\n` to prevent them from running in child processes.\n\n### 4. Isolate the Problem by Disabling Multiprocessing\n\nTo\n confirm that the deadlock is related to multiprocessing, you can temporarily disable it for debugging.\n\n**Solution**: Set `num_workers=\n0` in your `DataLoader`. If the deadlock disappears, you can then apply the solutions above.\n\n\n```python\n#\n For debugging purposes\ndataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, num_workers=0)\n\n```\n\n\nBy implementing\n these strategies, you can effectively resolve deadlocks and ensure smooth model loading with PyTorch's multiprocessing features.","hint":"A correct answer should explain that PyTorch multiprocessing deadlocks when loading models are typically caused by using the default `fork` start method with background threads / CUDA, and must mention switching to a safe start method like `'spawn'` or `'forkserver'` and/or following PyTorch’s multiprocessing best practices (e.g., guarding code with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`, avoiding problematic queues/threads, or using `DistributedDataParallel` instead of manual multiprocessing) as the primary fix.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","timestamp":44378},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":44378},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770374678169-04e5ceb4e339b8","status":"completed","timestamp":44378},{"type":"message","content":"Py","timestamp":44378},{"type":"message","content":"Torch model loading can get stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing due to issues with how child","timestamp":44378},{"type":"message","content":" processes are created and how resources are shared.

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:\n\n\n\n```bash\ncd <your-project-name>\nnpm install\n```\n\n\n### 2.

The best choice will depend on your specific use case, but\n these are the models and families of models to watch:\n\n**1. Models Highly Optimized for MLX & Apple Silicon:**\n\n\n*   **MLX-Native Models:** Expect the `MLX-Embeddings` package and the MLX Community\n on Hugging Face to be the primary sources for the most performant models. Models from architectures like **XLM-Ro\nBERTa**, **BERT**, and **Qwen** are already available and will likely see continued optimization and new, more powerful\n additions.\n*   **Apple-Optimized Models:** Keep an eye out for any models released or highlighted by Apple specifically for\n the MLX framework.\n\n**2. High-Performing General-Purpose Embedding Models:**\n\nThese models are currently leaders in performance\n benchmarks and are likely to be well-supported on MLX by November 2025:\n\n*   **Coh\nere Embed v3:** A top performer for RAG and semantic search, with strong multilingual capabilities.\n*   **Open\nAI `text-embedding-3` Series:** The `small` and `large` versions of these models are very\n popular and performant. `text-embedding-3-large` is particularly powerful for complex tasks.\n*   \n**Microsoft E5 Family:** Known for their excellent performance in multilingual semantic search.\n*   **Sentence-BERT and\n its Successors:** These models are a standard for sentence similarity and semantic search and will likely continue to be a popular choice.\n\n\n**3. Multimodal Embedding Models:**\n\nWith the M4 Max's capabilities, multimodal models that handle both text and images\n will be very effective:\n\n*   **CLIP (and its derivatives):** The ability to embed images and text in\n the same space makes CLIP and similar models ideal for multimodal search and other applications that combine text and vision.\n\n### **Key Factors\n for Your Choice in November 2025**\n\n*   **Your Specific Task:** The best model for you\n will depend on whether you are doing semantic search, RAG, multilingual search, or multimodal tasks.\n*   **Performance\n vs. Size:** While the M4 Max can handle large models, smaller models will still be faster and use less memory\n, which may be important for your application.\n*   **Community Support and Updates:** Check the MLX Community on Hug\nging Face and the `MLX-Embeddings` package for the latest models and performance benchmarks.\n\nIn summary, as\n of November 2025, you should look to the MLX community for the most optimized models and consider the leading\n general-purpose and multimodal models from providers like Cohere, OpenAI, and Microsoft for your specific needs.","hint":"A good answer should name several concrete embedding models known to run well with MLX on Apple Silicon (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding variants, Gemma 3–based embeddings, BERT/RoBERTa/XLM-R style encoders adapted to MLX, or community MLX-embedding models like those used in `mlx-retrieval` or `qwen3-embeddings-mlx`) and clearly state that these are current as of late 2025 while considering M4 Max hardware constraints (throughput, quantization/bit‑width, and memory use). It should briefly compare tradeoffs (model size/throughput vs. embedding quality) or use-cases (RAG/retrieval vs. general semantic search) rather than just listing model names.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best embedding models for MLX on Apple Silicon M4 Max as of November 2025?","timestamp":50866},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":50866},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1770374679856-29e3c81dd4bca8","status":"completed","timestamp":50866},{"type":"message","content":"Based on current trends and the capabilities of Apple Silicon,","timestamp":50866},{"type":"message","content":" here are the likely best embedding models for MLX on an M4 Max in November 2025:\n\n","timestamp":50866},{"type":"message","content":"### **Top Contenders for Best Embedding Models**\n\nGiven the power of the M4 Max and the MLX framework,","timestamp":50866},{"type":"message","content":" you can expect to run sophisticated models locally with high performance.
