Here's how to use it:\n\n### Method 1: Numerical Scaling (Image › Scale Image)\n\n1. Go to **Image › Scale Image** in the top menu\n2. In the Scale Image dialog, you'll see Width and Height fields\n3. **Click the chain icon** between the width and height values to lock it\n4. When the chain is linked/locked, changing one dimension (width or height) will automatically adjust the other proportionally\n5. This prevents distortion and maintains the original aspect ratio\n6. Enter your desired dimension, and the other will adjust automatically\n7. Click **Scale** to apply\n\n### Method 2: Using the Scale Tool (Manual Dragging)\n\n1. Activate the Scale Tool: **Tools › Transform Tools › Scale** or press **Shift + S**\n2. Click on your image to show scaling handles\n3. When dragging manually:\n   - **Hold Shift** while dragging a corner handle to maintain proportions\n   - Hold Ctrl to resize from the center\n\n### Key Points\n\n- The chain icon must be **clicked/linked** (connected) to lock the aspect ratio\n- If the chain is broken/unlinked, you can resize width and height independently, which may distort your image\n- For best quality when scaling, choose **Cubic or NoHalo** interpolation under Quality settings\n\nThe chain icon is your primary tool for preventing image distortion during resizing operations in GIMP.\n\nSources:\n- [How to Resize an Image in GIMP for Web, Print, or Social Media](https://pixpretty.tenorshare.ai/editing/how-to-resize-an-image-in-gimp.html)\n- [How to Resize and Compress Images in GIMP and Photoshop](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/resize-compress-images-in-photoshop-gimp/)\n- [GIMP Scale Tool Simply Explained](https://www.tutkit.com/en/text-tutorials/16824-gimp-scale-tool-simply-explained)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about using the chain icon in GIMP to maintain aspect ratio when scaling images.","timestamp":26020},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":26020},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012QBghhJ9JDqWZi31Kh6WoV","status":"completed","timestamp":26020},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed content from one of these recent articles:","timestamp":26020},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":26020},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012J5GXbk5PJamPeuKWBkN8x","status":"completed","timestamp":26020},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here's how to use the chain icon in GIMP to keep the aspect ratio when scaling an image in 2026:\n\n## Using the Chain Icon to Maintain Aspect Ratio\n\nWhen scaling an image in GIMP, the **chain icon** acts as a lock that links the width and height dimensions together.

Inline Check Suppression**\n\nYou can suppress individual checks directly in your Terraform code using inline comments:\n\n```terraform\n#tfsec:ignore:<check-id>\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n}\n```\n\nFor multiple checks on the same resource:\n\n```terraform\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-versioning\n#tfsec:ignore:aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\n**2. Command-Line Skip Checks**\n\nSkip checks for entire runs:\n\n```bash\n# Skip specific checks\ntfsec . --skip-check CKV_AWS_20\n\n# Skip checks with patterns\ntfsec . --skip-check CKV_AWS*\n\n# Run only specific checks\ntfsec . --check CKV_AWS_20,CKV_AWS_57\n```\n\n**3. Configuration File (.tfsec/config.yml)**\n\nCreate a centralized configuration file to manage exceptions across your project:\n\n```yaml\n---\nexclude:\n  - CKV_AWS_20\n  - CKV_AWS_145\n```\n\n### For **Checkov**\n\n**1. Inline Suppression (Terraform)**\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:The bucket is a public static content host\n  bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n  acl    = \"public-read\"\n}\n```\n\nFor multiple checks:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"main\" {\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:Reason for skip\n  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_145:Another reason\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n}\n```\n\n**2. CloudFormation Metadata**\n\n```yaml\nResources:\n  MyDB:\n    Metadata:\n      checkov:\n        skip:\n          - id: \"CKV_AWS_157\"\n            comment: \"Ensure that RDS instances have Multi-AZ enabled\"\n    Type: \"AWS::RDS::DBInstance\"\n    Properties:\n      DBName: \"mydb\"\n```\n\n**3. Command-Line Skip Checks**\n\n```bash\n# Skip specific check\ncheckov -d . --skip-check CKV_AWS_20\n\n# Skip check patterns\ncheckov -d . --skip-check CKV_AWS*\n\n# Skip by severity (requires API key)\ncheckov -d . --skip-check MEDIUM --bc-api-key <api-key>\n\n# Run specific checks\ncheckov --directory . --check CKV_AWS_20,CKV_AWS_57\n```\n\n**4. Baseline File Management**\n\nCheckov supports creating a baseline to skip existing issues:\n\n```bash\n# Create baseline\ncheckov -d . --create-baseline\n\n# Run with baseline\ncheckov -d . --baseline <baseline-file>\n```\n\n**5. Package Manager-Specific Suppressions (SCA)**\n\nFor Python (requirements.txt):\n```python\n# checkov:skip=CVE-2019-19844: ignore CVE for all packages\n# checkov:skip=jinja2[BC_LIC_1]: ignore license violations\ndjango==1.2\n```\n\nFor package.json:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-package\",\n  \"//\": [\"checkov:skip=express[BC_LIC_2]: ignore license violations\",\n         \"checkov:skip=CVE-2023-123: ignore CVE\"]\n}\n```\n\n### **Best Practices for Production (2026)**\n\n**1. Centralized Exception Management**\n- Maintain a central configuration repository for all baseline exceptions\n- Document the reason for each exception with ticket/issue references\n- Implement expiration dates for temporary exceptions\n\n**2. Exception Review Process**\n- Schedule quarterly reviews of all exceptions\n- Require security team approval for critical/high severity exceptions\n- Automatically notify stakeholders when exceptions are added\n\n**3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration**\n\nFor GitHub Actions:\n```yaml\n- name: tfsec\n  uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0\n  with:\n    soft_fail: true\n    \n- name: Checkov\n  uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master\n  with:\n    skip_check: CKV_AWS_20,CKV_AWS_145\n```\n\n**4. Policy as Code**\n- Use enforcement rules with severity thresholds\n- Combine platform enforcement rules with local skip configurations\n- Implement hard-fail for critical issues, soft-fail for lower severities\n\n**5. Monitoring and Reporting**\n- Track exception metrics over time\n- Generate regular reports showing:\n  - Number of active exceptions\n  - Age of exceptions\n  - Exceptions by severity\n  - Trend analysis\n\n**6. Environment-Specific Exceptions**\n- Use different baseline files for dev/staging/production\n- Apply stricter policies in production\n- Allow more flexibility in development environments\n\n**7. Integration with Spacelift or Similar Platforms**\n- Leverage custom inputs for security tool integration\n- Use Policy as Code features\n- Implement automated exception workflows\n\n### **Migration to Trivy (2026 Consideration)**\n\nNote that tfsec has been integrated into Trivy, so consider migrating:\n\n```bash\n# Use Trivy for Terraform scanning\ntrivy config .\n```\n\nThis provides a unified tool for IaC, container, and dependency scanning.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Checkov - Suppressing and Skipping Policies](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html)\n- [Spacelift - What is tfsec?

The app had been using the `overrideConfig` internal API through Shizuku (which allows apps to run as the \"shell\" user with elevated privileges).\n\n**Quick Workaround**: The developer (Kyujin Cho) immediately released version 1.3.0 with a new workaround that \"launders\" the API call through an `Instrumentation` component, bypassing Google's restriction.\n\n## Current Situation (2026)\n\nSince the original vvb2060 repository is now archived, development has likely shifted or ceased.

Version 3.0 uses this new approach.\n\n## How It Works Now (2026)\n\nThe app now:\n1. Requires **Shizuku** running (via Wireless Debugging or root access)\n2. Automatically injects carrier configurations when Shizuku starts\n3. Enables VoLTE, VoWiFi, VoNR, Video Calling, and 5G features\n4.

about Cloudflare Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026.\n\nLet me get more specific information about Workers AI binding patterns and fetch content from the most relevant sources.\n\n\nLet me fetch additional content from the official Cloudflare documentation to get specific binding usage patterns.\n\nBased on my research, here are some key Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026:\n\n## Workers AI Binding Usage Patterns for 2026\n\n### 1. **Basic AI Binding Configuration**\n\nThe fundamental pattern involves configuring the AI binding in your `wrangler.toml` or `wrangler.jsonc`:\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n```\n\nThis makes the AI service available via `env.AI` in your Worker code.\n\n### 2. **Simple Inference Pattern**\n\nBasic model execution with LLMs:\n\n```typescript\nconst response = await env.AI.run(\"@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct\", {\n  prompt: \"What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World\"\n});\n```\n\n### 3. **Streaming Responses Pattern**\n\nFor real-time AI responses, especially important in 2026 with larger models:\n\n```typescript\nconst answer = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {\n  prompt: \"Your question here\",\n  stream: true\n});\n\nreturn new Response(answer, {\n  headers: { \"content-type\": \"text/event-stream\" }\n});\n```\n\n### 4. **Production AI Gateway Pattern**\n\nA comprehensive pattern that includes authentication, model selection, streaming support, and tool calling:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env) {\n    // Parse request with authentication\n    const { messages, tools, stream, model } = await request.json();\n    \n    // Construct AI payload\n    const aiPayload = {\n      messages,\n      stream: stream === true,\n    };\n    if (Array.isArray(tools) && tools.length > 0) {\n      aiPayload.tools = tools;\n    }\n    \n    const modelToUse = model || DEFAULT_MODEL;\n    \n    // Run AI model\n    const aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, aiPayload);\n    \n    // Handle streaming vs non-streaming responses\n    if (aiPayload.stream === true) {\n      return new Response(aiResult, {\n        headers: {\n          \"Content-Type\": \"text/event-stream;charset=utf-8\",\n          \"Cache-Control\": \"no-cache, no-transform\",\n        },\n      });\n    }\n    \n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(aiResult), {\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json;charset=utf-8\" }\n    });\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 5. **Multi-Model Pattern (2026)**\n\nWith the new \"Run Any Model\" feature, you can dynamically select models:\n\n- **Static catalog models**: Pre-warmed, guaranteed performance (Llama 3.1 70B, Llama 3.2, FLUX.2)\n- **Dynamic catalog models**: On-demand model execution with cold starts\n\n### 6. **Vision Model Pattern**\n\nNew in 2026 with multi-modal support:\n\n```typescript\nawait env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct', {\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: \"Describe this image\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n### 7. **AI Gateway Integration Pattern**\n\nConnecting Workers AI with AI Gateway for observability:\n\n```typescript\n// Direct binding enables logging, caching, rate limiting\nconst response = await env.AI.run(model, payload);\n// Automatically logged to AI Gateway for analytics\n```\n\n### 8. **Chat/Conversation Pattern**\n\nSupporting multi-turn conversations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\",\n  \"stream\": false,\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a friendly and helpful assistant.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"What is the origin of the pascal programming language?\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 9. **Tool Calling/Function Calling Pattern**\n\nFor building AI agents with function calls:\n\n```typescript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages: [...],\n  tools: [\n    {\n      type: \"function\",\n      function: {\n        name: \"get_weather\",\n        description: \"Get current weather\",\n        parameters: {...}\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n### 10. **Cost-Optimized Pattern**\n\nWith 2026's new pricing model (token-based):\n- Use smaller models (1B-3B) for simpler tasks at $0.10/M tokens\n- Reserve larger models (40B+) at $0.75/M tokens for complex reasoning\n- Leverage the free tier: 10,000 tokens/day\n\n### Key 2026 Improvements:\n\n- **Larger context windows**: Full 128K context support\n- **Faster performance**: 80+ tokens/second, 300ms TTFT\n- **180+ global locations**: Reduced latency worldwide\n- **More powerful GPUs**: Supporting 70B+ parameter models\n- **Simplified pricing**: Token-based instead of

information about Workers AI binding usage patterns and examples.\n\n\nBased on the search results and content I retrieved, here are some examples of Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026:\n\n## Common Workers AI Binding Usage Patterns (2026)\n\n### 1. **AI Binding Configuration**\nIn your `wrangler.toml`, bind the AI service to your Worker:\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n```\n\nThis makes the AI service available as `env.AI` in your Worker code.\n\n### 2. **Basic Model Invocation Pattern**\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env) {\n    const aiResult = await env.AI.run(\"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\", {\n      messages: [\n        { role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant.\" },\n        { role: \"user\", content: \"What is Pascal?\" }\n      ]\n    });\n    \n    return Response.json(aiResult);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Streaming Response Pattern**\nFor real-time AI responses:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages: messages,\n  stream: true  // Enable streaming\n};\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelName, aiPayload);\n\n// Return as server-sent events\nreturn new Response(aiResult, {\n  headers: {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"text/event-stream;charset=utf-8\",\n    \"Cache-Control\": \"no-cache, no-transform\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### 4. **Dynamic Model Selection Pattern**\nAllow clients to choose which model to use:\n\n```javascript\nconst { messages, model } = await request.json();\nconst DEFAULT_MODEL = \"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\";\nconst modelToUse = model || DEFAULT_MODEL;\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, { messages });\n```\n\n### 5. **Tool Calling / Function Calling Pattern**\nFor building AI agents with function capabilities:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages: messages,\n  tools: [\n    {\n      type: \"function\",\n      function: {\n        name: \"get_weather\",\n        description: \"Get the current weather\",\n        parameters: { /* ... */ }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelName, aiPayload);\n\n// Check for tool calls in response\nif (aiResult.tool_calls && aiResult.tool_calls.length > 0) {\n  // Handle function execution\n}\n```\n\n### 6. **Secure Private Gateway Pattern**\nProduction-ready pattern with authentication:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env) {\n    // Basic auth check\n    const authHeader = request.headers.get(\"Authorization\");\n    // ... validate credentials using timing-safe comparison\n    \n    // Parse request\n    const { messages, tools, stream, model } = await request.json();\n    \n    // Construct AI payload\n    const aiPayload = { messages, stream: stream === true };\n    if (tools) aiPayload.tools = tools;\n    \n    // Call AI with binding\n    const aiResult = await env.AI.run(model, aiPayload);\n    \n    return stream \n      ? new Response(aiResult, { headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"text/event-stream\" }})\n      : Response.json(aiResult);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. **REST API Pattern (Outside Workers)**\nDirect API calls without Workers:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\n\nACCOUNT_ID = os.environ.get(\"CF_ACCOUNT_ID\")\nAPI_TOKEN = os.environ.get(\"CF_API_TOKEN\")\nmodel = \"@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct\"\n\napi_url = f\"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/{model}\"\nheaders = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {API_TOKEN}\"}\n\nresponse = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json={\n    \"prompt\": \"Hello World origin?\"\n})\n```\n\n### Key Features in 2026:\n- **Default models**: Llama 4 Scout (17B) is now a popular default\n- **Streaming support**: Native ReadableStream handling for real-time responses\n- **Tool/Function calling**: Built-in support for agentic AI patterns\n- **Privacy-first**: Data not used for training models\n- **Edge execution**: Models run on Cloudflare's global network for low latency\n- **Pay-per-neuron pricing**: Only pay for actual compute used\n\nSources:\n- [Running AI Models on the Edge

information about Workers AI bindings configuration.\n\n\nBased on my research, here are some key examples of **Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026**:\n\n## Configuration Patterns\n\n### 1. **Basic AI Binding Setup**\nThe fundamental pattern for configuring Workers AI in `wrangler.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"  # Available in your Worker as env.AI\n```\n\nOr in `wrangler.jsonc`:\n```json\n{\n  \"ai\": {\n    \"binding\": \"AI\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Complete Production Configuration**\nA full-featured setup including observability and custom domains:\n\n```toml\nname = \"ai-gateway\"\nmain = \"worker.js\"\ncompatibility_date = \"2025-09-27\"\n\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n\n[observability.logs]\nenabled = true\n\n[[routes]]\npattern = \"ai.yourdomain.com\"\ncustom_domain = true\n```\n\n## Code Usage Patterns\n\n### 3. **Basic Inference Pattern**\nSimple model execution:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Env {\n  AI: Ai;\n}\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {\n    const response = await env.AI.run(\"@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct\", {\n      prompt: \"What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World\"\n    });\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));\n  }\n} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;\n```\n\n### 4. **Streaming Response Pattern**\nFor real-time AI responses:\n\n```typescript\nconst answer = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {\n  prompt: \"What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'\",\n  stream: true\n});\n\nreturn new Response(answer, {\n  headers: { \"content-type\": \"text/event-stream\" }\n});\n```\n\n### 5. **Chat Completion with Tools Pattern**\nAdvanced pattern supporting function calling and tool use:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages: [\n    { role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant.\" },\n    { role: \"user\", content: \"What's the weather?\" }\n  ],\n  stream: false,\n  tools: [\n    {\n      type: \"function\",\n      function: {\n        name: \"get_weather\",\n        description: \"Get current weather\",\n        parameters: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            location: { type: \"string\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(\"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\", aiPayload);\n```\n\n### 6. **Model Selection Pattern**\nDynamic model selection based on client input:\n\n```javascript\nconst DEFAULT_MODEL = \"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\";\nconst modelToUse = requestBody.model || DEFAULT_MODEL;\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, {\n  messages: requestBody.messages,\n  stream:

on my research, here are some key examples of **Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026**:\n\n## Configuration Patterns\n\n### 1. **Basic AI Binding Setup**\nThe fundamental pattern for configuring Workers AI in `wrangler.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"  # Available in your Worker as env.AI\n```\n\nOr in `wrangler.jsonc`:\n```json\n{\n  \"ai\": {\n    \"binding\": \"AI\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Complete Production Configuration**\nA full-featured setup including observability and custom domains:\n\n```toml\nname = \"ai-gateway\"\nmain = \"worker.js\"\ncompatibility_date = \"2025-09-27\"\n\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n\n[observability.logs]\nenabled = true\n\n[[routes]]\npattern = \"ai.yourdomain.com\"\ncustom_domain = true\n```\n\n## Code Usage Patterns\n\n### 3. **Basic Inference Pattern**\nSimple model execution:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Env {\n  AI: Ai;\n}\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {\n    const response = await env.AI.run(\"@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct\", {\n      prompt: \"What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World\"\n    });\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));\n  }\n} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;\n```\n\n### 4. **Streaming Response Pattern**\nFor real-time AI responses:\n\n```typescript\nconst answer = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {\n  prompt: \"What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'\",\n  stream: true\n});\n\nreturn new Response(answer, {\n  headers: { \"content-type\": \"text/event-stream\" }\n});\n```\n\n### 5. **Chat Completion with Tools Pattern**\nAdvanced pattern supporting function calling and tool use:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages: [\n    { role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant.\" },\n    { role: \"user\", content: \"What's the weather?\" }\n  ],\n  stream: false,\n  tools: [\n    {\n      type: \"function\",\n      function: {\n        name: \"get_weather\",\n        description: \"Get current weather\",\n        parameters: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            location: { type: \"string\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(\"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\", aiPayload);\n```\n\n### 6. **Model Selection Pattern**\nDynamic model selection based on client input:\n\n```javascript\nconst DEFAULT_MODEL = \"@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\";\nconst modelToUse = requestBody.model || DEFAULT_MODEL;\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, {\n  messages: requestBody.messages,\n  stream: requestBody.stream === true\n});\n```\n\n### 7. **Authenticated Gateway Pattern**\nProduction-ready API with authentication and CORS:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request, env) {\n    // Basic Auth validation\n    const authHeader = request.headers.get(\"Authorization\");\n    // ... validation logic ...\n    \n    const requestBody = await request.json();\n    const aiResult = await env.AI.run(requestBody.model, {\n      messages: requestBody.messages,\n      tools: requestBody.tools,\n      stream: requestBody.stream\n    });\n    \n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(aiResult), {\n      headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\"\n      }\n    });\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Key Trends for 2026\n\n1. **Privacy-First Design**: Data used for inference is not used to train models\n2. **Function Calling**: Enhanced support for building AI agents with tool use\n3. **Streaming by Default**: Real-time responses via Server-Sent Events\n4. **Multi-Model Support**: Easy switching between 50+ open-source models\n5. **Edge

binding in your `wrangler.toml`:\n\n```toml\nname = \"your-worker\"\nmain = \"worker.js\"\ncompatibility_date = \"2025-09-27\"\n\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n```\n\n## Common Usage Patterns\n\n### 1. **Text Generation with LLMs**\nRunning large language models at the edge for chat and text completion:\n\n```javascript\nconst response = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8', {\n  messages: [\n    { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },\n    { role: 'user', content: userPrompt }\n  ],\n  max_tokens: 256,\n  temperature: 0.7\n});\n```\n\n### 2. **Streaming Responses**\nSupporting real-time streaming for better user experience:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages,\n  stream: true\n};\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, aiPayload);\n\n// Return as text/event-stream\nreturn new Response(aiResult, {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream;charset=utf-8',\n    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### 3. **Dynamic Model Selection**\nAllowing clients to choose models at runtime:\n\n```javascript\nconst modelToUse = model || '@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct';\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, aiPayload);\n```\n\n### 4. **Tool/Function Calling**\nEnabling agent-like behaviors with tool support:\n\n```javascript\nconst aiPayload = {\n  messages,\n  stream: false\n};\n\nif (Array.isArray(tools) && tools.length > 0) {\n  aiPayload.tools = tools;\n}\n\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, aiPayload);\n```\n\n### 5. **Secure AI Gateway Pattern**\nCreating authenticated endpoints with Basic Auth:\n\n```javascript\n// Authentication check\nconst authHeader = request.headers.get(\"Authorization\");\n// Validate credentials using timing-safe comparison\n\n// Then run AI inference\nconst aiResult = await env.AI.run(modelToUse, aiPayload);\n```\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\n### **Hybrid Edge/Regional Execution**\n- Lightweight models (embeddings, classification) run at the edge\n- Heavy models (70B+ LLMs, diffusion models) routed to regional GPU clusters\n- Intelligent routing based on request characteristics\n\n### **Multi-layer Caching**\n- Request-level deduplication\n- Result caching with TTLs\n- Semantic caching based on embedding similarity\n\n### **Chain-of-thought Processing**\n- Initial processing at the edge\n- Routing to specialized compute when needed\n- Final assembly before client response\n\n## Key Considerations for 2026\n\n1. **Model Selection**: Limited to Cloudflare's pre-trained model catalog (Llama, Mistral, Stable Diffusion, etc.)\n2. **Memory Constraints**: Models typically under 10GB for edge deployment\n3. **Global Distribution**: Reduced latency through geographic distribution across Cloudflare's network\n4. **Serverless Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on actual usage without GPU provisioning\n5. **Privacy-first**: Data not used for model training,

The key is creating a shared `ui` package that contains all your shadcn components, which can then be consumed by multiple Next.js apps.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js** v18 or higher\n- **TypeScript** v5 or higher\n- **Next.js** v16\n- **Turbo** v2\n- **pnpm** v10 (or npm/yarn/bun)\n- **Tailwind CSS** v4\n- **shadcn/ui** latest\n\n## Step 1: Create Your Turborepo\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\nThis creates a monorepo with the following structure:\n- `apps/` - Your Next.js applications\n- `packages/` - Shared packages including a `ui` package\n\n## Step 2: Set Up the UI Package\n\nNavigate to your UI package:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\n```\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\n```\n\n### Configure tsconfig.json\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create components.json\n\nCreate `packages/ui/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create Utility Functions\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS v4\n\n### Install Tailwind\n\n```bash\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\n### Create PostCSS Config\n\nCreate `packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create Global Styles\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"tw-animate-css\";\n\n@source \"../../../apps/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../../../packages/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n\n@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));\n\n:root {\n  /* Add your theme variables here */\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Set Up TSUP for Building\n\nThis is critical for proper module resolution:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\nCreate `packages/ui/tsup.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outdir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n### Update Package Scripts\n\nIn `packages/ui/package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:components\": \"tsup\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\",\n    \"dev:components\": \"tsup --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Export Build Files\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/package.json` exports:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./shadcn/ui/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/ui/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/tsup/lib/*.mjs\",\n    \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.mjs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 6: Add shadcn Components\n\nFrom the UI package directory:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\n```\n\n## Step 7: Configure Your Next.js App\n\n### Update next.config.ts\n\nIn `apps/web/next.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: [\"@repo/ui\"]\n};\n\nexport default nextConfig;\n```\n\n### Create PostCSS Config\n\nCreate `apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`:\n\n```javascript\nexport { default } from \"@repo/ui/postcss.config\";\n```\n\n### Update tsconfig.json\n\nIn `apps/web/tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Import Global Styles\n\nIn `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`:\n\n```typescript\nimport \"@repo/ui/globals.css\";\n```\n\n### Create components.json (Optional)\n\nIf you want to add components directly to your app, create `apps/web/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"ui\": \"@repo/ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\"\n  },\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 8: Use Components\n\nIn your Next.js app:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error: Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'\n\n**Solution**: Verify your `tsconfig.json` path aliases and ensure `tsup.config.ts` is properly configured.\n\n### CSS Not Loading\n\n**Solution**: Ensure the `@source` directives in your global CSS include all relevant directories.\n\n### Module Not Found\n\n**Solution**: Run `pnpm run build:components` in the UI package and verify the exports in `package.json`.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **No duplication**: One UI library shared across all apps\n- **Single source of truth**: One Tailwind config for the entire monorepo\n- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support across packages\n- **Easy updates**: Update components in one place\n\nSources:\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI with

\"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error: Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'\n\n**Solution**: Verify your `tsconfig.json` path aliases and ensure `tsup.config.ts` is properly configured.\n\n### CSS Not Loading\n\n**Solution**: Ensure the `@source` directives in your global CSS include all relevant directories.\n\n### Module Not Found\n\n**Solution**: Run `pnpm run build:components` in the UI package and verify the exports in `package.json`.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **No duplication**: One UI library shared across all apps\n- **Single source of truth**: One Tailwind config for the entire monorepo\n- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support across packages\n- **Easy updates**: Update components in one place\n\nSources:\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI with

Create Your Turborepo Project\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\nThis creates a monorepo with:\n- `apps/` - Your applications (web, docs)\n- `packages/` - Shared packages (ui, configs)\n\n### 2. Set Up the UI Package\n\nNavigate to your UI package:\n```bash\ncd packages/ui/\n```\n\n#### Install Tailwind CSS v4\n\n```bash\npnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\n#### Create PostCSS Configuration\n\nCreate `postcss.config.mjs`:\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {},\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Create Global Styles\n\nCreate `src/styles/globals.css`:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"tw-animate-css\";\n\n@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));\n\n:root {\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  /* Add all color variables */\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Configure Path Aliases\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Install shadcn Dependencies\n\n```bash\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\n```\n\n### 5. Create Utility Helper\n\nCreate `src/lib/utils.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { clsx, type ClassValue } from \"clsx\"\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\"\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Configure components.json\n\nCreate `packages/ui/components.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"src/styles.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Set Up TSUP (Critical Step)\n\nThe default `tsc` compiler doesn't handle path aliases correctly in the built output. Use `tsup` instead:\n\n```bash\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\nCreate `tsup.config.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n**Why `outDir: \"dist/tsup\"`?** This prevents conflicts between the CSS build and component build processes running in parallel.\n\n### 8. Update Build Scripts\n\nIn `packages/ui/package.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:components\": \"tsup\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\",\n    \"dev:components\": \"tsup --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9. Export Components\n\nAdd exports to `packages/ui/package.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./styles.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./shadcn/ui/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/ui/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/lib/*.mjs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 10. Add shadcn Components\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\n```\n\n### 11. Configure Your Next.js App\n\nIn `apps/web/tsconfig.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn `apps/web/next.config.ts`:\n```typescript\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: [\"@repo/ui\"],\n};\n\nexport default nextConfig;\n```\n\nCreate `apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`:\n```javascript\nexport { default } from \"@repo/ui/postcss.config\";\n```\n\nIn `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`:\n```typescript\nimport '@repo/ui/globals.css';\n```\n\n### 12. Use Components\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button\"\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Error: Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'**\n- Verify path aliases in `tsconfig.json`\n- Ensure `tsup` is configured correctly\n\n**Error: Components have improper styling**\n- Make sure `@import \"@repo/tailwind-config\"` is in your CSS files\n- Check that Tailwind scans the UI package path\n\n**CSS file keeps deleting**\n- Use `outDir: \"dist/tsup\"` in tsup config\n- This separates component builds from CSS builds\n\n## Key Differences from Previous Approaches\n\n1. **Tailwind v4** uses `@import \"tailwindcss\"` instead of traditional config files\n2. **TSUP** is essential for proper path alias resolution in monorepos\n3. **Separation of build outputs** prevents conflicts in watch mode\n4. **Manual configuration** is more reliable than using shadcn CLI in monorepos\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Add more components: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`\n- Customize themes using [tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com/)\n- Create custom components in `packages/ui/src/components`\n- Share utility functions via `packages/ui/src/lib`\n\nSources:\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI with Turborepo](https://medium.com/techtrends-digest/the-complete-guide-to-shadcn-ui-and-turborepo-integration-efd41efeed31)\n- [How to Implement Shadcn UI with Tailwind v4 in a Turborepo](https://medium.com/@soumyadipdutta1004/how-to-implement-shadcn-in-a-turborepo-b7853c65e699)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo with current 2026 guidance.","timestamp":41744},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":41744},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01L68LRhyyo1g9soZZF95MwJ","status":"completed","timestamp":41744},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed content from the most relevant and recent guides:","timestamp":41744},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":41744},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CYDCxBFq8cGoyJQdRFyz8Z","status":"completed","timestamp":41744},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest 2026 tutorials, here's a comprehensive guide for setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo:\n\n## Setting Up shadcn UI in Turborepo Monorepo - 2026 Guide\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Node.js v18+\n- TypeScript v5+\n- pnpm v10 (recommended)\n- Turborepo v2\n- Tailwind CSS v4\n- Next.js v16\n\n### 1.

This prevents duplication across multiple apps and maintains a single source of truth.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js v18+\n- TypeScript v5+\n- Turbo v2\n- pnpm v10 (recommended)\n- Tailwind CSS v4\n- Next.js v16 (for apps)\n\n## Step 1: Create Your Turborepo\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\nThis creates a monorepo with:\n- `apps/` - Contains your applications (web, docs, etc.)\n- `packages/` - Contains shared packages including `ui`\n\n## Step 2: Set Up the UI Package\n\nNavigate to your UI package:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\n```\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\n# Tailwind v4 and PostCSS\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n\n# Shadcn dependencies\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\n\n# Build tool\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n### Configure TypeScript (`packages/ui/tsconfig.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configure PostCSS (`packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`)\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create Global Styles (`packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`)\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"tw-animate-css\";\n\n/* Tell Tailwind what to scan */\n@source \"../../../../apps/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../../../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n\n@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));\n\n:root {\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  /* ... add all color variables ... */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* ... dark mode variables ... */\n}\n\n@theme inline {\n  --color-background: var(--background);\n  /* ... map all variables ... */\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border outline-ring/50;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create Utility Function (`packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { clsx, type ClassValue } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n### Create components.json (`packages/ui/components.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configure tsup for Building (`packages/ui/tsup.config.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n### Update Package Scripts (`packages/ui/package.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.mjs\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/tsup/lib/*.mjs\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./dist/tsup/hooks/*.mjs\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:components\": \"tsup\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\",\n    \"dev:components\": \"tsup --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Add shadcn Components\n\nFrom within `packages/ui`:\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\n```\n\nThis installs components into `packages/ui/src/components/ui/`.\n\n## Step 4: Set Up Next.js Apps\n\n### Update next.config.ts (`apps/web/next.config.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: [\"@repo/ui\"]\n};\n\nexport default nextConfig;\n```\n\n### Create PostCSS Config (`apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`)\n\n```javascript\nexport { default } from \"@repo/ui/postcss.config\";\n```\n\n### Update TypeScript Config (`apps/web/tsconfig.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create components.json (`apps/web/components.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@repo/ui/components\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Import Global Styles (`apps/web/app/layout.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport \"@repo/ui/globals.css\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Use Components\n\nIn your Next.js app:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n## Key Differences with Tailwind v4\n\n1. **No tailwind.config.js** - Configuration is done directly in CSS using `@source`, `@theme`, and other directives\n2. **Single CSS file** - The `globals.css` file acts as both config and stylesheet\n3. **PostCSS plugin** - Uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of the old setup\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error: Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'\n- Verify path aliases in `tsconfig.json`\n- Ensure `tsup` is properly configured\n- Check that `tsup.config.ts` includes the correct paths\n\n### Components have no styling\n- Ensure `globals.css` is imported in your app's layout\n- Verify the `@source` directives include all relevant paths\n- Run `pnpm run build:components` in the UI package\n\n### Module not found errors\n- Add the package to dependencies in your app's `package.json`\n- Ensure `transpilePackages` includes `@repo/ui` in `next.config.ts`\n- Run `pnpm install` at the root\n\n## Benefits of This Approach\n\n- **Zero duplication** - Components defined once, used everywhere\n- **Single source of truth** - One Tailwind config, one style system\n- **Better performance** - Shared components reduce bundle size\n- **Easier maintenance** - Update once, deploy everywhere\n- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support across packages\n\n## Sources\n\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI with

How to Set Up shadcn UI in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Tutorial)\n\nBased on the latest 2026 guidance, here's a comprehensive guide for setting up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo with Tailwind v4:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe modern approach is to create a **shared UI package** (`packages/ui`) that contains all shadcn components, Tailwind configuration, and styles. This prevents duplication across multiple apps and maintains a single source of truth.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js v18+\n- TypeScript v5+\n- Turbo v2\n- pnpm v10 (recommended)\n- Tailwind CSS v4\n- Next.js v16 (for apps)\n\n## Step 1: Create Your Turborepo\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\nThis creates a monorepo with:\n- `apps/` - Contains your applications (web, docs, etc.)\n- `packages/` - Contains shared packages including `ui`\n\n## Step 2: Set Up the UI Package\n\nNavigate to your UI package:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\n```\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\n# Tailwind v4 and PostCSS\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n\n# Shadcn dependencies\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\n\n# Build tool\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n### Configure TypeScript (`packages/ui/tsconfig.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configure PostCSS (`packages/ui/postcss.config.mjs`)\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n  plugins: {\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create Global Styles (`packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`)\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"tw-animate-css\";\n\n/* Tell Tailwind what to scan */\n@source \"../../../../apps/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n@source \"../../../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\";\n\n@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));\n\n:root {\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  /* ... add all color variables ... */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* ... dark mode variables ... */\n}\n\n@theme inline {\n  --color-background: var(--background);\n  /* ... map all variables ... */\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border outline-ring/50;\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create Utility Function (`packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { clsx, type ClassValue } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n### Create components.json (`packages/ui/components.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true,\n    \"prefix\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configure tsup for Building (`packages/ui/tsup.config.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n### Update Package Scripts (`packages/ui/package.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.mjs\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/tsup/lib/*.mjs\",\n    \"./hooks/*\": \"./dist/tsup/hooks/*.mjs\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:components\": \"tsup\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\",\n    \"dev:components\": \"tsup --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Add shadcn Components\n\nFrom within `packages/ui`:\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\n```\n\nThis installs components into `packages/ui/src/components/ui/`.\n\n## Step 4: Set Up Next.js Apps\n\n### Update next.config.ts (`apps/web/next.config.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: [\"@repo/ui\"]\n};\n\nexport default nextConfig;\n```\n\n### Create PostCSS Config (`apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`)\n\n```javascript\nexport { default } from \"@repo/ui/postcss.config\";\n```\n\n### Update TypeScript Config (`apps/web/tsconfig.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create components.json (`apps/web/components.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"../../packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"utils\": \"@repo/ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@repo/ui/components\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Import Global Styles (`apps/web/app/layout.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport \"@repo/ui/globals.css\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Use Components\n\nIn your Next.js app:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/components/button\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n```\n\n## Key Differences with Tailwind v4\n\n1. **No tailwind.config.js** - Configuration is done directly in CSS using `@source`, `@theme`, and other directives\n2. **Single CSS file** - The `globals.css` file acts as both config and stylesheet\n3. **PostCSS plugin** - Uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of the old setup\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error: Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'\n- Verify path aliases in `tsconfig.json`\n- Ensure `tsup` is properly configured\n- Check that `tsup.config.ts` includes the correct paths\n\n### Components have no styling\n- Ensure `globals.css` is imported in your app's layout\n- Verify the `@source` directives include all relevant paths\n- Run `pnpm run build:components` in the UI package\n\n### Module not found errors\n- Add the package to dependencies in your app's `package.json`\n- Ensure `transpilePackages` includes `@repo/ui` in `next.config.ts`\n- Run `pnpm install` at the root\n\n## Benefits of This Approach\n\n- **Zero duplication** - Components defined once, used everywhere\n- **Single source of truth** - One Tailwind config, one style system\n- **Better performance** - Shared components reduce bundle size\n- **Easier maintenance** - Update once, deploy everywhere\n- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support across packages\n\n## Sources\n\n- [The Complete Guide to Integrating Shadcn UI with

ELT Over ETL**\n- Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) has become the standard approach in 2025\n- Raw data is loaded first into cloud warehouses, then transformed using native compute\n- Offers better scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency than traditional ETL\n- Aligns with modern tools like dbt for transformation workflows\n\n**2. Cloud Warehouse/Lakehouse as Central Hub**\n- Use platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks as the central data hub\n- Leverage native compute power for complex transformations\n- Supports diverse use cases: analytics, ML, and real-time reporting\n\n**3. Hybrid Batch & Stream Processing**\n- Support both batch and real-time data processing within the same framework\n- Use event-driven architecture with tools like Kafka for real-time needs\n- Implement exactly-once semantics for transactional pipelines\n\n### Core Implementation Practices\n\n**4. Modular & Microservices Design**\n- Break ETL processes into smaller, reusable components\n- Each stage (extract, transform, load) can be developed and scaled independently\n- Improves maintainability, troubleshooting, and code reuse\n\n**5. Incremental Processing**\n- Use incremental loading for large datasets to minimize processing time\n- Only process new or updated records to reduce compute costs\n- Implement data filtering at the source\n\n**6. Granular Data Control**\n- Extract only necessary data fields and entities\n- Implement field-level mapping and filtering\n- Reduce data volumes and improve performance\n\n### Data Quality & Governance\n\n**7. Data Quality Framework**\n- Implement comprehensive data quality checks and validation\n- Use declarative constraints (e.g., \"no nulls allowed\")\n- Build automated anomaly detection using statistical thresholds or ML\n- Integrate tools like Great Expectations or dbt tests\n\n**8. Data Contracts**\n- Define explicit agreements between data producers and consumers\n- Specify schema, freshness, and reliability expectations\n- Prevent silent breakages and enable faster debugging\n\n**9. Extensive Logging & Monitoring**\n- Maintain detailed logs of data sources, transformations, and errors\n- Use structured logging for easier analysis\n- Track metrics: latency, throughput, failure rates\n- Monitor data freshness and pipeline performance\n\n### Development & Operations\n\n**10. Version Control & CI/CD**\n- Treat analytics code like application code\n- Use Git for version control of ETL scripts and configurations\n- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment\n- Enable safe experimentation and easy rollbacks\n\n**11. Metadata Management & Lineage Tracking**\n- Track end-to-end data lineage from source to final output\n- Use tools like DataHub, Amundsen, or dbt Catalog\n- Enable impact analysis to understand downstream effects\n- Support auditability and debugging\n\n**12. Automated Testing**\n- Build automated tests into transformation pipelines\n- Test data contracts, schema validation, and business rules\n- Catch issues before they reach production dashboards\n\n### Scalability & Performance\n\n**13. Parallel Processing**\n- Leverage distributed computing frameworks\n- Design jobs to run in parallel when possible\n- Optimize database configurations for parallel processing\n\n**14. Change Data Capture (CDC)**\n- Use log-based CDC for low-latency, low-overhead synchronization\n- Essential for real-time use cases: fraud detection, personalization\n- Design for exactly-once delivery\n\n**15.

search for the latest best practices for ETL data pipelines as of October 2025.\n\nLet me get more detailed information from the most relevant and recent sources.\n\nBased on the latest information from October 2025, here are the key best practices for ETL data pipelines:\n\n## Modern ETL Architecture Patterns\n\n**Hybrid Processing Models**\n- Support both batch and real-time streaming within the same framework\n- Implement exactly-once semantics for transactional pipelines using checkpointing and watermarking\n- Adopt event-driven architectures using brokers like Kafka or Redpanda for real-time processing\n\n**Microservices Design**\n- Build ETL components as independent, scalable microservices\n- Enable independent development, deployment, and scaling of each stage (extract, transform, load)\n- Support continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices\n\n## Data Quality & Governance\n\n**Comprehensive Data Quality**\n- Implement declarative constraints and validation rules early in the pipeline\n- Use anomaly detection with statistical thresholds or ML models\n- Establish automated handling for data quality issues (flagging, quarantining, fallback rules)\n- Integrate tools like Great Expectations for quality checks\n\n**Metadata Management**\n- Maintain end-to-end lineage tracking from raw source to final report\n- Implement impact analysis to understand downstream effects of changes\n- Use unified metadata repositories (DataHub, Amundsen)\n\n## Operational Excellence\n\n**Granular Data Control**\n- Extract only necessary data fields to reduce volumes and improve performance\n- Implement incremental loading for large datasets\n- Apply data filtering at the source level\n\n**Extensive Logging & Monitoring**\n- Maintain detailed structured logs for analysis and troubleshooting\n- Track metrics: latency, throughput, failure rates\n- Implement custom alerts and dead-letter queues\n- Provide pipeline-level cost insights\n\n**Fault Tolerance**\n- Design robust error handling with automatic retries for transient errors\n- Create fallback strategies for unrecoverable errors\n- Retain raw data for recovery purposes\n\n## Scalability & Performance\n\n**Plan for Scale**\n- Design pipelines with future data growth in mind\n- Implement parallel processing and auto-scaling capabilities\n- Leverage cloud data warehouse compute power for complex transformations\n- Use distributed computing frameworks\n\n**Optimization Techniques**\n- Minimize data movement through filtering and virtualization\n- Utilize parallel processing to improve throughput\n- Take advantage of cloud-native services for integration tasks\n\n## Development Practices\n\n**Version Control & CI/CD**\n- Version control all ETL logic using Git\n- Make pipelines testable and modular\n- Deploy using CI/CD pipelines across dev/stage/prod environments\n- Implement change management processes\n\n**Orchestration**\n- Use modern orchestration tools (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect)\n- Support dynamic DAGs, retries, and SLA enforcement\n- Enable event- and time-based triggers\n- Maintain workflow versioning and auditability\n\n## Security & Compliance\n\n- Implement encryption at rest and in transit\n- Establish field-level access control for sensitive data (PII)\n- Maintain immutable audit logs\n- Define clear data retention policies based on regulatory requirements\n\n## Cost Management\n\n- Monitor pipeline-level spend, especially for cloud services\n- Implement cost optimization strategies\n- Balance storage costs with data accessibility through archiving\n\n## Extensibility\n\n**Plugin Architecture**\n- Support connectors, functions, and destinations through plugins\n- Enable polyglot support (Python, Java, SQL)\n-

This is the most significant change affecting inset handling in 2026.\n\n### Key WindowInsets Types for Navigation & Gestures\n\n**Navigation Bar Insets:**\n- `WindowInsets.navigationBars` - Current navigation bar insets (bottom, left, or right)\n- `WindowInsets.navigationBarsIgnoringVisibility` - Navigation bar insets even when hidden (immersive mode)\n\n**Gesture-Related Insets:**\n- `WindowInsets.systemGestures` - Areas where system intercepts gestures for navigation\n- `WindowInsets.mandatorySystemGestures` - System gestures that always take priority (can't be overridden)\n- `WindowInsets.tappableElement` - Areas where taps are handled by the system (important for transparent navigation with gesture navigation)\n- `WindowInsets.tappableElementIgnoringVisibility` - Tappable element insets when visible\n\n### Recommended Safe Inset Types\n\nGoogle recommends using these high-level \"safe\" inset types:\n\n1. **`WindowInsets.safeDrawing`** - Prevents content from being obscured by system UI (most common use case)\n2. **`WindowInsets.safeGestures`** - Protects interactive content from gesture conflicts (bottom sheets, carousels, games)\n3. **`WindowInsets.safeContent`** - Combination of both safe drawing and safe gestures\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n**For Jetpack Compose:**\n- Use Material 3 `Scaffold` component - automatically handles insets for top/bottom app bars and navigation\n- Apply `Modifier.imePadding()` for keyboard (IME) insets\n- Use `WindowInsets.safeGestures` for gesture-sensitive UI elements\n- Handle display cutouts with `WindowInsets.displayCutout` or use safe inset types\n\n**For Views:**\n- Use `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` instead of deprecated `fitsSystemWindows`\n- Set `android:windowSoftInputMode=\"adjustResize\"` in AndroidManifest\n- Account for `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars()` and `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.displayCutout()`\n\n**Critical Guidelines:**\n1. **Draw backgrounds edge-to-edge** but **inset critical UI** (buttons, text, interactive elements)\n2. **Handle display cutouts** in landscape mode -

This is the most significant change affecting inset handling in 2026.\n\n### Key WindowInsets Types for Navigation & Gestures\n\n**Navigation Bar Insets:**\n- `WindowInsets.navigationBars` - Current navigation bar insets (bottom, left, or right)\n- `WindowInsets.navigationBarsIgnoringVisibility` - Navigation bar insets even when hidden (immersive mode)\n\n**Gesture-Related Insets:**\n- `WindowInsets.systemGestures` - Areas where system intercepts gestures for navigation\n- `WindowInsets.mandatorySystemGestures` - System gestures that always take priority (can't be overridden)\n- `WindowInsets.tappableElement` - Areas where taps are handled by the system (important for transparent navigation with gesture navigation)\n- `WindowInsets.tappableElementIgnoringVisibility` - Tappable element insets when visible\n\n### Recommended Safe Inset Types\n\nGoogle recommends using these high-level \"safe\" inset types:\n\n1. **`WindowInsets.safeDrawing`** - Prevents content from being obscured by system UI (most common use case)\n2. **`WindowInsets.safeGestures`** - Protects interactive content from gesture conflicts (bottom sheets, carousels, games)\n3. **`WindowInsets.safeContent`** - Combination of both safe drawing and safe gestures\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n**For Jetpack Compose:**\n- Use Material 3 `Scaffold` component - automatically handles insets for top/bottom app bars and navigation\n- Apply `Modifier.imePadding()` for keyboard (IME) insets\n- Use `WindowInsets.safeGestures` for gesture-sensitive UI elements\n- Handle display cutouts with `WindowInsets.displayCutout` or use safe inset types\n\n**For Views:**\n- Use `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` instead of deprecated `fitsSystemWindows`\n- Set `android:windowSoftInputMode=\"adjustResize\"` in AndroidManifest\n- Account for `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars()` and `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.displayCutout()`\n\n**Critical Guidelines:**\n1. **Draw backgrounds edge-to-edge** but **inset critical UI** (buttons, text, interactive elements)\n2. **Handle display cutouts** in landscape mode - they can obscure content on left/right edges\n3. **Account for caption bars** on desktop emulators and freeform windows\n4. **Don't forget the last list item** - use `clipToPadding=\"false\"` (Views) or `contentPadding` (Compose)\n5. **Handle IME insets** separately - keyboard requires special attention\n6. **Use `enableEdgeToEdge()`** for backward compatibility instead of deprecated `setDecorFitsSystemWindows`\n\n### Gesture Navigation Specifics\n\n- **Transparent navigation bars** with gesture navigation allow some app elements to be tappable through the navigation UI\n- Use `WindowInsets.tappableElement` to understand where system intercepts taps vs. app taps\n- Use `Modifier.systemGestureExclusion()` (Compose) to request handling of limited system gestures, but note that `mandatorySystemGestures` always take priority\n\n### Temporary Opt-Out (Not Recommended)\n\nIf you need more time to implement proper inset handling, you can temporarily opt-out using `R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement`, but this flag **will be non-functional in the near future** and should not be used as a long-term solution.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Insets handling tips for Android 15's edge-to-edge enforcement | Android Developers](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/insets-handling-tips-for-android-15s-edge-to-edge-enforcement-872774e8839b)\n- [About window insets | Jetpack Compose | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/system/insets)","timestamp":50114}],"duration":50114,"pass":true,"score":0.89,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Applications must handle insets properly using WindowInsets APIs (for Views) or `systemBarsPadding()` modifiers (for Jetpack Compose).\n\n### Understanding System Bars and Safe Areas\n\n**System Bars:**\n- **Status Bar** (top): Shows battery, time, Wi-Fi, notifications\n- **Navigation Bar** (bottom): Back, home, and recent apps (buttons or gesture handle)\n\n**Safe Area:** The area where content can be displayed without being obscured by system UI elements.\n\n### WindowInsets API - Core Inset Types\n\nAndroid provides several inset types through `WindowInsetsCompat`:\n\n1. **System Bars Insets** - Covers both status and navigation bars\n2. **Navigation Bar Gesture Insets** - Specifically for the gesture navigation area\n3. **System Gesture Insets** - Areas reserved for system gestures\n\n### Implementing Edge-to-Edge\n\n#### For Jetpack Compose:\n\n```kotlin\n// Using Scaffold's innerPadding (recommended)\nScaffold(\n    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()\n) { innerPadding ->\n    Box(\n        modifier = Modifier\n            .fillMaxSize()\n            .padding(innerPadding)\n    ) {\n        // Your content\n    }\n}\n\n// Without Scaffold - manual padding\nColumn(\n    modifier = Modifier\n        .fillMaxSize()\n        .statusBarsPadding()      // Top padding\n        .navigationBarsPadding()  // Bottom padding\n) {\n    // Content\n}\n```\n\n#### For XML Views:\n\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(findViewById(R.id.rootView)) { view, insets ->\n    val systemBars = insets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n    view.setPadding(systemBars.left, systemBars.top, systemBars.right, systemBars.bottom)\n    insets\n}\n```\n\n### Handling Navigation Bar Gesture Insets\n\nFor content that needs to avoid the gesture navigation area:\n\n```kotlin\n// Get gesture insets specifically\nval gestureInsets = insets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures())\nval navigationBarInsets = insets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.navigationBars())\n```\n\n### Safe Area Insets (CSS/Web)\n\nFor web content in Chrome on Android, use CSS environment variables:\n\n```css\n.bottom-element {\n  position: fixed;\n  bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px);\n  \n  /* For optimal performance, use max insets too */\n  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-max-inset-bottom, 36px);\n  bottom: calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px) - env(safe-area-max-inset-bottom, 36px));\n}\n```\n\n**Enable edge-to-edge in web:**\n```html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover\" />\n```\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Avoid Double Insets**: Don't apply insets twice. Use `consumeWindowInsets()` in Compose or `WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED` in Views to prevent propagation.\n\n2. **IME (Keyboard) Padding**: For elements that should stay visible when keyboard appears:\n   ```kotlin\n   Button(\n       modifier = Modifier.imePadding()  // Keeps button above keyboard\n   ) { Text(\"Submit\") }\n   ```\n\n3. **Don't Modify TopAppBar/BottomAppBar**: These components already handle insets internally. Adding extra padding will cause layout issues.\n\n4. **Use Specific Inset Types**: Choose the appropriate inset type:\n   - `systemBars()` - For general UI\n   - `navigationBars()` - Bottom navigation area\n   - `statusBars()` - Top status bar area\n   - `systemGestures()` - System gesture areas\n   - `ime()` - Keyboard area\n\n5. **Test with Gesture Navigation**: Always test with gesture navigation enabled (not just 3-button navigation), as this is the default on modern devices.\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n**Problem**: Content hidden behind navigation bar\n**Solution**: Apply `navigationBarsPadding()` or use `safe-area-inset-bottom`\n\n**Problem**: Layout shifting/thrashing\n**Solution**: Use `safe-area-max-inset-bottom` with calculated offsets instead of dynamic padding\n\n**Problem**: Elements stretched awkwardly\n**Solution**: Check for double inset application and consume insets after first use\n\nSources:\n- [Mastering Edge-to-Edge in Android with WindowInsets | Medium](https://medium.com/@farimarwat/mastering-edge-to-edge-in-android-with-windowinsets-cc469168ba34)\n- [Chrome on Android edge-to-edge migration guide | Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/edge-to-edge)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the 2026 Android guidelines on handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets.","timestamp":55095},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":55095},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01B4iU8B18SiU2JL1vuour9R","status":"completed","timestamp":55095},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch more specific content from the official Android documentation and relevant technical resources:","timestamp":55095},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":55095},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":55095},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01A2jVfJo8D38Mxnhc5aM1VB","status":"completed","timestamp":55095},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015dtbx7iV432g8uEjdE5xhf","status":"completed","timestamp":55095},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific Android documentation on gesture insets:","timestamp":55095},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":55095},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012i5iJttRVpxS4ShGY7HLsB","status":"completed","timestamp":55095},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the comprehensive content I've gathered, here are the **2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets**:\n\n## Key 2026 Android Edge-to-Edge Guidelines\n\n### Mandatory Edge-to-Edge Support\nStarting with **Android 15 (API 35)**, edge-to-edge is **mandatory** for all apps.
