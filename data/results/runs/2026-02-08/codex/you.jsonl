Azure AI Foundry is the UI/branding layer; the actual model deployment is an Azure OpenAI deployment behind a Cognitive Services account.

([postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Differentiate “not provided” vs “provided but empty.”** In PostgreSQL, `NULL` and `{}` are distinct; treat them differently in your logic if they carry different business meaning (e.g., “no overrides” vs “override list intentionally empty”). Array functions return `NULL` when the array is `NULL`, and an empty array when there are no matches. ([postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-array.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Handle `NULL` explicitly in the function body.** By default, functions are called even when arguments are null, so add explicit checks (`IF overrides IS NULL THEN ...`). Don’t mark the function `STRICT` unless you want the whole function to return `NULL` when the array is `NULL`. ([postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Prefer POST with JSON body and a typed array parameter.** PostgREST supports array parameters in JSON; it maps JSON keys to function parameter names. Use this for clean client calls. ([postgrest.org](https://postgrest.org/en/v10/api.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **If overrides are complex objects, accept `jsonb` instead of a typed array.** PostgREST recommends a single `jsonb` parameter when passing arrays of objects, which you can iterate server‑side.

Use an `image` part alongside `text`. The image can be a URL, base64 string/data URL, or binary buffer; you can also provide `mediaType`. ([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview'),\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: 'user',\n      content: [\n        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the photo and count the birds.' },\n        {\n          type: 'image',\n          image: 'https://example.com/birds.jpg', // or base64/data URL/Buffer\n          mediaType: 'image/jpeg',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n});\n\n// Stream text tokens as they arrive\nfor await (const part of result.fullStream) {\n  if (part.type === 'text-delta') process.stdout.write(part.text);\n}\n```\n\n**Image output from multimodal LLMs (text + images in the response)**  \nSome LLMs return images directly in `result.files`. With `streamText`, you typically stream the text first, then `await result` to access the generated images. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: 'google/gemini-3-pro-image',\n  prompt: 'Generate a watercolor scene of a misty harbor at sunrise.',\n});\n\n// Stream text\nfor await (const part of result.fullStream) {\n  if (part.type === 'text-delta') process.stdout.write(part.text);\n}\n\n// Then access images\nconst finalResult = await result;\nfor (const file of finalResult.files) {\n  if (file.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')) {\n    // file.base64 (data URL), file.uint8Array, file.mediaType\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat `files` array includes image data in convenient formats (base64/data URL or `Uint8Array`). ([v5.ai-sdk.dev](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/image-generation))\n\n**Image output via OpenAI tool results (streamed tool events)**  \nSome OpenAI models generate images through a provider-defined tool, and with `streamText` those images appear as `tool-result` events in the stream (not in `files`). ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: 'openai/gpt-5.1-instant',\n  prompt: 'Generate an image of a corgi playing with balloons.',\n  tools: {\n    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({\n      outputFormat: 'webp',\n      quality: 'high',\n    }),\n  },\n});\n\nfor await (const part of result.fullStream) {\n  if (part.type === 'tool-result' && part.toolName === 'image_generation') {\n    const base64Image = part.output.result;\n    // save base64Image...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**What “image support” means in practice (2026)**  \n- Input: `streamText` supports image parts inside user messages (URLs, base64, or binary). ([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text))  \n- Output: If the model is multimodal and returns images, they come via `result.files` after the stream completes. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk))  \n- Some providers (notably OpenAI image-generation tool flows) stream images as tool results instead of `files`.

([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: google('gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview'),\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: 'user',\n      content: [\n        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the photo and count the birds.' },\n        {\n          type: 'image',\n          image: 'https://example.com/birds.jpg', // or base64/data URL/Buffer\n          mediaType: 'image/jpeg',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n});\n\n// Stream text tokens as they arrive\nfor await (const part of result.fullStream) {\n  if (part.type === 'text-delta') process.stdout.write(part.text);\n}\n```\n\n**Image output from multimodal LLMs (text + images in the response)**  \nSome LLMs return images directly in `result.files`. With `streamText`, you typically stream the text first, then `await result` to access the generated images. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: 'google/gemini-3-pro-image',\n  prompt: 'Generate a watercolor scene of a misty harbor at sunrise.',\n});\n\n// Stream text\nfor await (const part of result.fullStream) {\n  if (part.type === 'text-delta') process.stdout.write(part.text);\n}\n\n// Then access images\nconst finalResult = await result;\nfor (const file of finalResult.files) {\n  if (file.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')) {\n    // file.base64 (data URL), file.uint8Array, file.mediaType\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat `files` array includes image data in convenient formats (base64/data URL or `Uint8Array`). ([v5.ai-sdk.dev](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/image-generation))\n\n**Image output via OpenAI tool results (streamed tool events)**  \nSome OpenAI models generate images through a provider-defined tool, and with `streamText` those images appear as `tool-result` events in the stream (not in `files`). ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: 'openai/gpt-5.1-instant',\n  prompt: 'Generate an image of a corgi playing with balloons.',\n  tools: {\n    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({\n      outputFormat: 'webp',\n      quality: 'high',\n    }),\n  },\n});\n\nfor await (const part of result.fullStream) {\n  if (part.type === 'tool-result' && part.toolName === 'image_generation') {\n    const base64Image = part.output.result;\n    // save base64Image...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**What “image support” means in practice (2026)**  \n- Input: `streamText` supports image parts inside user messages (URLs, base64, or binary). ([v6.ai-sdk.dev](https://v6.ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text))  \n- Output: If the model is multimodal and returns images, they come via `result.files` after the stream completes. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk))  \n- Some providers (notably OpenAI image-generation tool flows) stream images as tool results instead of `files`. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk))\n\nIf you want, tell me which provider/model you’re targeting (Gemini, OpenAI, Vercel v0, etc.), and I’ll tailor a complete `streamText` snippet (server route + client) for that stack.","timestamp":66519}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Vercel AI SDK multimodal","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770546305956,"end":1770546372475,"firstResponse":66519,"sessionCreation":0,"total":66519},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/12/video-is-the-main-content?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Why it happens**\n- Google now only shows video results (including Video mode) when the video is the *main content* of the page; blog posts where video is secondary are explicitly called out as examples that won’t qualify. ([developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/12/video-is-the-main-content?utm_source=openai))\n- The Video Indexing report will show “No video indexed” / “Video is not the main content of the page” in those cases.

It uses only HTTPX/HTTPCore primary sources.\n\nKey facts from the docs/source\n- HTTPX exposes a `trace` request extension; the callback receives an `event_name` and `info` for HTTPCore transport events. citeturn3contents0\n- Event hooks include `request` (before send) and `response` (after response fetched, before body read), which are useful for timing. citeturn2contents0\n- HTTPCore emits `http11.receive_response_headers` around response header receipt, and similarly for HTTP/2 (`http2.receive_response_headers`). citeturn1contents0turn4contents0\n- The trace callback receives a `.started` and `.complete` pair around the underlying operation. citeturn3contents0\n\n**Sync example: TTFB via trace (headers timing)**\n\n```python\nimport contextvars\nimport time\nimport httpx\n\n# Per-task/current-request tracking for async-safety.\n_current_req_id = contextvars.ContextVar(\"current_req_id\", default=None)\n_t0_by_req_id = {}\n\ndef trace(event_name, info):\n    now = time.perf_counter()\n\n    if event_name.endswith(\"send_request_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _t0_by_req_id[id(req)] = now\n\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _current_req_id.set(id(req))\n\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.complete\"):\n        req_id = _current_req_id.get()\n        if req_id is not None:\n            t0 = _t0_by_req_id.pop(req_id, None)\n            if t0 is not None:\n                ttfb_ms = (now - t0) * 1000\n                print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb_ms:.2f} ms\")\n\nwith httpx.Client() as client:\n    client.get(\"https://www.example.com\", extensions={\"trace\": trace})\n```\n\nWhy this works\n- `send_request_headers.started` marks the moment the request is about to hit the wire. citeturn1contents0\n- `receive_response_headers.*` wraps the point where headers are obtained. citeturn1contents0turn4contents0\n- The trace extension is the official way to observe these transport events. citeturn3contents0\n\n**Async variant (same trace callback works)**\n\n```python\nimport contextvars\nimport time\nimport httpx\n\n_current_req_id = contextvars.ContextVar(\"current_req_id\", default=None)\n_t0_by_req_id = {}\n\nasync def trace(event_name, info):\n    now = time.perf_counter()\n    if event_name.endswith(\"send_request_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _t0_by_req_id[id(req)] = now\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _current_req_id.set(id(req))\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.complete\"):\n        req_id = _current_req_id.get()\n        if req_id is not None:\n            t0 = _t0_by_req_id.pop(req_id, None)\n            if t0 is not None:\n                print(f\"TTFB: {(now - t0) * 1000:.2f} ms\")\n\nasync with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n    await client.get(\"https://www.example.com\", extensions={\"trace\": trace})\n```\n\nNotes and gotchas\n- HTTP/2 can multiplex multiple responses; pairing `.started`/`.complete` safely requires task-local state (hence `contextvars`).

It uses only HTTPX/HTTPCore primary sources.\n\nKey facts from the docs/source\n- HTTPX exposes a `trace` request extension; the callback receives an `event_name` and `info` for HTTPCore transport events. citeturn3contents0\n- Event hooks include `request` (before send) and `response` (after response fetched, before body read), which are useful for timing. citeturn2contents0\n- HTTPCore emits `http11.receive_response_headers` around response header receipt, and similarly for HTTP/2 (`http2.receive_response_headers`). citeturn1contents0turn4contents0\n- The trace callback receives a `.started` and `.complete` pair around the underlying operation. citeturn3contents0\n\n**Sync example: TTFB via trace (headers timing)**\n\n```python\nimport contextvars\nimport time\nimport httpx\n\n# Per-task/current-request tracking for async-safety.\n_current_req_id = contextvars.ContextVar(\"current_req_id\", default=None)\n_t0_by_req_id = {}\n\ndef trace(event_name, info):\n    now = time.perf_counter()\n\n    if event_name.endswith(\"send_request_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _t0_by_req_id[id(req)] = now\n\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _current_req_id.set(id(req))\n\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.complete\"):\n        req_id = _current_req_id.get()\n        if req_id is not None:\n            t0 = _t0_by_req_id.pop(req_id, None)\n            if t0 is not None:\n                ttfb_ms = (now - t0) * 1000\n                print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb_ms:.2f} ms\")\n\nwith httpx.Client() as client:\n    client.get(\"https://www.example.com\", extensions={\"trace\": trace})\n```\n\nWhy this works\n- `send_request_headers.started` marks the moment the request is about to hit the wire. citeturn1contents0\n- `receive_response_headers.*` wraps the point where headers are obtained. citeturn1contents0turn4contents0\n- The trace extension is the official way to observe these transport events. citeturn3contents0\n\n**Async variant (same trace callback works)**\n\n```python\nimport contextvars\nimport time\nimport httpx\n\n_current_req_id = contextvars.ContextVar(\"current_req_id\", default=None)\n_t0_by_req_id = {}\n\nasync def trace(event_name, info):\n    now = time.perf_counter()\n    if event_name.endswith(\"send_request_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _t0_by_req_id[id(req)] = now\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.started\"):\n        req = info[\"request\"]\n        _current_req_id.set(id(req))\n    elif event_name.endswith(\"receive_response_headers.complete\"):\n        req_id = _current_req_id.get()\n        if req_id is not None:\n            t0 = _t0_by_req_id.pop(req_id, None)\n            if t0 is not None:\n                print(f\"TTFB: {(now - t0) * 1000:.2f} ms\")\n\nasync with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n    await client.get(\"https://www.example.com\", extensions={\"trace\": trace})\n```\n\nNotes and gotchas\n- HTTP/2 can multiplex multiple responses; pairing `.started`/`.complete` safely requires task-local state (hence `contextvars`).

([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/design-multimodal-prompts?utm_source=openai))\n(These are inferences applied to medical imaging, based on Vertex AI’s multimodal and prompt‑design guidance.)\n\n**Few‑shot and iterative optimization**\n- **Add a few labeled examples** (small set of images with correct box outputs) to anchor the model’s interpretation and formatting. Few‑shot examples are a recommended strategy for prompt design. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies?utm_source=openai))\n- **Use Vertex AI Prompt Optimizer** to iterate on instructions + demonstrations if you have evaluation metrics (IoU, precision/recall). This is explicitly supported for prompt optimization and is designed to improve prompt quality. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-vertex-ai-prompt-optimizer?utm_source=openai))\n- **Version and manage prompts** via the Vertex AI SDK prompt management module to track improvements and prevent regressions. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/prompt-classes?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Structure and safety**\n- **Use system instructions** for format rigidity and compliance (“Return JSON only; no prose”). System instructions and structured prompts are recommended best practices. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies?utm_source=openai))\n- **Keep prompts concise** for latency and reliability; Vertex AI guidance highlights prompt length as a latency and quality lever. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompt-best-practices?utm_source=openai))\n- **Leverage Vertex AI Studio tools** (prompt refinement / “Help me write”) to speed iteration when prototyping. ([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Example prompt template (text‑only; use with image input)**\n```text\nSYSTEM: You are a medical‑imaging detection assistant.

The Python docs describe `interrupt()` plus the `Interrupt` type and `Command` object, but I did not find a `HumanInterrupt` type in the official Python reference. In practice, the interrupt objects you receive are `langgraph.types.Interrupt` with `id` and `value`. If you meant “human interrupt” as a concept, it maps to these `Interrupt` objects and the `interrupt()` function.\n\n**How interrupts + resume work (Python, 2026)**\n- Call `interrupt(value)` inside a node to pause execution and surface `value` to the caller.\n- You must enable a checkpointer.\n- You must supply a stable `thread_id` in `config` to resume the same checkpoint.\n- The paused run returns an `__interrupt__` field containing `Interrupt` objects (`id`, `value`).\n- Resume by invoking the graph again with `Command(resume=...)`.\n- The node re-executes from the beginning when resumed.\n\n**Minimal example (interrupt + resume):**\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Optional\n\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    task: str\n    approved: Optional[bool]\n\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and request human input\n    approved = interrupt({\"question\": \"Approve this task?\", \"task\": state[\"task\"]})\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"approval\", approval_node)\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"approval\")\nbuilder.add_edge(\"approval\", END)\n\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"task-123\"}}\n\n# 1) Initial run (interrupts)\nresult = graph.invoke({\"task\": \"Deploy to prod\", \"approved\": None}, config=config)\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])  # -> [Interrupt(value=..., id=...)]\n\n# 2) Resume with human input\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\n```\n\n**Resuming specific interrupts**\nIf multiple interrupts are pending, `Command.resume` can be a mapping from interrupt IDs to values:\n```python\n# Example: resume by interrupt id\nresume_payload = {\n    \"f1c2...\": True,\n    \"a9b8...\": {\"edit\": \"Change wording\"}\n}\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=resume_payload), config=config)\n```\nThis is supported because `Command.resume` accepts either a single value or a dict of `interrupt_id -> value`.\n\n**Streaming (human-in-the-loop)**\nWhen streaming, you can watch for `__interrupt__` in updates, collect human input, then resume using `Command(resume=...)`.

PyTorch docs call out “poison fork” and require `spawn`/`forkserver` for CUDA in subprocesses. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Make sure **no CUDA initialization happens before processes start**. Any `torch.cuda.*`, model `.cuda()`, or even implicit CUDA context creation in the parent can deadlock children. ([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n- Guard multiprocessing entry with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` and set the start method only once. This is required for correct `spawn` behavior. ([docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nSafe patterns that avoid deadlock\n- Prefer `torch.multiprocessing.spawn(...)` (or `multiprocessing.get_context(\"spawn\")`) and build/load the model **inside** each worker process.\n- Load weights on CPU first, then move to GPU after process start:\n  - `state = torch.load(path, map_location=\"cpu\")`\n  - `model.load_state_dict(state)`\n  - `model.to(device)` and then wrap in `DDP`\n- If you must share objects between processes, avoid `multiprocessing.Queue` when deadlocks appear; it can involve threads that are unsafe with `fork` (a known PyTorch warning). A `SimpleQueue` is safer in these cases. ([docs.pytorch.wiki](https://docs.pytorch.wiki/en/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nMinimal example (safe)\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\ndef worker(rank, path):\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    model = Model()\n    state = torch.load(path, map_location=\"cpu\")\n    model.load_state_dict(state)\n    model.to(rank)\n    model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[rank])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    mp.spawn(worker, args=(ckpt_path,), nprocs=ngpus, join=True)\n```\nWhy this works: `spawn` gives each process a clean interpreter and CUDA init happens only inside the worker. ([docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nOther gotchas to check\n- Don’t mix objects created under one multiprocessing context with another (e.g., locks/queues). ([docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n- If you’re using Python 3.14+ on Linux, note the default start method changed to `forkserver`, which is safer than `fork` but still requires clean CUDA init ordering.

The core change in 2025 is that MCP replaced the old HTTP+SSE transport with the new Streamable HTTP transport, and the new transport expects a single “MCP endpoint” (commonly `/mcp`) rather than the legacy `/sse` endpoint. ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports?utm_source=openai))\n\nWhat to change in LiveKit Agents v1.2 (client side)\n\n- If your MCP server upgraded to the 2025 spec (Streamable HTTP), update the URL to the MCP endpoint (usually `/mcp`) and/or explicitly set `transport_type=\"streamable_http\"`. LiveKit’s MCP client auto-detects transport based on the URL ending (`/mcp` → streamable HTTP, `/sse` → SSE), and SSE is explicitly noted as deprecated. ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports?utm_source=openai))  \n- If your MCP server is still on the older HTTP+SSE transport, keep using `/sse` (or set `transport_type=\"sse\"`). The LiveKit example still shows `/sse`, which will break once the server removes that endpoint. \n\nExample update (client)\n\n```python\nfrom livekit.agents import mcp\n\n# New 2025 transport (Streamable HTTP)\nmcp_server = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"http://localhost:8000/mcp\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\",\n)\n\n# Legacy transport (HTTP+SSE)\nmcp_server_legacy = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"http://localhost:8000/sse\",\n    transport_type=\"sse\",\n)\n```\n\n\nServer-side checklist (if you control the MCP server)\n\n- Confirm the server supports Streamable HTTP (single endpoint that accepts POST + GET on the same path, often `/mcp`).

This file can set minimum severity and **exclude checks** to form your baseline policy. ([aquasecurity.github.io](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/v1.28.7/guides/configuration/config/?utm_source=openai))\n- **checkov**: use a `.checkov.yaml`/`.checkov.yml` in the repo or pass a config file explicitly. The config file is looked up in well‑defined locations, so you can standardize on a single repo‑root config as your baseline. ([github.com](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2) Prefer scoped, inline exceptions over global skips**\n- **tfsec inline ignore** (resource‑level exception): add `#tfsec:ignore:<rule>` on the offending line or above the block; you can list multiple ignores on one line. ([aquasecurity.github.io](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/v1.6.2/getting-started/configuration/ignores/?utm_source=openai))\n- **checkov inline skip** (resource‑level exception): add `checkov:skip=<check_id>:<reason>` inside the resource scope so the skip is tied to a single resource with a justification string. ([checkov.io](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3) Use run‑level skips only for true baseline exclusions**\n- **checkov**: global allow/deny lists via `--check` and `--skip-check` (or via config) are meant for shaping the overall policy set, not for one‑off exceptions. ([checkov.io](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n- **tfsec**: use config‑file **exclude checks** only when the check is out‑of‑scope for your entire estate (e.g., a policy you’ve formally replaced with another control).

This file can set minimum severity and **exclude checks** to form your baseline policy. ([aquasecurity.github.io](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/v1.28.7/guides/configuration/config/?utm_source=openai))\n- **checkov**: use a `.checkov.yaml`/`.checkov.yml` in the repo or pass a config file explicitly. The config file is looked up in well‑defined locations, so you can standardize on a single repo‑root config as your baseline. ([github.com](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2) Prefer scoped, inline exceptions over global skips**\n- **tfsec inline ignore** (resource‑level exception): add `#tfsec:ignore:<rule>` on the offending line or above the block; you can list multiple ignores on one line. ([aquasecurity.github.io](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/v1.6.2/getting-started/configuration/ignores/?utm_source=openai))\n- **checkov inline skip** (resource‑level exception): add `checkov:skip=<check_id>:<reason>` inside the resource scope so the skip is tied to a single resource with a justification string. ([checkov.io](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3) Use run‑level skips only for true baseline exclusions**\n- **checkov**: global allow/deny lists via `--check` and `--skip-check` (or via config) are meant for shaping the overall policy set, not for one‑off exceptions.
