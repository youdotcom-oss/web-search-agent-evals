Use `ufw-\ndocker` Script (Recommended)\nThis script integrates Docker's firewall rules with UFW, allowing you to manage container port access using `ufw` commands.\n\n*   **Installation:**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo wget -O /\nusr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\n    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-\ndocker\n    \n```\n\n*   **Usage Examples:**\n    *   Allow HTTP traffic to container IP `172.17.0.2`:\n        `sudo ufw route allow proto tcp from any to 172\n.17.0.2 port 80`\n    *   Or use the script directly: `ufw-docker allow <port>`\n\n### 2. Manually Modify `/etc/ufw/after.rules\n`\nThis method involves adding specific `iptables` rules to UFW's `after.rules` file to allow UFW to manage public network access to Docker services while maintaining internal container communication.\n\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.\n  Ensure Docker's `iptables` feature is enabled (default).\n    2.  Add the following rules to the end of `/etc/ufw/after.rules`:\n        \n```\n        # BEGIN UFW AND DOCK\nER\n        *filter\n        :ufw-user-forward - [0:0]\n        :DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s\n 10.0.0.0/8\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n        -A DOCKER-USER\n -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j\n DROP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j\n DROP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p tcp\n -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p udp -\nm udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p udp -m udp --\ndport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8\n        -A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p udp -m udp --dport 0:327\n67 -d 172.16.0.0/12\n        # END UFW AND DOCKER\n        \n```\n\n    3.  Restart UFW: `sudo systemctl restart ufw\n`\n\n### 3. Restrict Port Publishing\n*   **Avoid publishing unnecessary ports:** Only publish ports that need external access.\n*   **Bind to local interface:** If access is only needed from the Docker host, bind the published port\n to `127.0.0.1` (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8080:80`).","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Docker bypass UFW firewall solution 2024 container internal network external traffic</web-search>","timestamp":26014},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":26014},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769457298992-4e7ab9ce90d6f","status":"completed","timestamp":26014},{"type":"message","content":"Docker's default networking behavior can bypass UFW rules because Docker directly manip","timestamp":26014},{"type":"message","content":"ulates `iptables` before UFW's rules are applied, potentially exposing container ports.\n\nHere are the recommended solutions for managing Docker container traffic with UFW in 2024:\n\n### 1.

I see you're having trouble with indexing YouTube videos embedded in your blog posts.\n Based on the search results, here's a plan to address this:\n\nFirst, I'll check for a\n `robots.txt` file to ensure no indexing blocks are present.\nSecond, I'll search for video-\nrelated schema markup (`VideoObject`) in your project to see if it's being used correctly.\nThird, I'll look\n for video sitemaps, which are crucial for helping Google discover your video content.\nFinally, I'll check for common\n HTML video embedding practices, like the use of `<iframe>` tags.\n\nI will start by checking for a `robots.txt\n` file.\nThere\n is no `robots.txt` file in the current directory. This is good, as it\n means there are no rules explicitly blocking search engines.\n\nNow, I'll proceed with the next step in my plan\n and search for `VideoObject` schema markup in your project to ensure your embedded videos are correctly structured for Google's craw\nlers. This will help me determine if your project is already using this best practice for video SEO.\nI\n couldn't find any instances of \"VideoObject\" schema markup in your project. This is\n a missed opportunity for SEO, as this markup helps Google understand and index your video content. I highly recommend adding it.\n\nNext,\n I'll search for a video sitemap. A video sitemap is a file that provides Google with information about the\n videos on your site, which can improve their visibility in search results. I will now search for any XML files that might\n be a video sitemap. I'll focus on files with \"sitemap\" in the name, as this is a common convention\n.\nI\n couldn't find a video sitemap. This, combined with the missing \n`VideoObject` schema, is likely the primary reason your embedded videos aren't being indexed.\n\nTo help you resolve\n this, I will create a basic `sitemap.xml` file for you with a placeholder for a video. You\n'll need to replace the placeholder information with the actual details of your video and blog post.\n\nI will now create the \n`sitemap.xml` file. This file will contain a sample video entry that you can adapt for your own use. I\n will include comments in the file to guide you on how to fill in the necessary information.\nI apologize for the error. It seems I misjudged my capabilities. I will\n now create the `sitemap.xml` file using a different method.\n\nI will use the `echo` command\n to create the `sitemap.xml` file. This command will write the provided text into the file.\nI am unable to create files\n directly. However, I can provide you with the necessary content and instructions to solve the video indexing issue.\n\nHere is\n the content for your `sitemap.xml` file. Please create a file named `sitemap.xml` in the\n root directory of your project and paste the following content into it:\n\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding\n=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/s\nitemap/0.9\"\n        xmlns:video=\"http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap\n-video/1.1\">\n  <url>\n    <!-- Replace this with the URL of the blog post containing the\n video -->\n    <loc>http://www.example.com/blog/post-with-video</loc>\n    \n<video:video>\n      <!-- This should be the URL of your YouTube video -->\n      <video:player_\nloc allow_embed=\"yes\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID</video\n:player_loc>\n      <!-- Replace this with the URL of a high-quality thumbnail image for the video -->\n\n      <video:thumbnail_loc>http://www.example.com/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg</video:thumbnail_\nloc>\n      <!-- Replace these with the actual title and description of your video -->\n      <video:title>My\n Awesome Video</video:title>\n      <video:description>A great description of my awesome video.</video:description>\n\n      <!-- The duration of the video in seconds -->\n      <video:duration>600</video:duration>\n\n      <!-- The date the video was uploaded, in W3C format -->\n      <video:publication_date>2\n024-01-26T14:30:00+00:00</video:\npublication_date>\n    </video:video>\n  </url>\n</urlset>\n\n```\n\n\n\n**Next, you need to add `VideoObject` schema markup to the HTML of your blog post.** This will help Google\n understand the video's content. Here is an example of what to add within the `<head>` or `<body>` of your\n HTML file.\n\n\n```html\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https\n://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"My Awesome Video\",\n\n  \"description\": \"A great description of my awesome video.\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"http://www.example.\ncom/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-2\n6T14:30:00+00:00\",\n  \"duration\": \"PT\n10M0S\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\n\",\n  \"interactionStatistic\": {\n    \"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\",\n    \"interactionType\": {\n \"@type\": \"http://schema.org/WatchAction\" },\n    \"userInteractionCount\": 12\n345\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n```\n\n\n**Finally, after creating the `sitemap\n.xml` file and adding the `VideoObject` schema, you need to submit the sitemap to Google Search Console.** This\n will notify Google of the new sitemap and encourage it to crawl and index your video content.\n\nTo summarize, here\n are the steps you need to take:\n\n1.  Create a `sitemap.xml` file in your project'\ns root directory with the content I provided.\n2.  Add the `VideoObject` schema markup to the HTML of your blog\n posts that contain videos.\n3.  Submit your `sitemap.xml` file to Google Search Console.\n\n4.  Use the URL Inspection tool in Google Search Console to check the indexing status of your blog post pages.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: YouTube embed video not indexing blog posts Google Search Console solutions 2024</web-search>","timestamp":55913},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":55913},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769457845189-658241cedb96b8","status":"completed","timestamp":55913},{"type":"message","content":"OK","timestamp":55913},{"type":"message","content":".

KSP acts as a powerful compiler plugin that automates boilerplate code generation, making i18n implementation more robust and\n less error-prone.\n\nKey aspects of KMP i18n with KSP in the current landscape include:\n\n*   **Moko Resources:** A prominent open-source library for KMP i18n. It enables\n developers to maintain a single source of truth for string resources and provides access to these resources on both Android and iOS, supporting default system localization. Moko Resources utilizes code generation to create a class (e.g., `MR`) that contains\n all the defined strings, making them accessible in the `commonMain` shared module.\n*   **KSP for Enhanced Type Safety:** While Moko Resources handles much of the generation, KSP can be used to further enhance the i\n18n solution. For instance, a custom Gradle task can employ KSP to read the `MR.kt` file generated by Moko Resources, extract string and plural resource keys, and then generate additional type-safe sealed classes for\n resource access. This approach improves compile-time safety and developer experience.\n*   **Compose Multiplatform Resources:** For projects utilizing Compose Multiplatform, JetBrains introduced a built-in API with Compose Multiplatform 1.6.0\n for resource sharing.

It offers `Locale` and `LocalizedString` classes to manage translatable messages.\n*   **KSP Integration in KMP Projects:**\n Integrating KSP into a multiplatform project involves configuring `ksp` dependencies for specific compilation targets or source sets (e.g., `kspCommonMainMetadata`).

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">How do I find information about: LangGraph human interrupt resume how to use Python HumanInterrupt interrupt types Command resume 2026?</web-search>","output":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">How do I find information about: LangGraph human interrupt resume how to use Python HumanInterrupt interrupt types Command resume 2026?</web-search>\nTo implement a human-in-the-loop pattern in a LangGraph application, you can use the\n `interrupt()` function to pause the graph's execution and wait for external input before proceeding. To resume the graph,\n you'll need to use a checkpointer and reinvoke the graph with a `Command(resume=...)` object\n.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this, with a code example:\n\n### \n1. Key Concepts\n\n*   **`interrupt()`**: This function, when called within a node, pauses the graph\n's execution. It can be used to wait for human input or any other external action.\n*   **Check\npointer**: To resume a graph, its state must be saved. LangGraph uses checkpointers for this purpose. For this example, we\n'll use `InMemorySaver`, which is suitable for development.\n*   **`thread_id`**: This\n identifier is used to track the state of a specific graph execution. When you resume a graph, you must use the same \n`thread_id` to load the correct state.\n*   **`Command(resume=...)`**: This is\n a special object that you pass to the graph to resume its execution. The value passed to `resume` will be returned\n by the `interrupt()` call in the paused node.\n\n### 2. Example Implementation\n\nHere is a Python example\n that demonstrates how to interrupt a graph for human approval and then resume it:\n\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n, Annotated, List\nimport operator\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph\n.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n\n# 1. Define the\n state of the graph\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\n    task: str\n    approval: str\n    messages\n: Annotated[List[str], operator.add]\n\n# 2. Create a node that will interrupt the graph for\n human input\ndef get_approval(state: AgentState):\n    print(f\"Task requires approval: {state['\ntask']}\")\n    # The interrupt() function pauses the graph and waits for external input.\n    # The value passed\n to Command(resume=...) will be returned here.\n    human_input = interrupt(\"Waiting for human approval (\napprove/reject)...\")\n    return {\"approval\": human_input}\n\n# 3. Create a node to\n process the human's decision\ndef process_decision(state: AgentState):\n    if state['approval'].lower\n() == 'approve':\n        print(\"Task approved. Proceeding...\")\n        return {\"messages\": [\"Task approved.\"\n]}\n    else:\n        print(\"Task rejected. Cancelling...\")\n        return {\"messages\": [\"Task rejected.\"\n]}\n\n# 4. Build the graph\nworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)\n\nworkflow.add_node(\"\nget_approval\", get_approval)\nworkflow.add_node(\"process_decision\", process_decision)\n\n\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"get_approval\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"get_approval\",\n \"process_decision\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"process_decision\", END)\n\n# 5. Compile\n the graph with a checkpointer\napp = workflow.compile(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\n\n# 6. Define a unique\n thread ID for this execution\nthread_id = \"my_thread_123\"\nconfig = {\"configurable\n\": {\"thread_id\": thread_id}}\n\nprint(\"--- Starting Graph ---\")\n# 7. Invoke the\n graph. It will run until it hits the interrupt() call.\nfor event in app.stream({\"task\": \"Deploy\n a new feature\"}, config, stream_mode='values'):\n    print(f\"Event: {event}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n\n--- Graph Interrupted ---\")\n\n# 8. At this point, the graph is paused. You can check its\n state.\ncurrent_state = app.get_state(config)\nif current_state.next:\n    print\n(f\"Graph is waiting at node: {current_state.next}\")\n\n    # 9. Get the\n human's input\n    user_decision = input(\"Enter your decision (approve/reject): \")\n\n    print(f\"\\\nn--- Resuming graph with decision: '{user_decision}' ---\")\n    # 10. Resume the graph\n with Command(resume=...)\n    for event in app.stream(Command(resume=user_decision), config, stream_\nmode='values'):\n        print(f\"Event: {event}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Graph completed\n without interruption.\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Final State ---\")\nfinal_state = app.get_state(config)\n\nprint(final_state.values)\n\n```\n\n\n### How it Works\n\n1.  The graph starts and\n executes the `get_approval` node.\n2.  Inside `get_approval`, the `interrupt()` function is\n called, which pauses the graph and saves its state using the `InMemorySaver`.\n3.  The first `app\n.stream()` call finishes, and the application waits for the user's input.\n4.  After the user provides\n a decision, the application calls `app.stream()` again with the same `thread_id`.\n5.  \nThis time, instead of a regular input, a `Command(resume=user_decision)` is passed.\n6.  Lang\nGraph loads the saved state and passes the `user_decision` as the return value of the `interrupt()` call.\n\n7.  The `get_approval` node finishes its execution, and the graph continues to the `process_decision\n` node and then to the end.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">How do I find information about: LangGraph human interrupt resume how to use Python HumanInterrupt interrupt types Command resume 2026?</web-search>","timestamp":35657},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":35657},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769458327269-caa09a03257338","status":"completed","timestamp":35657},{"type":"message","content":"To implement a human-in-the-loop pattern in a LangGraph application, you can use the","timestamp":35657},{"type":"message","content":" `interrupt()` function to pause the graph's execution and wait for external input before proceeding.

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: PyTorch model loading multiprocessing stuck deadlock solution 2026</web-search>","output":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: PyTorch model loading multiprocessing stuck deadlock solution 2026</web-search>\nDeadlocks when loading PyTorch models with multiprocessing are a common issue, often stemming from how Python's `multiprocessing` module interacts with PyTorch's internal mechanisms and underlying libraries (like CUDA or OpenMP). Here are the key\n solutions and best practices for 2026 to prevent such deadlocks:\n\n### 1. Set the Multiprocessing Start Method to `spawn` or `forkserver`\n\nThe default `fork` start method on Unix-like systems\n can lead to deadlocks, especially when using CUDA or other resource-heavy libraries, due to a \"poison fork\" scenario where the child processes inherit the parent's state, including locks and initialized runtimes.\n\n*   **\n`spawn`**: This is the safest and most compatible method across all platforms (and the default on Windows and macOS). It starts a fresh Python interpreter process for each child, ensuring a clean state.\n*   **`forkserver`**:\n This method starts a server process at the beginning, which then forks new child processes upon request. The server process is single-threaded, making it safe for forking.\n\n**Solution:** Explicitly set the start method at the beginning of\n your main script.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n    except\n RuntimeError:\n        pass\n    # Your main code for model loading and multiprocessing goes here\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   `torch.multiprocessing` is a PyTorch-specific wrapper around Python's `multipro\ncessing` that is optimized for handling tensors and shared memory.\n*   `force=True` attempts to set the start method even if it has been set before, which can be useful in some interactive environments or complex setups.\n*\n   The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is crucial because `spawn` and `forkserver` require that the main module can be safely imported by child processes.\n\n### 2. Use `model.share_\nmemory_()` for Shared Models\n\nIf you intend to use the same model across multiple processes without creating separate copies, use `model.share_memory_()`. This allocates shared memory for the model's parameters, allowing all processes to\n access the same underlying data.\n\n**Solution:** Call `share_memory_()` on your model after loading it in the main process and before passing it to child processes.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nclass MyModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)\n\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(x)\n\ndef worker_function(model, input_data):\n    # Perform inference or other operations with the shared model\n    output = model(\ninput_data)\n    print(f\"Worker output: {output.mean().item()}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n\n    #\n Load model in the main process\n    model = MyModel()\n    # Optional: Load pre-trained weights\n    # model.load_state_dict(torch.load('my_model_weights.pth'))\n\n    \n# Move model to shared memory\n    model.share_memory_()\n\n    # Example usage with multiprocessing\n    processes = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        dummy_input = torch.randn(5,\n 10)\n        p = mp.Process(target=worker_function, args=(model, dummy_input))\n        processes.append(p)\n        p.start()\n\n    for p in processes:\n        p\n.join()\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Avoid Initializing CUDA/Accelerators Before Forking\n\nWhen using `fork` (which is the default on some systems), initializing CUDA or other accelerator runtimes in the parent process before child\n processes are spawned can lead to deadlocks or runtime errors.\n\n**Solution:** Ensure that any CUDA-related operations or accelerator initializations happen *after* the child processes have been spawned, typically within the worker function itself. If you must\n initialize in the parent, use `spawn` or `forkserver`.\n\n### 4. Manage `num_workers` in `DataLoader` and `torch.set_num_threads()`\n\nDeadlocks can occur in `DataLoader\n` when `num_workers` is set too high, leading to CPU oversubscription or conflicts with underlying multithreading libraries like OpenMP (used by PyTorch for CPU operations).\n\n**Solution:**\n*   **Optimize `num_\nworkers`**: Experiment with different values for `num_workers` in your `DataLoader`. A common recommendation is to set it to the number of CPU cores or slightly less. If deadlocks persist, try `num_workers=0\n` as a diagnostic step (this disables multiprocessing for data loading).\n*   **Set `torch.set_num_threads(1)`**: If you suspect OpenMP or MKL conflicts, especially when using the `fork` start method\n, setting `torch.set_num_threads(1)` in the child processes (or even in the parent before forking) can resolve deadlocks.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader,\n Dataset\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nclass MyDataset(Dataset):\n    def __len__(self):\n        return 100\n\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        return torch.randn\n(10)\n\ndef train_loop(dataloader):\n    # In a worker process, you might want to limit threads\n    torch.set_num_threads(1) # Important for preventing deadlocks with OpenMP/\nMKL\n    for i, data in enumerate(dataloader):\n        if i % 10 == 0:\n            print(f\"Worker received batch {i}\")\n        # ... training logic ...\n\nif __name__ == '__\nmain__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n\n    dataset = MyDataset()\n    # Adjust num_workers based on your system's CPU cores and experimentation\n    dataloader = DataLoader(\ndataset, batch_size=4, num_workers=4)\n\n    # If you are running the training loop in the main process,\n    # you might still want to set num_threads if you have other multiprocessing\n    \n# components that could conflict.\n    # torch.set_num_threads(1)\n\n    train_loop(dataloader)\n\n```\n\n\n### 5. Use `multiprocessing.SimpleQueue` if `multiprocessing\n.Queue` is Problematic\n\n`multiprocessing.Queue` can sometimes cause deadlocks due to its internal threads. If you are using queues for inter-process communication and suspect them to be the source of deadlocks, consider \n`multiprocessing.SimpleQueue`.\n\n**Solution:** Replace `mp.Queue()` with `mp.SimpleQueue()` if you encounter issues.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\ndef worker_with_simple_queue(\nq):\n    message = q.get()\n    print(f\"Worker received: {message}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n\n\n    q = mp.SimpleQueue() # Use SimpleQueue\n    p = mp.Process(target=worker_with_simple_queue, args=(q,))\\\n    p.start()\n    q.put(\"Hello\n from main process!\")\n    p.join()\n\n```\n\n\nBy carefully applying these solutions, especially by choosing the appropriate multiprocessing start method and managing shared resources, you can effectively mitigate deadlocks when loading PyTorch models with multiprocessing.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: PyTorch model loading multiprocessing stuck deadlock solution 2026</web-search>","timestamp":31128},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":31128},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769458384960-22d74f2190ecf","status":"completed","timestamp":31128},{"type":"message","content":"Deadlocks when loading PyTorch models with multiprocessing are a common issue, often stemming from how Python's `multiprocessing` module interacts with PyTorch's internal mechanisms and underlying libraries (like CUDA or OpenMP).

It allows HTTP Parameter Pollution (\nHPP) due to the use of `Math.random()` for generating boundary values in multipart form-encoded data. Attackers could predict these values to bypass security controls or manipulate data.\n\n**CVE-2025-5\n8754**:\nThis vulnerability impacts Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, specifically in versions prior to 1.11.0 (and also prior to 0.30.2 and 1.12.0\n) when running on Node.js. It can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the Node.js process. This occurs because Axios decodes `data:` scheme URLs into memory without enforcing size limitations, causing uncontrolled memory\n allocation. It has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High).\n\n**CVE-2024-37890**:\nThis denial-of-service vulnerability affects `ws`, an open-source WebSocket client and\n server for Node.js. A request containing an excessive number of headers (exceeding `server.maxHeadersCount`) can crash the `ws` server. This issue has been resolved in `ws@8.17.1\n` and backported to `ws@7.5.10`, `ws@6.2.3`, and `ws@5.2.4`. Workarounds include reducing `max-http-header-size` or setting\n `server.maxHeadersCount` to 0.\n\n**Langfuse Vulnerabilities**:\n*   **CVE-2025-65107**: Affects Langfuse versions from 2.95.0\n to before 2.95.12 and from 3.17.0 to before 3.131.0.

Since gradients themselves cannot be directly transitioned, a common technique is to animate the opacity or size of a pseudo-element containing the gradient.\n\nHere\n's a CSS example demonstrating this effect:\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device\n-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Radial Gradient Text Hover Effect</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: center;\n            \nalign-items: center;\n            min-height: 100vh;\n            background-color: #1a1a1a;\n            font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana,\n sans-serif;\n            margin: 0;\n        }\n\n        .gradient-text-container {\n            font-size: 5em;\n            font-weight: bold;\n            position: relative;\n\n            display: inline-block; /* Ensures the container wraps the text */\n            cursor: pointer;\n            line-height: 1;\n        }\n\n        .gradient-text {\n            background-image: linear-\ngradient(45deg, #ff7e5f, #feb47b); /* Initial linear gradient */\n            -webkit-background-clip: text; /* For Chrome-based browsers */\n            background-clip:\n text;\n            color: transparent; /* Makes the text transparent to show the background gradient */\n            transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Fallback transition for color if gradient transition isn't supported\n */\n            position: relative;\n            z-index: 2; /* Ensure text is above the pseudo-element initially */\n        }\n\n        .gradient-text-container::before {\n            content: attr(data\n-text); /* Use the text content from a data attribute */\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 1\n00%;\n            background-image: radial-gradient(circle at center, #a8ff78 0%, #78ffd6 100%); /* Radial gradient for hover */\n            -webkit-background\n-clip: text; /* For Chrome-based browsers */\n            background-clip: text;\n            color: transparent;\n            opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n            transition: opacity 0.5s ease\n-in-out, transform 0.5s ease-in-out;\n            transform: scale(0.9); /* Slightly scale down initially */\n            z-index: 1; /* Below the main text initially\n */\n        }\n\n        .gradient-text-container:hover .gradient-text {\n            /* On hover, you might want to subtly change the base gradient or keep it */\n            /* For this effect, we primarily animate\n the pseudo-element */\n        }\n\n        .gradient-text-container:hover::before {\n            opacity: 1; /* Reveal the radial gradient on hover */\n            transform: scale(1); /* Scale to original\n size */\n            z-index: 3; /* Bring the radial gradient to the front on hover */\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"gradient-text-container\"\n data-text=\"HOVER ME\">\n        <span class=\"gradient-text\">HOVER ME</span>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **HTML Structure:**\n    *   A\n `div` with class `gradient-text-container` acts as a wrapper for the text.

{"id":"websearch-1330","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Implement full width responsive image slider with Next.js Image component and Swiper 2026</web-search>","output":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Implement full width responsive image slider with Next.js Image component and Swiper 2026</web-search>\nThe current\n information on implementing a full-width responsive image slider with Next.js Image component and Swiper is provided below.\n\n**1. Install Swiper**\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n# or\nyarn add swiper\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Create the Image Slider Component**\n\nCreate a new file, for example, `components/ImageSlider.js` (or `.tsx` for TypeScript), and add the following code:\n\n\n```javascript\n// components/\nImageSlider.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, A11y } from 'swiper/modules';\n\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport 'swiper/css/autoplay\n';\n\nconst images = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    src: '/images/slide1.jpg', // Make sure these paths are correct in your public folder\n    alt: 'Slider Image 1\n',\n    width: 1920, // Provide actual width of your image\n    height: 1080, // Provide actual height of your image\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n\n    src: '/images/slide2.jpg',\n    alt: 'Slider Image 2',\n    width: 1920,\n    height: 1080,\n  },\n  {\n\n    id: 3,\n    src: '/images/slide3.jpg',\n    alt: 'Slider Image 3',\n    width: 1920,\n    height: 1080\n,\n  },\n];\n\nconst ImageSlider = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"image-slider-container\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, A1\n1y]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{\n          delay: 5000,\n          disableOnInteraction: false,\n        \n}}\n        loop={true}\n        className=\"mySwiper\"\n      >\n        {images.map((image) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={image.id}>\n            <div className=\"image\n-slide\">\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                layout=\"fill\" // Makes the image fill the parent div\n                objectFit=\"cover\" // Covers the area\n without distorting aspect ratio\n                priority={true} // Prioritize loading for the first image\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport\n default ImageSlider;\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Add Images to Your Public Folder**\n\nCreate an `images` folder inside your Next.js `public` directory (e.g., `public/images/`) and place your slider\n images (e.g., `slide1.jpg`, `slide2.jpg`, `slide3.jpg`) there.\n\n**4. Add Global Styles**\n\nTo ensure the slider is full-width and responsive, you'\nll need to add some global CSS. You can add this to your `globals.css` file or a dedicated CSS module.\n\n\n```css\n/* styles/globals.css or a dedicated CSS file */\n\n/* Ensure the main container\n takes full width */\n.image-slider-container {\n  width: 100%;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide any overflow from images */\n}\n\n/* Swiper container */\n.mySwiper {\n\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 600px; /* Adjust height as needed for your design */\n  /* For responsive height based on aspect ratio, you might use padding-bottom trick */\n\n  /* Example for 16:9 aspect ratio: */\n  /* padding-bottom: 56.25%; */\n  /* height: 0; */\n  /* position: relative; */\n}\n\n\n/* Individual slide container for Next.js Image */\n.image-slide {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%; /* Important for layout=\"fill\" to\n work */\n}\n\n/* Swiper navigation buttons (optional, customize as needed) */\n.swiper-button-next,\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: #fff; /* Example color */\n  /*\n Add more styling for position, size, background etc. */\n}\n\n/* Swiper pagination dots (optional, customize as needed) */\n.swiper-pagination-bullet {\n  background-color: #fff; /* Example color\n */\n  opacity: 0.7;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  background-color: #007aff; /* Example active color */\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\n\n/* Responsive adjustments */\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  .mySwiper {\n    height: 400px; /* Adjust height for smaller screens */\n  }\n\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n  .mySwiper {\n    height: 300px; /* Further adjust height for mobile */\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**5.\n Use the Component on a Page**\n\nNow you can import and use the `ImageSlider` component on any of your Next.js pages (e.g., `pages/index.js`):\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/\nindex.js\nimport ImageSlider from '../components/ImageSlider';\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <main>\n        <ImageSlider />\n        {/* Other page content */}\n\n        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>\n        <p>This is some content below the slider.</p>\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`Swiper\n` Component:** The main container for the slider. We import `Navigation`, `Pagination`, `Autoplay`, and `A11y` modules for common slider features.\n*   **`SwiperSlide`:** Each image is\n wrapped in a `SwiperSlide` component.\n*   **`next/image`:** Inside each `SwiperSlide`, we use Next.js's `Image` component.\n    *   `layout=\"fill\"\n`: This is crucial for making the image fill its parent container.\n    *   `objectFit=\"cover\"`: Ensures the image covers the entire area of the `div` without being stretched, cropping parts of the image if necessary.\n\n    *   `priority={true}`: Recommended for the first image in the viewport to optimize loading.\n*   **`image-slide` div:** This `div` acts as the parent for the `next/image\n` component. It needs `position: relative` and `width: 100%; height: 100%;` for `layout=\"fill\"` to work correctly.\n*   **CSS (`.mySwiper` and\n `.image-slider-container`):**\n    *   `width: 100%` on `.image-slider-container` and `.mySwiper` ensures the slider takes the full available width.\n    *\n   A fixed `height` (e.g., `600px`) is set on `.mySwiper`. You can adjust this or implement a responsive height using the `padding-bottom` trick if you want to maintain a\n specific aspect ratio.\n    *   Media queries are included to adjust the height of the slider on different screen sizes, making it responsive.\n\nThis setup provides a robust, performant, and responsive image slider using Next.js Image optimization\n and Swiper's powerful features.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Implement full width responsive image slider with Next.js Image component and Swiper 2026</web-search>","timestamp":28719},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":28719},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769458903595-7e5045e0ec8cf","status":"completed","timestamp":28719},{"type":"message","content":"The current","timestamp":28719},{"type":"message","content":" information on implementing a full-width responsive image slider with Next.js Image component and Swiper is provided below.\n\n**1.

{"id":"websearch-1594","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Workers AI binding usage pattern examples 2026</web-search>","output":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Workers AI binding usage pattern examples 2026</web-search>\nCloudflare Workers AI bindings enable Workers and Pages Functions to interact with Cloudflare's AI models and AI Gateway. These bindings are configured in `wrangler.toml` or `wrangler.jsonc` and\n accessed via the `env` object in your Worker code.\n\nHere are the common usage patterns for Workers AI bindings in 2026:\n\n### 1. Basic Workers AI Binding for Model Inference\n\nThis pattern is for running\n AI models directly on Cloudflare's edge network.\n\n**`wrangler.toml` configuration:**\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\" # This makes the AI binding available as env.AI in your Worker\n\n\n```\n\nor in `wrangler.jsonc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json\",\n  \"ai\": {\n    \"binding\": \"AI\"\n\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**Worker (`index.ts` or `index.js`) usage:**\nAccess AI models through `env.AI.run()`, specifying the model and input.\n\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Env {\n\n  AI: Ai; // Assuming 'AI' is the binding name from wrangler.toml\n}\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {\n    const prompt = \"\nWhat is the capital of France?\";\n    const answer = await env.AI.run(\n      \"@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct\", // Example model\n      { prompt }\n    );\n\n\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(answer), {\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  },\n} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;\n\n```\n\n\n**Streaming Responses:**\n\nFor models that support it, you can enable streaming for real-time results.\n\n\n```typescript\n// ... inside your fetch handler\nconst stream = await env.AI.run(\n  \"@cf/meta/llama-3\n.1-8b-instruct\",\n  { prompt: \"Tell me a story about a brave knight.\", stream: true }\n);\n\nreturn new Response(stream, {\n  headers: { \"content-type\": \"\ntext/event-stream\" },\n});\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Integrating with AI Gateway for Advanced Features\n\nThe AI Gateway provides a unified API for various AI providers and offers features like logging, caching, and analytics.\n\n**\n`wrangler.toml` configuration (same as basic AI binding):**\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n```\n\n\n**Worker (`index.ts` or `index.js`) usage with AI Gateway\n:**\nWhen using AI Gateway, specify the `gateway` option in the `env.AI.run()` method.\n\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Env {\n  AI: Ai;\n}\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch\n(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {\n    const gatewayId = \"my-ai-gateway\"; // Replace with your AI Gateway ID\n    const prompt = \"Generate a short poem about the ocean.\";\n\n\n    const response = await env.AI.run(\n      \"@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast\",\n      { prompt },\n      {\n        gateway: {\n          id\n: gatewayId,\n          skipCache: false, // Optional: control caching behavior\n        },\n      }\n    );\n\n    // Accessing the latest request log ID from AI Gateway\n    const myLogId = env.\nAI.aiGatewayLogId;\n    console.log(\"AI Gateway Log ID:\", myLogId);\n\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response), {\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/\njson\" },\n    });\n  },\n} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;\n\n```\n\n\n**Accessing specific AI Gateway methods:**\nYou can also access specific methods of your AI Gateway binding for more granular control, such as sending\n feedback or retrieving log details.\n\n\n```typescript\nexport interface Env {\n  AI: Ai;\n}\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {\n    const gatewayId =\n \"my-ai-gateway\";\n    const gateway = env.AI.gateway(gatewayId);\n\n    // Example: Sending feedback to a log entry\n    const logIdToUpdate = \"some-previous-log-id\n\"; // Obtained from a prior AI.run() or other means\n    await gateway.patchLog(logIdToUpdate, {\n      feedback: 1, // Positive feedback\n      score: 90,\n      metadata\n: { user: \"user-123\", sentiment: \"positive\" },\n    });\n\n    // Example: Retrieving log details\n    const logDetails = await gateway.getLog(logIdToUpdate);\n    \nconsole.log(\"Log Details:\", logDetails);\n\n    // Example: Getting a provider-specific URL for SDK integration\n    const openaiUrl = await gateway.getUrl(\"openai\");\n    console.log(\"OpenAI compatible URL:\",\n openaiUrl);\n\n    return new Response(\"AI Gateway operations performed.\", { status: 200 });\n  },\n} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. AI Search (formerly AutoRAG)\n Binding\n\nFor applications requiring search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), you can bind to AI Search.\n\n**`wrangler.toml` configuration:**\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n```\n\n\n\n**Worker (`index.ts` or `index.js`) usage:**\nInteract with your named AI Search instance using `env.AI.autorag(\"your-ai-search-name\").aiSearch()`.\n\n\n```typescript\n\nexport interface Env {\n  AI: Ai;\n}\n\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {\n    const aiSearchName = \"my-knowledge-base\";\n // Replace with your AI Search name\n    const query = \"How do I train a llama to deliver coffee?\";\n\n    const answer = await env.AI.autorag(aiSearchName).aiSearch({\n      query: query,\n      \nmodel: \"@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast\", // Specify a generation model\n      rewrite_query: true,\n      max_num_results: 2,\n\n      ranking_options: {\n        score_threshold: 0.3,\n      },\n      reranking: {\n        enabled: true,\n        model: \"@cf/baai/bge-reranker\n-base\",\n      },\n      stream: true,\n    });\n\n    return new Response(answer, {\n      headers: { \"content-type\": \"text/event-stream\" },\n    });\n  },\n\n} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;\n\n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Workers AI binding usage pattern examples 2026</web-search>","timestamp":23431},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":23431},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769459191886-ad02d11914ae08","status":"completed","timestamp":23431},{"type":"message","content":"Cloudflare Workers AI bindings enable Workers and Pages Functions to interact with Cloudflare's AI models and AI Gateway.

mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: 锁定效应 lock-in effect 路径依赖 竞争壁垒 难以模仿 2026</web-search>\n锁定效应（Lock-in Effect）、路径依赖（Path Dependence）、竞争\n壁垒（Competitive Barrier）和难以模仿（Difficult to Imitate）是经济学和商业策略中紧密相关的\n概念，它们共同解释了企业或系统如何通过历史选择和自我强化机制获得并维持竞争优势。\n\n**1\n. 路径依赖 (Path Dependence)**\n路径依赖是指在给定条件下，人们的决策选择会受到其过去的\n决策经验和既有收益的影响，即使过去的境况可能已经过时或不再适用于现有境况。它\n强调了历史因素在系统演进中的作用，以及初始选择对后续发展轨迹的深远影响[9\n, 10]。这种演进过程通过自我强化机制（如规模经济、预期效应、投资和学习\n效应）得以维持，使得系统发展呈现出S形曲线，并可能导致稳定性或锁定状态[11]。Q\nWERTY键盘的普及就是一个经典案例，尽管存在更高效的键盘布局，但其早期广泛采用使其成为难以\n改变的标准[5, 8, 10]。\n\n**2. 锁定效应 (Lock-in Effect)**\n\n锁定效应是路径依赖的一种表现或结果，指的是一旦某种行为模式或选择形成，就很难改变，即使存在更\n优的替代方案。这主要是由于转换成本高昂、沉没成本、学习效应和网络效应等因素造成的[\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5]。一旦进入“锁定”状态，企业或用户\n就难以轻易退出原有路径[7, 8]。例如，用户从一个互联网平台转向另一个平台时，由于转移\n成本较高，从而对原平台产生一种依赖效果，形成平台锁定效应[6]。\n\n**3. 竞争壁\n垒 (Competitive Barrier)**\n竞争壁垒（或进入壁垒）是指阻碍潜在竞争者进入市场并降低\n其对现有企业威胁的各种因素。它体现了现有企业相对于潜在进入者的优势程度，并对市场结构\n和竞争关系产生重要影响[12, 13, 14]。竞争壁垒的来源多样，包括\n规模经济、必要的资本投入、沉没成本、产品差异化、绝对成本优势、政策法规以及现有企业的\n战略性阻止行为等[12]。\n\n**4. 难以模仿 (Difficult to Imitate)**\n“难以模仿”\n指的是企业所拥有的、竞争对手难以复制的独特特征或能力。这种难以模仿性是构建强大竞争壁垒的关键\n要素。\n\n**相互关系与2026年的相关性**\n这些概念之间存在紧密的逻辑链条：\n\n*   **路径依赖**是基础，它解释了历史选择如何塑造当前格局。\n*   **锁定效应\n**是路径依赖的直接结果，即一旦选择了某个路径，就可能被“锁定”在该路径上，难以改变\n。\n*   当企业或系统因路径依赖和锁定效应而形成独特的、难以被复制的优势时，这些\n优势就构成了强大的**竞争壁垒**。\n*   **难以模仿**的特质是构成有效\n竞争壁垒的核心要素。一个企业如果能构建起难以模仿的商业模式、技术或品牌体验，就能\n有效阻止竞争对手的进入和威胁。\n\n展望2026年，这些概念在当前快速变化的商业\n环境中依然具有高度相关性：\n*   在零售行业，品牌通过深度用户洞察和敏捷服务\n响应构建的、**难以模仿**的全域智能营销体系，将成为其核心**竞争壁垒**[18\n]。\n*   在AI领域，尽管技术创新迅速，但由于开源模式的普及，使得技术创新**\n难以沉淀为持久的竞争壁垒**，竞争烈度空前[16]。\n*   国家间的\n经济竞争也体现了这些原则。例如，中国通过政策支持和引导研发投入，推动企业突破技术**壁\n垒**，形成了美国**难以模仿**的独特经济活力和韧性[19]。\n*   能源\n转型等长期战略投资中，历史**路径依赖**和**锁定效应**是政策制定者需要考虑的关键\n因素，以避免锁定在非期望的技术中[11]。\n*   在文商旅综合体等\n项目中，通过系统性的商业策划构建涵盖灵魂、品牌、业态、空间、运营等多维度的差异化体系\n，才能铸就坚实的**竞争壁垒**[15]。\n\n总而言之，在2026\n年及未来，理解并有效利用路径依赖、锁定效应、竞争壁垒和难以模仿这些概念，对于企业\n制定长期战略、应对市场竞争以及在技术变革中保持领先地位至关重要。","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search

{"id":"websearch-1909","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: HAPP proxy \"Allow connections from LAN\" SOCKS5 port antidetect browser setup 2026</web-search>","output":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: HAPP proxy \"Allow connections from LAN\" SOCKS5 port antidetect browser setup 2026</web-search>\nHere is a guide on how to set up an HAProxy instance to act as a S\nOCKS5 proxy that allows connections from your LAN, and how to configure an antidetect browser to use this setup.\n\n### Part\n 1: Setting up HAProxy as a SOCKS5 Gateway for your LAN\n\nThis configuration will allow you to run\n HAProxy on one machine and have other devices on your local network connect to it as a SOCKS5 proxy.\n\n**\n1. HAProxy Configuration (`haproxy.cfg`)**\n\nBelow is an example `haproxy.cfg` file.\n You will need to either create this file or add the `listen` block to your existing configuration.\n\n\n```ini\nglobal\n\n    log /dev/log    local0\n    log /dev/log    local1 notice\n    chroot /\nvar/lib/haproxy\n    stats socket /run/haproxy/admin.sock mode 66\n0 level admin expose-fd listeners\n    stats timeout 30s\n    user haproxy\n    group haproxy\n\n    daemon\n\ndefaults\n    log     global\n    mode    tcp\n    option  tcplog\n    option\n  dontlognull\n    timeout connect 5000\n    timeout client  50000\n    timeout\n server  50000\n\nlisten socks5_proxy\n    bind *:1080\n    mode\n tcp\n    # Define an ACL to match your LAN subnet.\n    # Replace 192.168.\n1.0/24 with your actual LAN subnet.\n    acl lan_network src 192.1\n68.1.0/24\n    # Allow connections only if they originate from the defined LAN network\n\n    tcp-request content accept if lan_network\n    # Deny all other connections\n    tcp-request content deny\n\n\n```\n\n\n**Key Configuration Explanation:**\n\n*   `bind *:1080`: This tells HAProxy to listen\n on all network interfaces on port `1080`. This is what allows other devices on your LAN to connect to it\n.\n*   `mode tcp`: This puts HAProxy in TCP mode, which is necessary for it to handle SOCKS5 traffic\n.\n*   `acl lan_network src 192.168.1.0/24`:\n This is an Access Control List that defines your Local Area Network. **You must change `192.168\n.1.0/24` to match your LAN's subnet.** For example, if your router's IP address\n is `10.0.0.1`, your subnet is likely `10.0.0.0\n/24`.\n*   `tcp-request content accept if lan_network`: This rule accepts connections from IP\n addresses that match the `lan_network` ACL.\n*   `tcp-request content deny`: This rule denies all\n other connections, ensuring only devices on your LAN can use the proxy.\n\n**2. Restart HAProxy**\n\nAfter\n saving your `haproxy.cfg` file, you need to restart the HAProxy service for the changes to take\n effect. The command to do this depends on your operating system. Here are some common examples:\n\n*   **For\n systems using `systemd` (like modern Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS):**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo systemctl restart\n haproxy\n    \n```\n\n*   **For systems using `service`:**\n    \n```bash\n    sudo service\n haproxy restart\n    \n```\n\n\n### Part 2: Configuring Your Antidetect Browser\n\nNow that you have your\n HAProxy instance running, you can configure your antidetect browser to use it. The following steps are general and should\n apply to most antidetect browsers.\n\n1.  **Create or Edit a Browser Profile:** In your antidetect browser\n, either create a new profile or edit an existing one.\n\n2.  **Navigate to Proxy Settings:** Find the \"\nProxy\" or \"Network\" section within the profile settings.\n\n3.  **Enter Proxy Details:**\n    *   **\nProxy Type:** Select `SOCKS5`.\n    *   **Host/IP Address:** Enter the IP address of the computer\n running HAProxy. This will be a local network IP, like `192.168.1.\n10` or `10.0.0.5`. You can find this by running `ifconfig` or\n `ip addr` on the machine running HAProxy.\n    *   **Port:** Enter `1080\n` (the port you configured in `haproxy.cfg`).\n    *   **Username/Password:** Leave these\n fields blank, as we have not configured any authentication in HAProxy.\n\n4.  **Test the Proxy Connection:**\n Most antidetect browsers have a \"Test Proxy\" or \"Check Connection\" button. Use this to verify that the browser\n can connect to your HAProxy instance.\n\n5.  **Save and Launch:** Save the profile and launch it.

Clear and Concise Overview**\n\n*   **Prominent Confirmation Number\n:** Display the booking confirmation number clearly at the top of the page.\n*   **Overall Summary:** Provide a high-level summary\n of the entire booking, including the total number of rooms, total guests, overall check-in/check-out dates\n, and the grand total cost.\n*   **Hotel Information:** Clearly state the hotel name, address, and contact\n information.\n\n### **2. Individual Room Breakdown**\n\n*   **Distinct Sections for Each Room:** Dedicate a clearly\n delineated section for each room booked. This could be achieved using cards, expandable accordions, or distinct headings for each room\n.\n*   **Room-Specific Details:** Within each room's section, include:\n    *   **Room Type\n:** Clearly state the type of room (e.g., \"Deluxe King,\" \"Standard Double\").\n    *   **Guest\n Names:** List the primary guest(s) assigned to that specific room.\n    *   **Check-in/\nCheck-out Dates (if different per room):** If the booking allows for varying dates per room, ensure these are explicitly stated\n for each.\n    *   **Room-Specific Price:** Show the cost associated with that individual room.\n    *   **\nInclusions/Exclusions:** Detail any specific amenities, meal plans, or services included or excluded for that room.\n    \n*   **Cancellation Policy (if different per room):** If cancellation policies vary by room type or rate, present the\n relevant policy for each.\n\n### **3. Guest Information per Room**\n\n*   **Clear Guest Assignment:** Make\n it unambiguous which guests are assigned to which room. This is crucial for multi-room bookings where different groups or individuals might occupy\n separate rooms.\n*   **Guest Details:** For each room, display the names of the guests staying in it.\n\n\n### **4. Comprehensive Financial Summary**\n\n*   **Itemized Cost Breakdown:** Present a detailed breakdown of costs, including:\n\n    *   Price per room per night.\n    *   Any additional charges (e.g., taxes, resort\n fees, extra guest fees).\n    *   Discounts or promotional codes applied.\n    *   Total cost for each room\n.\n    *   Grand total for the entire booking.\n*   **Payment Information:** Clearly state the payment method used and any\n amount already paid or due upon arrival.\n\n### **5. Important Policies and Information**\n\n*   **Cancellation Policy:**\n Reiterate the overall cancellation policy or link to a detailed policy page. For multi-room bookings, ensure any specific conditions\n related to canceling individual rooms are clear.[1][2]\n*   **Check-in/Check-out Times:** Clearly\n state the standard check-in and check-out times.\n*   **Hotel Amenities/Services:** Briefly mention key\n hotel amenities or services, or provide a link to the hotel's services page.\n*   **FAQ Section:** Include a\n concise FAQ section to address common questions, especially those pertinent to multi-room bookings (e.g., how to modify\n guest names, adding extra nights to one room).[1]\n\n### **6. Call to Action and Next Steps**\n\n*\n   **Print/Email Confirmation:** Provide clear options to print the confirmation or have it emailed.\n*   **Modify\n/Cancel Booking:** Offer prominent, easy-to-find links or buttons to modify or cancel the reservation, along with any associated\n conditions.\n*   **Add to Calendar:** A convenient option to add the booking details to a digital calendar.\n\n*   **Contact Hotel:** Easy access to the hotel's contact information for any queries.\n\n### **7. Mobile\n Optimization**\n\n*   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the confirmation page is fully responsive and easily navigable on all devices, including smartphones\n and tablets.[3][1][4][2]\n*   **Large, Tappable Buttons:** Use appropriately\n sized buttons for mobile users.[3]\n*   **Simplified Layout:** On smaller screens, consider collapsing less critical information into\n expandable sections to maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.\n\n### **8. Personalization and Branding**\n\n*   \n**Personalized Greeting:** Address the guest by name.[4][2]\n*   **Brand Consistency:** Maintain consistent\n branding (colors, fonts, logo) with the rest of the hotel's website to reinforce trust and recognition.[1\n][2]\n\nBy implementing these UI patterns, a multi-room hotel booking confirmation page can effectively convey all necessary information, reduce\n user confusion, and enhance the overall guest experience.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[1] theorangestudio.com\n\n[2] qloapps.com\n[3] youtube.com\n[4] moldstud.com","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">How do I find information about: multi-room hotel booking confirmation page UI patterns show all rooms details 2026?</web-search>","timestamp":32945},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":32945},{"type":"tool_call","name":"you-search-1769459912809-0f1e772bda61b8","status":"completed","timestamp":32945},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":32945},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769459916781-d72f171c95e018","status":"completed","timestamp":32945},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the web search results, here are key UI patterns and best practices for creating a multi-room hotel booking confirmation page","timestamp":32945},{"type":"message","content":" that shows all room details:\n\n### **1.
