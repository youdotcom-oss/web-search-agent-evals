Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Solutions for SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL with curl and Korean Government Sites\n\n### Common Causes\nThe SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL error typically occurs when:\n- SSL certificate verification fails\n- The client cannot verify the server's certificate\n- There are certificate chain issues\n- Outdated SSL/TLS protocols are in use\n\n### Solutions for curl\n\n**Method 1: Disable SSL verification for specific command**\n```bash\ncurl --insecure -O https://www.gov-site.kr/file.pdf\n# or using short option\ncurl -k -O https://www.gov-site.kr/file.pdf\n```\n\n**Method 2: Configure curl globally via .curlrc**\n```bash\necho \"insecure\" > ~/.curlrc\n```\n\nThis creates a configuration file that tells curl to skip certificate verification for all requests.\n\n### Solutions for Other Tools\n\n**For wget:**\n```bash\nwget --no-check-certificate https://gov-site.kr/file.pdf\n# or configure globally\necho \"check-certificate = off\" >> ~/.wgetrc\n```\n\n**For git operations:**\n```bash\ngit config --global http.sslVerify false\n```\n\n### Best Practices (According to 2026 Guidelines)\n\nAccording to the Korean government site error resolution guide from 2026:\n\n1. **Network connectivity check** - Verify your internet connection is stable\n2. **Clear browser cache/cookies** - Remove cached SSL certificates\n3. **Update certificates** - Ensure your system's CA certificates are up to date\n4. **Try with proper CA certificate** - If possible, install the government site's CA certificate:\n   ```bash\n   /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl s_client -connect gov-site.kr:443\n   ```\n\n### Important Security Note\nDisabling SSL verification (`--insecure` or `-k`) should only be used temporarily for troubleshooting. It exposes you to man-in-the-middle attacks. The proper solution is to:\n\n1. Install the required CA certificate in your system's trusted certificate store\n2. Update your system's CA bundle\n3.
