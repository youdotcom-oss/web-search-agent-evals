{"id":"websearch-2","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","output":"Based on the comprehensive research I've conducted using the You.com search tools, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026:\n\n## Best Landing Page Strategies for 2026\n\n### Core Landing Page Elements\n1. **Clear Value Proposition** - Communicate your core value immediately above the fold with a bold headline\n2. **Single Call-to-Action (CTA)** - Focus on one primary action to reduce decision fatigue\n3. **Social Proof** - Include testimonials, recognizable company logos, and user success stories\n4. **Mobile-First Design** - Prioritize mobile experience as primary traffic source\n5. **Fast Loading Times** - Optimize all assets for performance\n\n### Conversion-Focused Strategies\n- **Progressive Disclosure** - Don't overwhelm users; reveal information as they scroll\n- **Trust Signals Early** - Place security badges, certifications, and guarantees prominently\n- **Strategic Color Use** - Maintain contrast between CTAs and background (3:1 minimum ratio)\n- **Scannable Content** - Use bullet points, short paragraphs, and clear headings since users scan rather than read\n- **FAQ Section** - Address objections proactively to reduce hesitation\n\n## Responsive Gallery Design Patterns for 2026\n\n### Layout Patterns\n1. **CSS Grid with Auto-Fit** - Automatically adjusts columns based on screen size\n   - Use `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))`\n   \n2. **Flexbox Masonry** - Creates Pinterest-style layouts that adapt fluidly\n   - Implements multi-column layouts that reflow naturally\n\n3. **Card-Based Grid** - Uniform card sizes that stack vertically on mobile\n   - Typically 3-4 columns on desktop → 2 columns on tablet → 1 column on mobile\n\n4. **Lazy Loading** - Load images as users scroll to improve initial page load\n   - Use native `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute or Intersection Observer API\n\n### Best Practices\n- **Aspect Ratio Preservation** - Use `aspect-ratio` CSS property to prevent layout shift\n- **Touch-Friendly Spacing** - Minimum 44x44px touch targets on mobile\n- **Lightbox/Modal View** - Allow users to view full-resolution images without leaving page\n- **Alt Text & Accessibility** - Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes\n\n## Responsive Pricing Table Patterns for 2026\n\n### Key Design Strategies\n\n**1. Three-Tier Standard**\n- Stick to 3 pricing plans to avoid overwhelming users\n- More than 4 options creates decision paralysis\n\n**2. Highlight the Recommended Plan**\n- Use visual distinction (color, badge, size) for your target tier\n- Label it \"Most Popular\" or \"Recommended\"\n- Place it in the center or use elevation/shadow effects\n\n**3. Left-to-Right Pricing Order**\n- Start with the most expensive plan on the left\n- Research shows users read left-to-right and this makes mid-tier options feel like better deals\n- Creates psychological anchoring effect\n\n**4. Responsive Transformation Patterns**\n\n   **Desktop (>1024px):**\n   - Horizontal row layout with 3-4 columns\n   - Side-by-side comparison\n   \n   **Tablet (768-1024px):**\n   - 2 columns or maintain 3 with reduced padding\n   - Scrollable horizontal if needed\n   \n   **Mobile (<768px):**\n   - Stack vertically into accordion\n   - OR use card-based swipe/carousel\n   - Show one full plan at a time with clear navigation\n\n**5. Feature Comparison Design**\n- Concise feature lists (5-7 key features visible)\n- Use checkmarks/icons instead of text where possible\n- Expandable \"See all features\" for detailed comparison\n- Sticky headers on scroll for context\n\n**6. Mobile-Specific Enhancements**\n- Toggle between monthly/annual billing at top (sticky position)\n- Large, thumb-friendly CTA buttons (min 48px height)\n- Currency localization based on user's location\n- Reduce feature comparison text on mobile\n\n### Visual Design Trends\n- **Minimal borders** - Use subtle shadows instead of heavy borders\n- **Neumorphism elements** - Soft shadows for depth without visual clutter\n- **Dynamic pricing** - Show annual savings in real-time when toggling\n- **Micro-interactions** - Subtle hover effects and animations for engagement\n\n### Conversion Optimization\n- **Clear CTAs** - Use action-oriented text: \"Start Free Trial\" vs \"Sign Up\"\n- **Urgency indicators** - \"Limited time\" or discount countdown (when genuine)\n- **Remove friction** - Display \"No credit card required\" for free trials\n- **Trust signals** - Money-back guarantees, free cancellation prominently displayed\n- **FAQ below pricing** - Address objections about billing, features, support\n\n### Technical Implementation\n```css\n/* Modern responsive pricing table pattern */\n.pricing-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));\n  gap: 2rem;\n  padding: 2rem;\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  .pricing-container {\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n    gap: 1.5rem;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text\n- Ensure pricing tables are keyboard navigable\n- Use semantic HTML (`<table>` or proper ARIA labels)\n- Screen reader-friendly feature lists\n\n## 2026-Specific Trends\n- **AI-powered personalization** - Show different pricing based on user behavior\n- **Dark mode support** - Offer theme toggle for both galleries and pricing\n- **Animated pricing transitions** - Smooth transitions when toggling billing periods\n- **Interactive feature demos** - Clickable features that show examples/tooltips\n\nSources:\n- [40 Best Landing Page Examples of 2026 (Unbounce)](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/best-landing-page-examples/)\n- [UI Design Trends 2026 (Landdding)](https://landdding.com/blog/ui-design-trends-2026)\n- [Responsive Design Best Practices 2026 (PxlPeak)](https://pxlpeak.com/blog/web-design/responsive-design-best-practices)\n- [SaaS Pricing Page Design Best Practices (Eleken)](https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/saas-pricing-page-design-8-best-practices-with-examples)\n- [Top 10 Responsive Layout Patterns (Octet Design)](https://octet.design/journal/responsive-layout-patterns/)\n- [Tailwind CSS Best Practices 2025-2026 (Frontend Tools)](https://www.frontendtools.tech/blog/tailwind-css-best-practices-design-system-patterns)\n- [Pricing Table Examples (Divi Flash)](https://diviflash.com/pricing-table-examples/)","hint":"A correct answer must describe current (2026) high-converting landing page principles (clear value proposition and CTA, scannable layouts, social proof, mobile-first performance and responsiveness) and apply them specifically to galleries and pricing tables by mentioning modern responsive patterns (e.g., card- or grid-based galleries, carousels, masonry or modular layouts;

GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai';\n\nconst genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(API_KEY);\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-pro' });\n\nconst result = await model.generateContent('Why is the sky blue?');\nconsole.log(result.response.text());\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';\n\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: GEMINI_API_KEY });\n\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-001',\n  contents: 'Why is the sky blue?',\n});\nconsole.log(response.text);\n```\n\n#### 2. **Streaming Responses**\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst result = await model.generateContentStream('Write a poem');\nfor await (const chunk of result.stream) {\n  console.log(chunk.text());\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({\n  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-001',\n  contents: 'Write a 100-word poem.',\n});\nfor await (const chunk of response) {\n  console.log(chunk.text);\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. **Chat Sessions**\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-pro' });\nconst chat = model.startChat();\n\nconst result1 = await chat.sendMessage('Hello');\nconst result2 = await chat.sendMessage('What did I just say?');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst chat = await ai.chats.create({\n  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-001',\n});\n\nconst response1 = await chat.sendMessage('Hello');\nconst response2 = await chat.sendMessage('What did I just say?');\n```\n\n#### 4. **File Upload**\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleAIFileManager } from '@google/generative-ai/server';\n\nconst fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(API_KEY);\nconst uploadResult = await fileManager.uploadFile('path/to/file.jpg', {\n  mimeType: 'image/jpeg',\n});\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst uploadedFile = await ai.files.upload({\n  path: 'path/to/file.jpg',\n  mimeType: 'image/jpeg',\n});\n```\n\n#### 5. **Function Calling**\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst tools = [{\n  functionDeclarations: [{\n    name: 'controlLight',\n    description: 'Control smart light',\n    parameters: { /* schema */ }\n  }]\n}];\n\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ \n  model: 'gemini-pro',\n  tools \n});\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-001',\n  contents: 'Dim the lights',\n  config: {\n    tools: [{\n      functionDeclarations: [{\n        name: 'controlLight',\n        parametersJsonSchema: { /* schema */ }\n      }]\n    }],\n    toolConfig: {\n      functionCallingConfig: {\n        mode: FunctionCallingConfigMode.ANY,\n        allowedFunctionNames: ['controlLight']\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Important Breaking Changes\n\n1. **Configuration Structure**: Safety settings and generation configs now go under a unified `config` parameter\n2. **Response Access**: Use `.text` instead of `.text()` \n3. **Model Names**: Update to Gemini 2.0 models (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash-001`)\n4. **Function Parameters**: Use `parametersJsonSchema` instead of `parameters`\n5. **Automatic Function Calling**: Now enabled by default\n\n### Vertex AI Support\n\nThe new SDK supports both Gemini Developer API and Vertex AI:\n\n```javascript\n// Vertex AI initialization\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({\n  vertexai: true,\n  project: 'your_project',\n  location: 'your_location',\n});\n```\n\n### Additional Features\n\nThe new SDK includes:\n- **Built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) support** (experimental)\n- **Real-time interactions** via `ai.live`\n- **Image generation** via `ai.models.generateImages()`\n- **Improved TypeScript support** with built-in type declarations\n\n### Migration Priority\n\nGoogle states: *\"The Google GenAI SDK is now in

{"id":"websearch-88","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","output":"Based on my search results, here's how to handle **memory state management** and **RAG context injection** in LangGraph for 2026:\n\n## Memory State Management in LangGraph\n\n### 1. **Checkpointers for State Persistence**\nLangGraph uses **checkpointers** to manage state across conversations and agent interactions:\n\n- **MemorySaver**: In-memory checkpointing for development/testing\n- **SqliteSaver**: Persistent storage using SQLite\n- **PostgresSaver**: Production-grade persistence with PostgreSQL\n- **MongoDB Integration**: Long-term memory with semantic search capabilities\n\n**Basic Implementation:**\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n\n# Initialize checkpointer\ncheckpointer = MemorySaver()\n\n# Build graph with memory\ngraph = StateGraph(state_schema)\ngraph.add_node(\"agent\", agent_node)\n# ... add other nodes and edges\n\n# Compile with checkpointer\napp = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n\n# Use with thread_id for conversation persistence\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"user_123\"}}\nresponse = app.invoke(input_data, config=config)\n```\n\n### 2. **Store API for Long-Term Memory**\nLangGraph introduced the **Store** abstraction for managing cross-thread memories:\n\n- Stores information that should persist across different conversation threads\n- Supports namespacing for different memory scopes (user-level, global, etc.)\n- Enables semantic search over stored memories\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Cross-conversation memory**: Remember facts about users across sessions\n- **Namespace organization**: Organize memories by user, topic, or context\n- **Retrieval capabilities**: Query relevant memories based on current context\n\n### 3. **Memory Injection Patterns**\n- **Pre-processing**: Inject relevant memories before agent execution\n- **Dynamic retrieval**: Fetch memories during graph execution based on current state\n- **Post-processing**: Update memories after interactions\n\n## RAG Context Injection in LangGraph\n\n### 1. **Agentic RAG Architecture**\nLangGraph enables building **adaptive RAG systems** where agents decide when and how to retrieve:\n\n**Core Components:**\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\n    messages: List[BaseMessage]\n    documents: List[Document]\n    next_action: str\n\n# Retrieval node\ndef retrieve(state: AgentState):\n    query = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n    docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n    return {\"documents\": docs}\n\n# Grade documents node\ndef grade_documents(state: AgentState):\n    # Filter relevant docs\n    filtered = [d for d in state[\"documents\"] if is_relevant(d)]\n    return {\"documents\": filtered}\n\n# Generate node with context\ndef generate(state: AgentState):\n    context = \"\\n\".join([d.page_content for d in state[\"documents\"]])\n    response = llm.invoke(f\"Context: {context}\\n\\nQuestion: {state['messages'][-1]}\")\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\n# Build graph\ngraph = StateGraph(AgentState)\ngraph.add_node(\"retrieve\", retrieve)\ngraph.add_node(\"grade\", grade_documents)\ngraph.add_node(\"generate\", generate)\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"grade\", decide_to_generate_or_rewrite)\n```\n\n### 2. **Context Injection Strategies**\n\n**Option 1: Direct State Injection**\n```python\ndef inject_context(state: AgentState):\n    # Retrieve from vector store\n    relevant_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(state[\"query\"])\n    \n    # Inject into state\n    return {\n        \"context\": relevant_docs,\n        \"messages\": state[\"messages\"]\n    }\n```\n\n**Option 2: Tool-Based Retrieval**\n```python\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\n\n@tool\ndef search_knowledge_base(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Search the knowledge base for relevant information.\"\"\"\n    docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n    return \"\\n\".join([d.page_content for d in docs])\n\n# Agent can call this tool as needed\n```\n\n**Option 3: Conditional Retrieval Flow**\n```python\ndef should_retrieve(state: AgentState) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Decide if retrieval is needed based on query complexity.\"\"\"\n    if requires_external_knowledge(state[\"messages\"][-1]):\n        return \"retrieve\"\n    return \"generate\"\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"router\", should_retrieve)\n```\n\n### 3. **Best Practices for 2026**\n\n**Memory Management:**\n- Use **Store** for cross-conversation facts\n- Use **Checkpointers** for conversation state\n- Implement memory cleanup strategies for long-running agents\n- Consider semantic search over stored memories\n\n**RAG Integration:**\n- Implement **self-corrective RAG** with document grading\n- Use **adaptive retrieval** - only retrieve when needed\n- Add **hallucination detection** and document verification\n- Support **multi-hop reasoning** with iterative retrieval\n- Implement **query rewriting** for better retrieval results\n\n**Performance:**\n- Cache frequently accessed documents\n- Use async operations for parallel retrieval\n- Implement timeout and error handling\n- Monitor token usage with context injection\n\n## Complete Example Pattern\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\nfrom langgraph.store import InMemoryStore\n\n# Initialize persistence\ncheckpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"postgresql://...\")\nstore = InMemoryStore()\n\n# Build graph with both memory types\napp = graph.compile(\n    checkpointer=checkpointer,  # For conversation state\n    store=store                  # For cross-conversation memory\n)\n\n# Use with context\nconfig = {\n    \"configurable\": {\n        \"thread_id\": \"conversation_123\",\n        \"user_id\": \"user_456\"  # For store namespace\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Memory - Docs by LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory)\n- [Build a custom RAG agent with

execution based on current state\n- **Post-processing**: Update memories after interactions\n\n## RAG Context Injection in LangGraph\n\n### 1. **Agentic RAG Architecture**\nLangGraph enables building **adaptive RAG systems** where agents decide when and how to retrieve:\n\n**Core Components:**\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\n    messages: List[BaseMessage]\n    documents: List[Document]\n    next_action: str\n\n# Retrieval node\ndef retrieve(state: AgentState):\n    query = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n    docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n    return {\"documents\": docs}\n\n# Grade documents node\ndef grade_documents(state: AgentState):\n    # Filter relevant docs\n    filtered = [d for d in state[\"documents\"] if is_relevant(d)]\n    return {\"documents\": filtered}\n\n# Generate node with context\ndef generate(state: AgentState):\n    context = \"\\n\".join([d.page_content for d in state[\"documents\"]])\n    response = llm.invoke(f\"Context: {context}\\n\\nQuestion: {state['messages'][-1]}\")\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\n# Build graph\ngraph = StateGraph(AgentState)\ngraph.add_node(\"retrieve\", retrieve)\ngraph.add_node(\"grade\", grade_documents)\ngraph.add_node(\"generate\", generate)\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"grade\", decide_to_generate_or_rewrite)\n```\n\n### 2. **Context Injection Strategies**\n\n**Option 1: Direct State Injection**\n```python\ndef inject_context(state: AgentState):\n    # Retrieve from vector store\n    relevant_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(state[\"query\"])\n    \n    # Inject into state\n    return {\n        \"context\": relevant_docs,\n        \"messages\": state[\"messages\"]\n    }\n```\n\n**Option 2: Tool-Based Retrieval**\n```python\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\n\n@tool\ndef search_knowledge_base(query: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Search the knowledge base for relevant information.\"\"\"\n    docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)\n    return \"\\n\".join([d.page_content for d in docs])\n\n# Agent can call this tool as needed\n```\n\n**Option 3: Conditional Retrieval Flow**\n```python\ndef should_retrieve(state: AgentState) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Decide if retrieval is needed based on query complexity.\"\"\"\n    if requires_external_knowledge(state[\"messages\"][-1]):\n        return \"retrieve\"\n    return \"generate\"\n\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"router\", should_retrieve)\n```\n\n### 3. **Best Practices for 2026**\n\n**Memory Management:**\n- Use **Store** for cross-conversation facts\n- Use **Checkpointers** for conversation state\n- Implement memory cleanup strategies for long-running agents\n- Consider semantic search over stored memories\n\n**RAG Integration:**\n- Implement **self-corrective RAG** with document grading\n- Use **adaptive retrieval** - only retrieve when needed\n- Add **hallucination detection** and document verification\n- Support **multi-hop reasoning** with iterative retrieval\n- Implement **query rewriting** for better retrieval results\n\n**Performance:**\n- Cache frequently accessed documents\n- Use async operations for parallel retrieval\n- Implement timeout and error handling\n- Monitor token usage with context injection\n\n## Complete Example Pattern\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\nfrom langgraph.store import InMemoryStore\n\n# Initialize persistence\ncheckpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"postgresql://...\")\nstore = InMemoryStore()\n\n# Build graph with both memory types\napp = graph.compile(\n    checkpointer=checkpointer,  # For conversation state\n    store=store                  # For cross-conversation memory\n)\n\n# Use with context\nconfig = {\n    \"configurable\": {\n        \"thread_id\": \"conversation_123\",\n        \"user_id\": \"user_456\"  # For store namespace\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Memory - Docs by LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory)\n- [Build a custom RAG agent with

{"id":"websearch-212","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?","output":"Based on the latest information from 2024-2025, here's how to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDocker manipulates **iptables** directly, bypassing UFW rules entirely. When you publish a container port (e.g., `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx`), Docker adds its own ACCEPT rules that execute **before** UFW rules in the packet processing chain. This means even if you run `ufw deny 8080`, the port remains publicly accessible.\n\n## The Solution: Modify UFW Configuration\n\nThis solution modifies UFW to integrate with Docker's **DOCKER-USER** chain, which Docker guarantees will be evaluated before its own rules.\n\n### Step 1: Edit UFW After Rules\n\nAdd the following rules to `/etc/ufw/after.rules` at the end of the file (before the final `COMMIT`):\n\n```bash\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [0:0]\n:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [0:0]\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 172.16.0.0/12\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] \"\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\n**What this does:**\n- Routes Docker traffic through UFW's chains\n- Allows internal private network traffic (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)\n- Blocks external traffic to private container IPs\n- Allows DNS responses\n- Logs and drops unauthorized traffic\n\n### Step 2: Restart UFW\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n# or\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\n⚠️ **Note:** If rules don't take effect, reboot the server.\n\n## Allowing Public Access to Containers\n\nAfter applying these rules, **all published Docker ports are blocked from external access by default**. To selectively expose services:\n\n### Allow any container on a specific port:\n```bash\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to any port 80\n```\n\n### Allow a specific container by IP:\n```bash\n# Find container IP: docker inspect <container> | grep IPAddress\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to 172.17.0.2 port 80\n```\n\n### Allow UDP services (e.g., DNS):\n```bash\nufw route allow proto udp from any to any port 53\n```\n\n## Alternative Solution: Bind to Localhost\n\nInstead of exposing container ports directly, bind them to **127.0.0.1** and use a host-level reverse proxy:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  blog:\n    image: myapp\n    ports:\n      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80  # Only accessible locally\n```\n\nThen configure nginx on the host to proxy traffic:\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name example.com;\n    \n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures containers are never directly exposed to the internet.\n\n## Why This Works\n\nDocker's **DOCKER-USER** chain is evaluated **before** Docker's own routing decisions.

This is particularly useful for users who import Pixel phones into countries where Google doesn't directly sell them.\n\n### How It Works\nThe app uses **Shizuku** (an elevated permission framework) to apply carrier configurations without requiring root access. When Shizuku starts, the app automatically:\n1. Enables VoLTE, supplementary services (UT), and video calling\n2. Enables standby/alternate calling\n3. Enables VoWiFi, VoWiFi roaming, and Wi-Fi-only support\n4. Enables enhanced 4G (LTE+)\n5. Enables 5G (NSA and SA) and Vo5G\n\n### The Google vs. vvb2060 Battle\n\n**October 2025**: Google patched the original Pixel IMS app loophole by blocking the shell user from calling the `overrideConfig` API, which the app used to override carrier configurations.\n\n**The Workaround**: The developer quickly implemented a fix that bypasses the restriction by \"laundering\" the API call through an `Instrumentation` component, making it appear the call doesn't originate from the shell user.\n\n**Current Status**: As of 2026, the method still works, but Google could potentially patch it again by removing the `MODIFY_PHONE_STATE` permission from the shell app entirely.\n\n### Installation Steps\n1. Download the IMS app from the [vvb2060/Ims GitHub releases](https://github.com/vvb2060/Ims/releases)\n2. Install and set up Shizuku\n3. Authorize the app (io.github.vvb2060.ims) in Shizuku\n4. Restart Shizuku\n5. Enable VoLTE and VoWiFi in SIM card settings\n\nThe app is \"install and forget\" - it automatically applies configurations on every device boot since Shizuku supports auto-start.\n\n### Important Notes\n- **No root required** - uses Shizuku for elevated permissions\n- Google classified the loophole as a **high-severity privilege escalation vulnerability** (CVE-2025-48617)\n- The ongoing cat-and-mouse game between Google and developers may continue\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [GitHub - vvb2060/Ims](https://github.com/vvb2060/Ims)\n- [Google tried to kill this Pixel VoLTE-enabling app - Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-update-fix-3606811/)\n- [Google Patches Pixel IMS App | Here's a New Method to Enable VoLTE - DroidWin](https://droidwin.com/google-patches-pixel-ims-app-heres-a-new-method-to-enable-volte/)","hint":"A good answer should explain that the vvb2060 IMS app (io.github.vvb2060.ims) is an ADB/Shizuku-based tool that enables or configures IMS features like VoLTE/VoWiFi (and sometimes VoNR/5G) on Google Pixel or other Android devices, especially in unsupported regions or after Google’s patches, and should mention its GitHub origin/maintenance status and 2025–2026 compatibility issues/limitations with newer Android or Pixel updates.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about the vvb2060 IMS Android app for IMS VoLTE.","timestamp":32171},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":32171},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01ADwX98m9UncRF4QLXfejqQ","status":"completed","timestamp":32171},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information about the vvb2060 IMS app from GitHub and some of these articles.","timestamp":32171},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":32171},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NXgsnqC5Rg7G52DJFv2vyx","status":"completed","timestamp":32171},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's what you need to know about the **vvb2060 IMS Android app** for IMS VoLTE in 2026:\n\n## Key Information\n\n### Repository Status\n- **The vvb2060/Ims repository was archived on December 18, 2025** and is now read-only\n- Latest release: **v3.0** (December 18, 2025)\n- The app has 316 stars and 38 forks on GitHub\n\n### What the App Does\nThe vvb2060 IMS app is designed to enable **VoLTE (Voice over LTE)** and **VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi)** on Google Pixel devices in regions where these features are not officially supported by Google.

managed cryptographic classes (SHA256Managed, etc.) now redirect to system libraries instead of throwing exceptions in FIPS mode\n- **Updated ZLib**: Updated to version 1.2.11 with key improvements and fixes\n\n### **Windows Forms**\n- **Accessibility Features**: \n  - ToolTips on keyboard access (Tab/arrow keys)\n  - UIA LiveRegions support for Labels and StatusStrips\n  - UIA Notification Events for dynamic content announcements\n  - High-contrast improvements\n\n### **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)**\n- **High DPI Support**: Per-Monitor V2 DPI Awareness and Mixed-Mode DPI scaling\n- **SelectionTextBrush Property**: Custom brush selection for non-adorner based text selection\n- **Improved Accessibility**: \n  - Screen readers no longer announce Collapsed/Hidden elements\n  - ToolTips on keyboard focus\n  - SizeOfSet and PositionInSet UIAutomation properties\n  - ControllerFor property support\n- **Performance**: Fixed memory leaks in UIAutomation\n\n### **Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)**\n- **ServiceHealthBehavior**: New health endpoints for monitoring service health status with HTTP response codes\n\n### **ASP.NET**\n- **Secure Hash Options**: Support for SHA-2 (in 4.7.1+, carried forward to 4.8)\n- **Dependency Injection**: Enhanced support for DI frameworks (4.7.2+)\n\n### **.NET Standard**\n- Improved support for .NET Standard 2.0\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\n.NET Framework 4.8 is the **final major version** of the .NET Framework. It represents significant improvements over 4.5.2 in:\n- Security and malware protection\n- Performance (JIT, GC)\n- Accessibility across all UI frameworks\n- High-DPI display support\n- Developer productivity (cryptography, configuration)\n\nAs of 2025, Microsoft continues to provide security updates for .NET Framework 4.8, but new development is focused on the cross-platform .NET (formerly .NET Core), with .NET 8 being the current LTS version.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Announcing the .NET Framework 4.8 - .NET Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-net-framework-4-8/)\n- [What's new in Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 | InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2258051/whats-new-in-microsoft-net-framework.html)\n- [Difference between .NET 4 and .NET 4.8 - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73151225/difference-between-net-4-and-net-4-8)","timestamp":67751}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"DotNET","lang":"CSharp","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770545311245,"end":1770545378995,"firstResponse":67751,"sessionCreation":0,"total":67750},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-304","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix the lifi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error in solidity 2026","output":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about fixing the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` custom error in LiFi facets:\n\n## How to Fix the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` Custom Error in LiFi Solidity Contracts\n\nThe `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error is a validation check in LiFi's bridge facets that prevents users from attempting to bridge tokens to the same blockchain network they're already on. This error occurs when the source chain ID equals the destination chain ID.\n\n### Understanding the Error\n\nThis is a **custom error** in Solidity (introduced in Solidity 0.8.4+) that provides:\n- Better gas efficiency compared to string revert messages\n- Clear error identification in transactions\n- Type-safe error handling\n\n### Common Causes\n\n1. **User Input Error**: The user selected the same chain for both source and destination\n2. **Frontend Integration Issue**: The UI didn't properly validate chain IDs before submitting\n3. **API Response Issue**: The route returned by LiFi API has matching chain IDs\n4. **Testing/Development**: Incorrect parameters during testing\n\n### Solutions\n\n#### 1. **Frontend Validation (Recommended)**\n\nValidate before sending the transaction:\n\n```typescript\n// In your frontend code\nif (sourceChainId === destinationChainId) {\n  throw new Error('Cannot bridge to the same network. Please select a different destination chain.');\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. **Smart Contract Side**\n\nIf you're integrating LiFi facets into your own contract, add validation:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.17;\n\nerror CannotBridgeToSameNetwork();\n\ncontract YourBridgeIntegration {\n    function bridgeTokens(\n        uint256 sourceChainId,\n        uint256 destinationChainId,\n        address token,\n        uint256 amount\n    ) external {\n        // Validate chain IDs\n        if (sourceChainId == destinationChainId) {\n            revert CannotBridgeToSameNetwork();\n        }\n        \n        // Or check against current chain\n        if (block.chainid == destinationChainId) {\n            revert CannotBridgeToSameNetwork();\n        }\n        \n        // Continue with bridge logic...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. **Using LiFi API Properly**\n\nWhen requesting routes from the LiFi API, ensure proper parameters:\n\n```typescript\nimport { LIFI } from '@lifi/sdk';\n\nconst lifi = new LIFI();\n\nconst quote = await lifi.getQuote({\n  fromChain: 1, // Ethereum\n  toChain: 137, // Polygon - MUST be different!\n  fromToken: '0x...', \n  toToken: '0x...',\n  fromAmount: '1000000',\n  fromAddress: userAddress,\n});\n\n// Validate before executing\nif (quote.action.fromChainId === quote.action.toChainId) {\n  throw new Error('Invalid route: same network');\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Error Handling in dApp**\n\nCatch and handle the error gracefully:\n\n```typescript\ntry {\n  await contract.bridgeTokens(/* params */);\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error.message.includes('CannotBridgeToSameNetwork')) {\n    // Show user-friendly message\n    showError('You cannot bridge to the same network. Please select a different destination chain.');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. **Testing Fix**\n\nAdd proper test cases:\n\n```solidity\n// In your test file\nfunction testCannotBridgeToSameNetwork() public {\n    uint256 chainId = block.chainid;\n    \n    vm.expectRevert(CannotBridgeToSameNetwork.selector);\n    bridgeContract.bridgeTokens(\n        chainId,  // source\n        chainId,  // destination - same as source\n        tokenAddress,\n        amount\n    );\n}\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Validate Early**: Check chain IDs in your frontend before making contract calls\n2. **Clear Error Messages**: Provide user-friendly error messages in your UI\n3. **Use LiFi SDK**: The official SDK handles many validations automatically\n4. **Check API Responses**: Always validate the routes returned by the LiFi API\n5. **Same-Chain Swaps**: If users want to swap on the same chain, use DEX aggregators instead of bridges\n\n### For Same-Chain Swaps\n\nIf the user wants to swap tokens on the same chain:\n\n```typescript\n// Use a DEX instead of bridge\nconst quote = await lifi.getQuote({\n  fromChain: 1,\n  toChain: 1, // Same chain is OK for swaps\n  fromToken: '0x...', \n  toToken: '0x...',\n  fromAmount: '1000000',\n  // This will route through DEXs, not bridges\n});\n```\n\nThe LiFi protocol will automatically route same-chain requests through DEX aggregators (like 1inch, Paraswap) instead of bridge contracts.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Error Codes - LI.FI](https://docs.li.fi/api-reference/error-codes)\n- [GitHub - lifinance/contracts: LI.FI Smart Contracts](https://github.com/lifinance/contracts)\n- [Custom Errors in Solidity | Solidity Programming Language](https://www.soliditylang.org/blog/2021/04/21/custom-errors/)\n- [Error Handling in Solidity: require, revert, assert, and Custom Errors](https://medium.com/@nareshmmr/error-handling-in-solidity-require-revert-assert-and-custom-errors-eb823c0fe2b6)","hint":"A good answer must recognize that `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` is a Solidity custom error in LiFi’s bridge facets that triggers when the source and destination chains/networks are the same (e.g., identical chain IDs), and explain that the fix is to ensure different source/destination network parameters (or correct misconfigured chain IDs) before invoking the bridge, possibly mentioning updating or checking the contract/config that validates these values.[[1]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about fixing the LiFi facets `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` custom error in Solidity.","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45467},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_016GCSpWVF5B9d3fzm14649z","status":"completed","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45467},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011TCHcmfTHJid57Nz6deBxo","status":"completed","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information from the LiFi contracts repository and error codes documentation:","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45467},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_013tc4Rrzss7KZjC1Hd6GC95","status":"completed","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for the specific error in the LiFi contracts source code:","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45467},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017Hweir1dgjK3ciYhzDn4Gv","status":"completed","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search more specifically for this error and how to handle it:","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45467},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019SYXi81R76s35qGiBHaLbd","status":"completed","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45467},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LAihiBrW9owJ5Jg5Af1dhH","status":"completed","timestamp":45467},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about fixing the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` custom error in LiFi facets:\n\n## How to Fix the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` Custom Error in LiFi Solidity Contracts\n\nThe `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error is a validation check in LiFi's bridge facets that prevents users from attempting to bridge tokens to the same blockchain network they're already on.

Now I have all the information needed. Let me provide a comprehensive answer about these technical analysis formulas.\n\n## Average True Range (ATR) Formula\n\nThe **True Range (TR)** is calculated as the maximum of three values:\n\n**TR = Max[(H - L), |H - Cp|, |L - Cp|]**\n\nWhere:\n- **H** = Today's high\n- **L** = Today's low  \n- **Cp** = Yesterday's closing price (previous close)\n\nThe three terms are:\n1. **(H - L)** = Today's high minus today's low\n2. **|H - Cp|** = Absolute value of today's high minus yesterday's close\n3. **|L - Cp|** = Absolute value of today's low minus yesterday's close\n\nThe **Average True Range (ATR)** is then calculated as:\n\n**ATR = (Previous ATR(n-1) + TR) / n**\n\nWhere n = Number of periods (typically 14 days)\n\nFor the initial ATR calculation (when no previous ATR exists):\n\n**ATR = (1/n) × Σ TRi** (sum of all true ranges divided by the number of periods)\n\n## VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) Formula\n\n**VWAP = (Cumulative Typical Price × Volume) / Cumulative Volume**\n\nWhere:\n- **Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3**\n- **Cumulative** = Total since the trading session opened\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n1.

control approach for geo-distributed transaction processing on permissioned blockchains\"** (Nature Scientific Reports, 2025)\n   - Focus on deterministic concurrency control for distributed systems\n   - Addresses geo-distributed transaction processing challenges\n\n2. **\"Distributed Locking: Performance Analysis and Optimization Strategies\"** (arXiv, April 2025)\n   - Analyzes performance of distributed locking mechanisms\n   - Proposes optimization strategies for lock management\n\n3. **\"Fairly Decentralizing a Hybrid Concurrency Control Protocol\"** (Wiley, February 2025)\n   - Focuses on hybrid concurrency control protocols\n   - Addresses fairness in decentralized systems\n\n4. **\"Intelligent Transaction Scheduling to Enhance Concurrency\"** (MDPI Applied Sciences, June 2025)\n   - Research on intelligent scheduling algorithms\n   - Aims to enhance database concurrency\n\n### IEEE Research (2023, still relevant):\n\n**\"Making Lock Manager Concurrent for Deterministic Database\"** (IEEE IPDPSW 2023)\n- Proposes novel lock manager for deterministic concurrency control\n- Eliminates bottlenecks in naive locking mechanisms\n- Showed up to **184x performance improvement** over conventional methods\n- Outperformed SS2PL under high-contention workloads\n\n### Industry/Practical Developments (2025):\n\nSeveral 2025 articles discuss **PostgreSQL advisory locks** for distributed systems:\n- Orchestrating distributed tasks with advisory locks\n- Performance challenges and benefits in high-concurrency scenarios\n- Practical implementation patterns\n\n**Note:** True \"advisory locks\" (application-level cooperative locking) are more commonly discussed in database-specific contexts (PostgreSQL, MySQL) rather than formal IEEE research papers, which tend to focus on theoretical concurrency control protocols and mechanisms.\n\n## Sources:\n- [An optimized deterministic concurrency control

on my search results, here's what I found about the latest 2025 research on advisory lock database concurrency control:\n\n## Latest 2025 Research Findings\n\nWhile I found limited **IEEE-specific** publications from 2025 on advisory locks specifically, I discovered several important research developments in related database concurrency control areas:\n\n### Key 2025 Publications:\n\n1. **\"An optimized deterministic concurrency control approach for geo-distributed transaction processing on permissioned blockchains\"** (Nature Scientific Reports, 2025)\n   - Focus on deterministic concurrency control for distributed systems\n   - Addresses geo-distributed transaction processing challenges\n\n2. **\"Distributed Locking: Performance Analysis and Optimization Strategies\"** (arXiv, April 2025)\n   - Analyzes performance of distributed locking mechanisms\n   - Proposes optimization strategies for lock management\n\n3. **\"Fairly Decentralizing a Hybrid Concurrency Control Protocol\"** (Wiley, February 2025)\n   - Focuses on hybrid concurrency control protocols\n   - Addresses fairness in decentralized systems\n\n4. **\"Intelligent Transaction Scheduling to Enhance Concurrency\"** (MDPI Applied Sciences, June 2025)\n   - Research on intelligent scheduling algorithms\n   - Aims to enhance database concurrency\n\n### IEEE Research (2023, still relevant):\n\n**\"Making Lock Manager Concurrent for Deterministic Database\"** (IEEE IPDPSW 2023)\n- Proposes novel lock manager for deterministic concurrency control\n- Eliminates bottlenecks in naive locking mechanisms\n- Showed up to **184x performance improvement** over conventional methods\n- Outperformed SS2PL under high-contention workloads\n\n### Industry/Practical Developments (2025):\n\nSeveral 2025 articles discuss **PostgreSQL advisory locks** for distributed systems:\n- Orchestrating distributed tasks with advisory locks\n- Performance challenges and benefits in high-concurrency scenarios\n- Practical implementation patterns\n\n**Note:** True \"advisory locks\" (application-level cooperative locking) are more commonly discussed in database-specific contexts (PostgreSQL, MySQL) rather than formal IEEE research papers, which tend to focus on theoretical concurrency control protocols and mechanisms.\n\n## Sources:\n- [An optimized deterministic concurrency

AS $$\nBEGIN\n  -- Check if the parameter was provided\n  IF pricing_overrides IS NOT NULL THEN\n    -- Apply the overrides\n  ELSE\n    -- Use default pricing logic\n  END IF;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n### 2. **Handle NULL vs Empty Array Explicitly**\n\nBe clear about the semantic difference:\n- **NULL**: No overrides provided (use default behavior)\n- **Empty array `'{}'`**: Explicitly clear all overrides\n\n```sql\nIF pricing_overrides IS NULL THEN\n  -- No overrides specified, use defaults\nELSIF array_length(pricing_overrides, 1) IS NULL THEN\n  -- Empty array provided, clear overrides\nELSE\n  -- Process the overrides\nEND IF;\n```\n\n### 3. **Use JSONB for Complex Pricing Override Structures**\n\nFor pricing overrides, JSONB is often better than primitive arrays because it allows structured data:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n  product_id INT,\n  pricing_overrides JSONB DEFAULT NULL  -- Better for complex structures\n)\nRETURNS TABLE(...) AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF pricing_overrides IS NOT NULL THEN\n    -- pricing_overrides could be: \n    -- [{\"item_id\": 1, \"price\": 99.99}, {\"item_id\": 2, \"discount\": 0.15}]\n  END IF;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n### 4. **Client-Side: Pass Undefined or Omit for NULL**\n\nWhen calling from JavaScript/TypeScript with Supabase:\n\n```typescript\n// For NULL (use default pricing)\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  product_id: 123\n  // Don't pass pricing_overrides at all, or pass undefined\n});\n\n// For empty array (explicitly clear overrides)\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  product_id: 123,\n  pricing_overrides: []\n});\n\n// With actual overrides\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  product_id: 123,\n  pricing_overrides: [\n    { item_id: 1, price: 99.99 },\n    { item_id: 2, discount: 0.15 }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n### 5. **Use COALESCE for Simple Default Values**\n\nFor simpler cases, you can provide a default empty array or default value inline:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n  product_id INT,\n  pricing_overrides JSONB[] DEFAULT '{}'  -- Default to empty array\n)\nRETURNS TABLE(...)

Getting them \"double-indexed\" as part of your website isn't necessary for 99.99% of sites unless you have a specific business reason.\n\n### 2. **\"Could Not Determine Prominent Video\"**\n\nThis happens when:\n- Multiple videos have equal prominence on one page\n- The video is too small (under 1/3 viewport size or below 140px)\n- The video is positioned below the fold\n- The video is too tall (over 1080px for horizontal, 1920px for vertical)\n- The video is in a sidebar instead of main content area\n\n**How to fix:**\n- Limit pages to one video at a time\n- Ensure video is above the fold and properly sized\n- Place video in the main content area, not sidebar\n- Size video appropriately (minimum 140px, at least 1/3 of viewport)\n\n### 3. **Other Common Issues**\n\n**Thumbnail Problems:**\n- Missing thumbnail URL in schema markup\n- Invalid format (use BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG, or AVIF)\n- Too small (minimum 60x30px; larger preferred)\n- Too much transparency (at least 80% should have alpha value over 250)\n- Thumbnail blocked by robots.txt\n\n**Technical Issues:**\n- Missing or invalid video structured data\n- No video sitemap submitted\n- Website not following Google's video publishing guidelines\n- Content quality issues\n\n## Best Practices for 2024\n\n1. **Follow Google's Video SEO Guidelines** at developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video\n2. **Create and submit a Video Sitemap** to Google Search Console\n3. **Use proper Video Structured Data** (VideoObject schema)\n4. **Ensure high-quality, original content** on the page\n5. **Make the video the main focus** if you want it indexed on your site\n\n**Pro Tip:** Since all public YouTube videos are already indexed by Google (searchable via YouTube), focus your efforts on creating quality content rather than trying to get embedded YouTube videos indexed separately on your blog.

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"Based on the official Clerk documentation, here's how to handle Clerk webhook events for organization operations in 2026:\n\n## Overview\n\nClerk webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when organization events occur. The three main organization events are:\n\n- **`organization.created`** - Triggered when a new organization is created\n- **`organization.updated`** - Triggered when organization information is updated  \n- **`organization.deleted`** - Triggered when an organization is deleted\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to the [Webhooks page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/webhooks) in Clerk Dashboard\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-app.com/api/webhooks`)\n4. Subscribe to the organization events: `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, `organization.deleted`\n5. Copy the **Signing Secret** for verification\n\n### 2. Add Signing Secret to Environment Variables\n\nAdd to your `.env` file:\n\n```env\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx\n```\n\n### 3. Implement the Webhook Handler\n\nHere's a complete example for handling organization webhook events:\n\n**For Next.js (App Router):**\n\n```typescript\n// app/api/webhooks/route.ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\nimport { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport type { OrganizationJSON, DeletedObjectJSON } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n\n    // Handle organization.created event\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.created') {\n      const orgData = evt.data as OrganizationJSON\n      console.log('Organization created:', orgData.id)\n      // Sync to your database\n      // await db.organization.create({\n      //   id: orgData.id,\n      //   name: orgData.name,\n      //   slug: orgData.slug,\n      //   createdAt: new Date(orgData.created_at)\n      // })\n    }\n\n    // Handle organization.updated event\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.updated') {\n      const orgData = evt.data as OrganizationJSON\n      console.log('Organization updated:', orgData.id)\n      // Update in your database\n      // await db.organization.update({\n      //   where: { id: orgData.id },\n      //   data: {\n      //     name: orgData.name,\n      //     slug: orgData.slug,\n      //     updatedAt: new Date(orgData.updated_at)\n      //   }\n      // })\n    }\n\n    // Handle organization.deleted event\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.deleted') {\n      const deleteData = evt.data as DeletedObjectJSON\n      console.log('Organization deleted:', deleteData.id)\n      // Delete from your database or mark as deleted\n      // await db.organization.delete({\n      //   where: { id: deleteData.id }\n      // })\n      // OR mark as deleted:\n      // await db.organization.update({\n      //   where: { id: deleteData.id },\n      //   data: { deleted: true }\n      // })\n    }\n\n    return new Response('Webhook processed', { status: 200 })\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err)\n    return new Response('Error verifying webhook', { status: 400 })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For Express:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/express/webhooks'\nimport express from 'express'\n\nconst app = express()\n\napp.post('/api/webhooks', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.created') {\n      const orgData = evt.data\n      console.log('Organization created:', orgData.id)\n      // Handle creation\n    }\n\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.updated') {\n      const orgData = evt.data\n      console.log('Organization updated:', orgData.id)\n      // Handle update\n    }\n\n    if (evt.type === 'organization.deleted') {\n      const deleteData = evt.data\n      console.log('Organization deleted:', deleteData.id)\n      // Handle deletion\n    }\n\n    return res.send('Webhook received')\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err)\n    return res.status(400).send('Error verifying webhook')\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Payload Structure\n\nThe webhook payload includes:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    // OrganizationJSON for created/updated\n    // DeletedObjectJSON for deleted\n  },\n  \"object\": \"event\",\n  \"type\": \"organization.created\", // or .updated or .deleted\n  \"timestamp\": 1654012591835,\n  \"instance_id\": \"ins_123\"\n}\n```\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n1. **Webhook Security**: Always verify webhook signatures using `verifyWebhook()` to prevent abuse\n2. **Asynchronous Nature**: Webhooks are eventually consistent -

The three main organization events are:\n\n- **`organization.created`** - Triggered when a new organization is created\n- **`organization.updated`** - Triggered when organization information is updated  \n- **`organization.deleted`** - Triggered when an organization is deleted\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to the [Webhooks page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/webhooks) in Clerk Dashboard\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-app.com/api/webhooks`)\n4. Subscribe to the organization events: `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, `organization.deleted`\n5. Copy the **Signing Secret** for verification\n\n### 2. Add Signing Secret to Environment Variables\n\nAdd to your `.env` file:\n\n```env\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx\n```\n\n### 3.

The two main options are:\n\n1. **i18n4k** - A comprehensive KMP i18n library with built-in code generation\n2. **MokoResources** - A resource management library that can be extended with custom KSP processors\n\n## Approach 1: Using i18n4k (Recommended)\n\n### Setup\n\nAdd to your `libs.versions.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[plugins]\nksp = { id = \"com.google.devtools.ksp\", version = \"2.1.0-1.0.29\" }\ni18n4k = { id = \"de.comahe.i18n4k\", version = \"0.11.1\" }\n```\n\nAdd to your module's `build.gradle.kts`:\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\")\n    id(\"de.comahe.i18n4k\")\n}\n\nkotlin {\n    jvm()\n    iosArm64()\n    iosX64()\n    iosSimulatorArm64()\n    \n    sourceSets {\n        commonMain.dependencies {\n            implementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core:0.11.1\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Configure i18n4k\ni18n4k {\n    sourceCodeLocales = listOf(\"en\", \"de\")\n    inputDirectory = \"src/commonMain/i18n\"\n}\n```\n\n### Create Message Bundles\n\nCreate property files in `src/commonMain/i18n/`:\n\n**MyMessages_en.properties**:\n```properties\nsayHello=Hello, {0}!\ntitle=Internationalization example\nerrorMessage=An error occurred: {error}\n```\n\n**MyMessages_de.properties**:\n```properties\nsayHello=Hallo, {0}!\ntitle=Internationalisierung Beispiel\nerrorMessage=Ein Fehler ist aufgetreten: {error}\n```\n\n### Generated Code\n\ni18n4k automatically generates type-safe accessors:\n\n```kotlin\nobject MyMessages : MessageBundle(\"MyMessages\", \"com.example\") {\n    val sayHello: LocalizedStringFactory1 = \n        getLocalizedStringFactory1(\"sayHello\", 0)\n    \n    val title: LocalizedString = \n        getLocalizedString0(\"title\", 1)\n    \n    val errorMessage: LocalizedStringFactory1 = \n        getLocalizedStringFactory1(\"errorMessage\", 2)\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```kotlin\n// Simple string\nprintln(MyMessages.title.toString())\n\n// String with parameters\nprintln(MyMessages.sayHello(\"World\"))\n\n// Change locale\nval config = I18n4kConfigDefault()\ni18n4k = config\nconfig.locale = Locale(\"de\")\n```\n\n## Approach 2: Custom KSP Processor with MokoResources\n\nFor more control, you can create a custom KSP processor:\n\n### Setup\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\")\n    id(\"dev.icerock.mobile.multiplatform-resources\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", project(\":i18n-generator\"))\n    add(\"kspJvm\", project(\":i18n-generator\"))\n    add(\"kspIosArm64\", project(\":i18n-generator\"))\n}\n```\n\n### Custom KSP Processor\n\nCreate a processor that generates type-safe resource keys:\n\n```kotlin\nclass I18nProcessor(\n    private val codeGenerator: CodeGenerator,\n    private val logger: KSPLogger\n) : SymbolProcessor {\n    \n    override fun process(resolver: Resolver): List<KSAnnotated> {\n        // Find resource files\n        val resourceFiles = findI18nResources()\n        \n        // Generate sealed classes for string keys\n        generateStringKeys(resourceFiles)\n        \n        return emptyList()\n    }\n    \n    private fun generateStringKeys(resources: Map<String, List<String>>) {\n        val fileSpec = FileSpec.builder(\"com.example.i18n\", \"StringKeys\")\n            .addType(\n                TypeSpec.classBuilder(\"StringResourceKey\")\n                    .modifiers(KModifier.SEALED)\n                    .apply {\n                        resources.forEach { (key, _) ->\n                            addType(\n                                TypeSpec.objectBuilder(key.capitalize())\n                                    .superclass(ClassName(\"\", \"StringResourceKey\"))\n                                    .build()\n                            )\n                        }\n                    }\n                    .build()\n            )\n            .build()\n        \n        val file = codeGenerator.createNewFile(\n            Dependencies(false),\n            \"com.example.i18n\",\n            \"StringKeys\"\n        )\n        file.write(fileSpec.toString().toByteArray())\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Localizer Interface\n\nCreate a platform-agnostic interface:\n\n```kotlin\ninterface Localizer {\n    fun getString(key: StringResourceKey): String\n    fun getString(key: StringResourceKey, vararg args: Any): String\n    fun getPlural(key: PluralsResourceKey, quantity: Int): String\n}\n```\n\n### Platform Implementations\n\n**Android**:\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocalizer(\n    private val context: Context\n) {\n    actual fun localized(stringDesc: StringDesc): String {\n        return stringDesc.toString(context)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**iOS**:\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocalizer {\n    actual fun localized(stringDesc: StringDesc): String {\n        return stringDesc.localized()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## KSP Configuration for Multiplatform\n\n### Per-Target Configuration (KSP 1.0.1+)\n\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    // Common code\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    \n    // Per-target\n    add(\"kspJvm\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosArm64\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosX64\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosSimulatorArm64\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    \n    // Test targets (optional)\n    add(\"kspJvmTest\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n}\n```\n\n### Avoid Old ksp() Configuration\n\nThe old `ksp()` configuration applies to all targets and is being deprecated. Use target-specific configurations for better performance.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Module Structure**: Separate concerns into three modules:\n   - `:i18n:generator` - KSP processor\n   - `:i18n:api` - Localizer interface\n   - `:i18n:implementation` - Platform implementations\n\n2. **Type Safety**: Use sealed classes for resource keys to prevent runtime errors\n\n3. **Testing**: Create platform-specific tests for localization:\n\n```kotlin\nabstract class LocalizerTest {\n    abstract val localizer: Localizer\n    \n    @Test\n    fun testLocalization() {\n        assertEquals(\"Hello\", localizer.getString(StringResourceKey.Greeting))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. **Compose Integration**: For Compose Multiplatform, configure output directory:\n\n```kotlin\ni18n4k {\n    languageFilesOutputDirectory = \n        \"{projectDir}/src/commonMain/composeResources/files/i18n\"\n}\n```\n\n## Key Advantages\n\n- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checks for resource keys\n- **Platform Agnostic**: Single source of truth for all platforms\n- **Performance**: Optimized code generation with KSP\n- **Testing**: Testable localization logic\n- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns\n\n## Sources:\n- [i18n4k Documentation](https://comahe-de.github.io/i18n4k/)\n- [Kotlin KSP with Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-multiplatform.html)\n- [Using KSP with Kotlin Multiplatform: a quick overview](https://www.jacobras.nl/2024/02/using-ksp-with-kotlin-multiplatform-a-quick-overview/)\n- [Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization/)","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and run a KSP processor in a modern (K2-era) Kotlin Multiplatform project (e.g., using `ksp<target>`/`ksp<SourceSet>` and `kspCommonMainMetadata`) and show how that processor is used to generate type‑safe i18n resources or accessors from source files (such as message bundles) that work across platforms.

The two main options are:\n\n1. **i18n4k** - A comprehensive KMP i18n library with built-in code generation\n2. **MokoResources** - A resource management library that can be extended with custom KSP processors\n\n## Approach 1: Using i18n4k (Recommended)\n\n### Setup\n\nAdd to your `libs.versions.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[plugins]\nksp = { id = \"com.google.devtools.ksp\", version = \"2.1.0-1.0.29\" }\ni18n4k = { id = \"de.comahe.i18n4k\", version = \"0.11.1\" }\n```\n\nAdd to your module's `build.gradle.kts`:\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\")\n    id(\"de.comahe.i18n4k\")\n}\n\nkotlin {\n    jvm()\n    iosArm64()\n    iosX64()\n    iosSimulatorArm64()\n    \n    sourceSets {\n        commonMain.dependencies {\n            implementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core:0.11.1\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Configure i18n4k\ni18n4k {\n    sourceCodeLocales = listOf(\"en\", \"de\")\n    inputDirectory = \"src/commonMain/i18n\"\n}\n```\n\n### Create Message Bundles\n\nCreate property files in `src/commonMain/i18n/`:\n\n**MyMessages_en.properties**:\n```properties\nsayHello=Hello, {0}!\ntitle=Internationalization example\nerrorMessage=An error occurred: {error}\n```\n\n**MyMessages_de.properties**:\n```properties\nsayHello=Hallo, {0}!\ntitle=Internationalisierung Beispiel\nerrorMessage=Ein Fehler ist aufgetreten: {error}\n```\n\n### Generated Code\n\ni18n4k automatically generates type-safe accessors:\n\n```kotlin\nobject MyMessages : MessageBundle(\"MyMessages\", \"com.example\") {\n    val sayHello: LocalizedStringFactory1 = \n        getLocalizedStringFactory1(\"sayHello\", 0)\n    \n    val title: LocalizedString = \n        getLocalizedString0(\"title\", 1)\n    \n    val errorMessage: LocalizedStringFactory1 = \n        getLocalizedStringFactory1(\"errorMessage\", 2)\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```kotlin\n// Simple string\nprintln(MyMessages.title.toString())\n\n// String with parameters\nprintln(MyMessages.sayHello(\"World\"))\n\n// Change locale\nval config = I18n4kConfigDefault()\ni18n4k = config\nconfig.locale = Locale(\"de\")\n```\n\n## Approach 2: Custom KSP Processor with MokoResources\n\nFor more control, you can create a custom KSP processor:\n\n### Setup\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\")\n    id(\"dev.icerock.mobile.multiplatform-resources\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", project(\":i18n-generator\"))\n    add(\"kspJvm\", project(\":i18n-generator\"))\n    add(\"kspIosArm64\", project(\":i18n-generator\"))\n}\n```\n\n### Custom KSP Processor\n\nCreate a processor that generates type-safe resource keys:\n\n```kotlin\nclass I18nProcessor(\n    private val codeGenerator: CodeGenerator,\n    private val logger: KSPLogger\n) : SymbolProcessor {\n    \n    override fun process(resolver: Resolver): List<KSAnnotated> {\n        // Find resource files\n        val resourceFiles = findI18nResources()\n        \n        // Generate sealed classes for string keys\n        generateStringKeys(resourceFiles)\n        \n        return emptyList()\n    }\n    \n    private fun generateStringKeys(resources: Map<String, List<String>>) {\n        val fileSpec = FileSpec.builder(\"com.example.i18n\", \"StringKeys\")\n            .addType(\n                TypeSpec.classBuilder(\"StringResourceKey\")\n                    .modifiers(KModifier.SEALED)\n                    .apply {\n                        resources.forEach { (key, _) ->\n                            addType(\n                                TypeSpec.objectBuilder(key.capitalize())\n                                    .superclass(ClassName(\"\", \"StringResourceKey\"))\n                                    .build()\n                            )\n                        }\n                    }\n                    .build()\n            )\n            .build()\n        \n        val file = codeGenerator.createNewFile(\n            Dependencies(false),\n            \"com.example.i18n\",\n            \"StringKeys\"\n        )\n        file.write(fileSpec.toString().toByteArray())\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Localizer Interface\n\nCreate a platform-agnostic interface:\n\n```kotlin\ninterface Localizer {\n    fun getString(key: StringResourceKey): String\n    fun getString(key: StringResourceKey, vararg args: Any): String\n    fun getPlural(key: PluralsResourceKey, quantity: Int): String\n}\n```\n\n### Platform Implementations\n\n**Android**:\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocalizer(\n    private val context: Context\n) {\n    actual fun localized(stringDesc: StringDesc): String {\n        return stringDesc.toString(context)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**iOS**:\n```kotlin\nactual class PlatformLocalizer {\n    actual fun localized(stringDesc: StringDesc): String {\n        return stringDesc.localized()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## KSP Configuration for Multiplatform\n\n### Per-Target Configuration (KSP 1.0.1+)\n\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    // Common code\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    \n    // Per-target\n    add(\"kspJvm\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosArm64\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosX64\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    add(\"kspIosSimulatorArm64\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n    \n    // Test targets (optional)\n    add(\"kspJvmTest\", project(\":i18n-processor\"))\n}\n```\n\n### Avoid Old ksp() Configuration\n\nThe old `ksp()` configuration applies to all targets and is being deprecated. Use target-specific configurations for better performance.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Module Structure**: Separate concerns into three modules:\n   - `:i18n:generator` - KSP processor\n   - `:i18n:api` - Localizer interface\n   - `:i18n:implementation` - Platform implementations\n\n2. **Type Safety**: Use sealed classes for resource keys to prevent runtime errors\n\n3. **Testing**: Create platform-specific tests for localization:\n\n```kotlin\nabstract class LocalizerTest {\n    abstract val localizer: Localizer\n    \n    @Test\n    fun testLocalization() {\n        assertEquals(\"Hello\", localizer.getString(StringResourceKey.Greeting))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. **Compose Integration**: For Compose Multiplatform, configure output directory:\n\n```kotlin\ni18n4k {\n    languageFilesOutputDirectory = \n        \"{projectDir}/src/commonMain/composeResources/files/i18n\"\n}\n```\n\n## Key Advantages\n\n- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checks for resource keys\n- **Platform Agnostic**: Single source of truth for all platforms\n- **Performance**: Optimized code generation with KSP\n- **Testing**: Testable localization logic\n- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns\n\n## Sources:\n- [i18n4k Documentation](https://comahe-de.github.io/i18n4k/)\n- [Kotlin KSP with Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-multiplatform.html)\n- [Using KSP with Kotlin Multiplatform: a quick overview](https://www.jacobras.nl/2024/02/using-ksp-with-kotlin-multiplatform-a-quick-overview/)\n- [Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization/)","timestamp":51559}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Kotlin","lang":"Kotlin","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770547460689,"end":1770547512248,"firstResponse":51559,"sessionCreation":0,"total":51559},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.89,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Now I have comprehensive information about computing TTFB using httpx. Let me provide a detailed answer with code examples.\n\n## How to Compute TTFB Using HTTPX Trace Callback and Response Headers Timing in Python\n\nBased on the latest httpx documentation (2026), here are the primary methods to compute Time to First Byte (TTFB) in Python:\n\n### Method 1: Using HTTPX Trace Extension (Recommended)\n\nThe trace extension in httpx allows you to monitor internal events and calculate precise timing metrics including TTFB:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef compute_ttfb_with_trace():\n    timings = {}\n    \n    def trace_callback(event_name, info):\n        # Record timestamps for key events\n        if event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.started\" or \\\n           event_name == \"http2.send_request_headers.started\":\n            timings['request_sent'] = time.time()\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\" or \\\n             event_name == \"http2.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            timings['response_headers_received'] = time.time()\n    \n    client = httpx.Client()\n    start_time = time.time()\n    \n    response = client.get(\n        \"https://www.example.com/\",\n        extensions={\"trace\": trace_callback}\n    )\n    \n    # Calculate TTFB: time from request start to first response byte\n    if 'response_headers_received' in timings:\n        ttfb = timings['response_headers_received'] - start_time\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f} seconds\")\n    \n    client.close()\n    return ttfb\n\n# For async usage\nasync def compute_ttfb_async():\n    timings = {}\n    \n    async def async_trace_callback(event_name, info):\n        if event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.started\":\n            timings['request_sent'] = time.time()\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            timings['response_headers_received'] = time.time()\n    \n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        start_time = time.time()\n        response = await client.get(\n            \"https://www.example.com/\",\n            extensions={\"trace\": async_trace_callback}\n        )\n        ttfb = timings['response_headers_received'] - start_time\n        return ttfb\n```\n\n### Method 2: Detailed Timing with All Network Events\n\nFor more granular timing information including DNS, TCP connection, and TLS handshake:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef detailed_timing_analysis():\n    timings = {\n        'dns_start': None,\n        'dns_end': None,\n        'tcp_start': None,\n        'tcp_end': None,\n        'tls_start': None,\n        'tls_end': None,\n        'request_start': None,\n        'headers_received': None\n    }\n    \n    def trace_callback(event_name, info):\n        current_time = time.time()\n        \n        # DNS resolution\n        if event_name == \"connection.connect_tcp.started\":\n            timings['tcp_start'] = current_time\n        elif event_name == \"connection.connect_tcp.complete\":\n            timings['tcp_end'] = current_time\n        \n        # TLS handshake\n        elif event_name == \"connection.start_tls.started\":\n            timings['tls_start'] = current_time\n        elif event_name == \"connection.start_tls.complete\":\n            timings['tls_end'] = current_time\n        \n        # HTTP request/response\n        elif event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.started\":\n            timings['request_start'] = current_time\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            timings['headers_received'] = current_time\n    \n    with httpx.Client() as client:\n        start_time = time.time()\n        response = client.get(\n            \"https://www.example.com/\",\n            extensions={\"trace\": trace_callback}\n        )\n        \n        # Calculate metrics\n        dns_time = (timings['tcp_end'] - timings['tcp_start']) if timings['tcp_start'] else 0\n        tls_time = (timings['tls_end'] - timings['tls_start']) if timings['tls_start'] else 0\n        ttfb = timings['headers_received'] - start_time if timings['headers_received'] else 0\n        \n        print(f\"DNS + TCP Connection: {dns_time:.3f}s\")\n        print(f\"TLS Handshake: {tls_time:.3f}s\")\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f}s\")\n        print(f\"Status Code: {response.status_code}\")\n        \n        return {\n            'ttfb': ttfb,\n            'dns_time': dns_time,\n            'tls_time': tls_time\n        }\n```\n\n### Method 3: Simple TTFB Using Response Iteration\n\nFor a simpler approach without trace callbacks:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef simple_ttfb():\n    with httpx.Client() as client:\n        start_time = time.time()\n        \n        # Use stream to control when we read the first byte\n        with client.stream(\"GET\", \"https://www.example.com/\") as response:\n            # The headers are received at this point\n            ttfb = time.time() - start_time\n            \n            print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f}s\")\n            print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n            \n            # Optionally read the body\n            content = response.read()\n            total_time = time.time() - start_time\n            print(f\"Total Time: {total_time:.3f}s\")\n            \n        return ttfb\n```\n\n### Method 4: Using Event Hooks for Logging\n\nEvent hooks can be used alongside trace for monitoring:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef log_request(request):\n    request.extensions['start_time'] = time.time()\n    print(f\"Request: {request.method} {request.url}\")\n\ndef log_response(response):\n    start_time = response.request.extensions.get('start_time')\n    if start_time:\n        ttfb = time.time() - start_time\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f}s - Status: {response.status_code}\")\n\nclient = httpx.Client(\n    event_hooks={\n        'request': [log_request],\n        'response': [log_response]\n    }\n)\n\nresponse = client.get(\"https://www.example.com/\")\nclient.close()\n```\n\n### Key Trace Events for TTFB Calculation:\n\n**HTTP/1.1:**\n- `http11.send_request_headers.started` -

Now I have comprehensive information about computing TTFB using httpx. Let me provide a detailed answer with code examples.\n\n## How to Compute TTFB Using HTTPX Trace Callback and Response Headers Timing in Python\n\nBased on the latest httpx documentation (2026), here are the primary methods to compute Time to First Byte (TTFB) in Python:\n\n### Method 1: Using HTTPX Trace Extension (Recommended)\n\nThe trace extension in httpx allows you to monitor internal events and calculate precise timing metrics including TTFB:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef compute_ttfb_with_trace():\n    timings = {}\n    \n    def trace_callback(event_name, info):\n        # Record timestamps for key events\n        if event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.started\" or \\\n           event_name == \"http2.send_request_headers.started\":\n            timings['request_sent'] = time.time()\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\" or \\\n             event_name == \"http2.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            timings['response_headers_received'] = time.time()\n    \n    client = httpx.Client()\n    start_time = time.time()\n    \n    response = client.get(\n        \"https://www.example.com/\",\n        extensions={\"trace\": trace_callback}\n    )\n    \n    # Calculate TTFB: time from request start to first response byte\n    if 'response_headers_received' in timings:\n        ttfb = timings['response_headers_received'] - start_time\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f} seconds\")\n    \n    client.close()\n    return ttfb\n\n# For async usage\nasync def compute_ttfb_async():\n    timings = {}\n    \n    async def async_trace_callback(event_name, info):\n        if event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.started\":\n            timings['request_sent'] = time.time()\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            timings['response_headers_received'] = time.time()\n    \n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        start_time = time.time()\n        response = await client.get(\n            \"https://www.example.com/\",\n            extensions={\"trace\": async_trace_callback}\n        )\n        ttfb = timings['response_headers_received'] - start_time\n        return ttfb\n```\n\n### Method 2: Detailed Timing with All Network Events\n\nFor more granular timing information including DNS, TCP connection, and TLS handshake:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef detailed_timing_analysis():\n    timings = {\n        'dns_start': None,\n        'dns_end': None,\n        'tcp_start': None,\n        'tcp_end': None,\n        'tls_start': None,\n        'tls_end': None,\n        'request_start': None,\n        'headers_received': None\n    }\n    \n    def trace_callback(event_name, info):\n        current_time = time.time()\n        \n        # DNS resolution\n        if event_name == \"connection.connect_tcp.started\":\n            timings['tcp_start'] = current_time\n        elif event_name == \"connection.connect_tcp.complete\":\n            timings['tcp_end'] = current_time\n        \n        # TLS handshake\n        elif event_name == \"connection.start_tls.started\":\n            timings['tls_start'] = current_time\n        elif event_name == \"connection.start_tls.complete\":\n            timings['tls_end'] = current_time\n        \n        # HTTP request/response\n        elif event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.started\":\n            timings['request_start'] = current_time\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            timings['headers_received'] = current_time\n    \n    with httpx.Client() as client:\n        start_time = time.time()\n        response = client.get(\n            \"https://www.example.com/\",\n            extensions={\"trace\": trace_callback}\n        )\n        \n        # Calculate metrics\n        dns_time = (timings['tcp_end'] - timings['tcp_start']) if timings['tcp_start'] else 0\n        tls_time = (timings['tls_end'] - timings['tls_start']) if timings['tls_start'] else 0\n        ttfb = timings['headers_received'] - start_time if timings['headers_received'] else 0\n        \n        print(f\"DNS + TCP Connection: {dns_time:.3f}s\")\n        print(f\"TLS Handshake: {tls_time:.3f}s\")\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f}s\")\n        print(f\"Status Code: {response.status_code}\")\n        \n        return {\n            'ttfb': ttfb,\n            'dns_time': dns_time,\n            'tls_time': tls_time\n        }\n```\n\n### Method 3: Simple TTFB Using Response Iteration\n\nFor a simpler approach without trace callbacks:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef simple_ttfb():\n    with httpx.Client() as client:\n        start_time = time.time()\n        \n        # Use stream to control when we read the first byte\n        with client.stream(\"GET\", \"https://www.example.com/\") as response:\n            # The headers are received at this point\n            ttfb = time.time() - start_time\n            \n            print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f}s\")\n            print(f\"Status: {response.status_code}\")\n            \n            # Optionally read the body\n            content = response.read()\n            total_time = time.time() - start_time\n            print(f\"Total Time: {total_time:.3f}s\")\n            \n        return ttfb\n```\n\n### Method 4: Using Event Hooks for Logging\n\nEvent hooks can be used alongside trace for monitoring:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef log_request(request):\n    request.extensions['start_time'] = time.time()\n    print(f\"Request: {request.method} {request.url}\")\n\ndef log_response(response):\n    start_time = response.request.extensions.get('start_time')\n    if start_time:\n        ttfb = time.time() - start_time\n        print(f\"TTFB: {ttfb:.3f}s - Status: {response.status_code}\")\n\nclient = httpx.Client(\n    event_hooks={\n        'request': [log_request],\n        'response': [log_response]\n    }\n)\n\nresponse = client.get(\"https://www.example.com/\")\nclient.close()\n```\n\n### Key Trace Events for TTFB Calculation:\n\n**HTTP/1.1:**\n- `http11.send_request_headers.started` - Request headers being sent\n- `http11.receive_response_headers.complete` - Response headers received (TTFB point)\n\n**HTTP/2:**\n- `http2.send_request_headers.started` - Request headers being sent\n- `http2.receive_response_headers.complete` - Response headers received (TTFB point)\n\n**Connection Events:**\n- `connection.connect_tcp.started/complete` - TCP connection timing\n- `connection.start_tls.started/complete` - TLS handshake timing\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n1. **Async Support**: When using `httpx.AsyncClient`, the trace callback must be an `async def` function\n2. **Connection Pooling**: Use `httpx.Client()` for connection reuse across requests\n3. **HTTP Version**: Check `response.extensions[\"http_version\"]` to see which protocol was used\n4. **Precision**: Trace callbacks provide the most accurate timing as they hook into internal httpcore events\n\nSources:\n- [HTTPX Extensions Documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/extensions/)\n- [HTTPX Event Hooks Documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/event-hooks/)\n- [HTTPX Client Documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/clients/)\n- [Stack Overflow: Getting TTFB for HTTP Request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/744532/getting-ttfb-time-till-first-byte-for-an-http-request)","timestamp":52747}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"HTTPX tracing","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770547527330,"end":1770547580077,"firstResponse":52747,"sessionCreation":0,"total":52747},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.89,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Creating a Checkout Session via API\n\n### Endpoint\n```\nPOST https://api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts\n```\n(Use `https://sandbox-api.polar.sh` for testing)\n\n### Authentication\nYou need an **Organization Access Token** which can be generated from your organization's settings. Pass it in the `Authorization` header.\n\n### Basic Example (TypeScript/JavaScript)\n\n```typescript\nimport { Polar } from \"@polar-sh/sdk\";\n\nconst polar = new Polar({\n  accessToken: process.env[\"POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"] ?? \"\",\n});\n\nasync function run() {\n  const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({\n    products: [\"productId\"]  // Array of product IDs\n  });\n\n  console.log(checkout.url);  // Redirect customers to this URL\n}\n\nrun();\n```\n\n### Basic Example (Go)\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport(\n    \"context\"\n    \"os\"\n    polargo \"github.com/polarsource/polar-go\"\n    \"github.com/polarsource/polar-go/models/components\"\n    \"log\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    ctx := context.Background()\n    \n    s := polargo.New(\n        polargo.WithSecurity(os.Getenv(\"POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN\")),\n    )\n    \n    res, err := s.Checkouts.Create(ctx, components.CheckoutCreate{\n        Products: []string{\"productId1\", \"productId2\"},\n    })\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    if res.Checkout != nil {\n        // Redirect customer to res.Checkout.Url\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Key Request Parameters\n\n### Required:\n- **`products`** (array of strings): List of product IDs (minimum 1). First product is selected by default.\n\n### Optional but Important:\n- **`success_url`**: URL to redirect after successful payment (can include `checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}` parameter)\n- **`return_url`**: Shows a back button to return to this URL\n- **`customer_email`**: Pre-fill customer email\n- **`customer_name`**: Pre-fill customer name\n- **`customer_id`**: Link to existing Polar customer\n- **`external_customer_id`**: Your system's customer ID for reconciliation\n- **`metadata`**: Key-value object for storing additional information (max 50 pairs)\n- **`discount_id`**: Apply a specific discount\n- **`allow_discount_codes`**: Allow/disallow discount codes (default: true)\n- **`amount`**: For custom \"pay-what-you-want\" pricing (in cents)\n- **`seats`**: Number of seats for seat-based pricing\n- **`allow_trial`**: Enable/disable trial period (default: true)\n- **`embed_origin`**: Origin URL if embedding checkout in iframe\n\n## 3. Ad-hoc Prices (Advanced)\n\nCreate temporary prices specific to a checkout session:\n\n```typescript\nconst checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({\n  products: [\"productId\"],\n  prices: {\n    \"productId\": [\n      {\n        amountType: \"fixed\",\n        priceAmount: 10000,  // $100.00 in cents\n        priceCurrency: \"usd\",\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Supported price types:**\n- Fixed\n- Custom (pay-what-you-want)\n- Free\n- Seat-based\n- Metered (usage-based)\n\n## 4. Response\n\nThe API returns a checkout session object with:\n- **`id`**: Checkout session ID\n- **`url`**: Customer checkout URL (redirect here)\n- **`client_secret`**: For client-side updates\n- **`status`**: `open`, `expired`, `confirmed`, `succeeded`, or `failed`\n- **`expires_at`**: Session expiration timestamp\n- **`amount`**, **`tax_amount`**, **`total_amount`**: Pricing details\n- Full product, customer, and metadata information\n\n### Status Flow:\n1. **Open**: Checkout session created and accessible\n2. **Confirmed**: User clicked Pay (payment processing)\n3. **Succeeded**: Payment completed successfully\n4. **Failed**: Payment failed (rare)\n5. **Expired**: Session expired (no longer accessible)\n\n## 5. Creating Checkout Links (No-Code Alternative)\n\nInstead of API calls, you can create **Checkout Links** in the Polar dashboard:\n\n### Steps:\n1. Go to **Products** → **Checkout Links**\n2. Click **New Link**\n3. Configure:\n   - **Label**: Internal name\n   - **Products**: Select one or multiple products\n   - **Discount**: Preset discount or disable codes\n   - **Metadata**: Additional key-value data\n4. Share the generated link\n\n### Query Parameters for Checkout Links:\n```\nhttps://polar.sh/checkout/your-link?customer_email=john@example.com&customer_name=John%20Doe&discount_code=SAVE20&amount=5000\n```\n\n**Available parameters:**\n- `customer_email`\n- `customer_name`\n- `discount_code`\n- `amount` (for pay-what-you-want)\n- `custom_field_data.{slug}` (custom field prefills)\n- UTM parameters: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`\n- `reference_id` (your own reference)\n\n## 6. Best Practices\n\n1. **Always use the checkout link URL**, not the temporary session URL (sessions expire)\n2. **Store `external_customer_id`** for easy reconciliation with your system\n3. **Use metadata** to track context (campaign, source, etc.)\n4. **Multiple products**: Allow customers to switch between options at checkout\n5. **Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive payment confirmation events\n6. **Embed origin**: Required if embedding checkout in an iframe for security\n\n## 7. Finding Your Product ID\n\n1. Go to **Products** in your dashboard\n2. Click the context menu (⋯) next to your product\n3. Select **Copy Product ID**\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Create Checkout Session - Polar.sh Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/api-reference/checkouts/create-session)\n- [Checkout API - Polar.sh Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/features/checkout/session)\n- [Checkout Links - Polar.sh Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/features/checkout/links)","hint":"A correct answer should state that you must use the Polar API (or official SDK) with an Organization Access Token to call the “create checkout session” endpoint (or equivalent) specifying product/price and redirect URLs, and then obtain or construct the resulting checkout URL/payment link (or use the documented “Checkout Link” creation flow in the dashboard) that can be shared with customers.【page1websearch1 page3websearch1 page6websearch1 page7websearch1","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about creating checkout sessions and payment links using the Polar.sh API.","timestamp":42285},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":42285},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EadiuLCcqvrgb7M4HDYEXs","status":"completed","timestamp":42285},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me fetch the detailed content from the most relevant documentation pages:","timestamp":42285},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":42285},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019ygPth25sFMU9up16TwGUA","status":"completed","timestamp":42285},{"type":"message","content":"Let me also get the content from the Checkout API and Checkout Links pages:","timestamp":42285},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":42285},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HdSkGiSN2KYRncquK82bqx","status":"completed","timestamp":42285},{"type":"message","content":"# How to Create a Checkout Session and Payment Link Using Polar.sh API (2026)\n\nBased on the official Polar.sh API documentation, here's a comprehensive guide:\n\n## 1.

Ad-hoc Prices (Advanced)\n\nCreate temporary prices specific to a checkout session:\n\n```typescript\nconst checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({\n  products: [\"productId\"],\n  prices: {\n    \"productId\": [\n      {\n        amountType: \"fixed\",\n        priceAmount: 10000,  // $100.00 in cents\n        priceCurrency: \"usd\",\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Supported price types:**\n- Fixed\n- Custom (pay-what-you-want)\n- Free\n- Seat-based\n- Metered (usage-based)\n\n## 4. Response\n\nThe API returns a checkout session object with:\n- **`id`**: Checkout session ID\n- **`url`**: Customer checkout URL (redirect here)\n- **`client_secret`**: For client-side updates\n- **`status`**: `open`, `expired`, `confirmed`, `succeeded`, or `failed`\n- **`expires_at`**: Session expiration timestamp\n- **`amount`**, **`tax_amount`**, **`total_amount`**: Pricing details\n- Full product, customer, and metadata information\n\n### Status Flow:\n1. **Open**: Checkout session created and accessible\n2. **Confirmed**: User clicked Pay (payment processing)\n3. **Succeeded**: Payment completed successfully\n4. **Failed**: Payment failed (rare)\n5. **Expired**: Session expired (no longer accessible)\n\n## 5. Creating Checkout Links (No-Code Alternative)\n\nInstead of API calls, you can create **Checkout Links** in the Polar dashboard:\n\n### Steps:\n1. Go to **Products** → **Checkout Links**\n2. Click **New Link**\n3. Configure:\n   - **Label**: Internal name\n   - **Products**: Select one or multiple products\n   - **Discount**: Preset discount or disable codes\n   - **Metadata**: Additional key-value data\n4. Share the generated link\n\n### Query Parameters for Checkout Links:\n```\nhttps://polar.sh/checkout/your-link?customer_email=john@example.com&customer_name=John%20Doe&discount_code=SAVE20&amount=5000\n```\n\n**Available parameters:**\n- `customer_email`\n- `customer_name`\n- `discount_code`\n- `amount` (for pay-what-you-want)\n- `custom_field_data.{slug}` (custom field prefills)\n- UTM parameters: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`\n- `reference_id` (your own reference)\n\n## 6. Best Practices\n\n1. **Always use the checkout link URL**, not the temporary session URL (sessions expire)\n2. **Store `external_customer_id`** for easy reconciliation with your system\n3. **Use metadata** to track context (campaign, source, etc.)\n4. **Multiple products**: Allow customers to switch between options at checkout\n5. **Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive payment confirmation events\n6. **Embed origin**: Required if embedding checkout in an iframe for security\n\n## 7. Finding Your Product ID\n\n1. Go to **Products** in your dashboard\n2. Click the context menu (⋯) next to your product\n3. Select **Copy Product ID**\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Create Checkout Session - Polar.sh Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/api-reference/checkouts/create-session)\n- [Checkout API - Polar.sh Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/features/checkout/session)\n- [Checkout Links - Polar.sh Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/features/checkout/links)","timestamp":42285}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Polar_API","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770547744128,"end":1770547786413,"firstResponse":42285,"sessionCreation":0,"total":42285},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Multi-Agent Orchestration Platforms**\nOrganizations are moving beyond single AI agents to coordinated multi-agent systems that can:\n- Divide complex tasks across specialized agents\n- Handle enterprise workflows with multiple AI agents working in parallel\n- Coordinate actions through centralized orchestration frameworks\n\n### **2. Hierarchical Agent Architectures**\nNew patterns emerging include:\n- **Manager-Worker Models**: Supervisor agents that delegate tasks to specialized worker agents\n- **Handoff Mechanisms**: Agents that can route requests to the most appropriate specialist agent\n- **Routines & Coordination**: Structured workflows where agents follow predefined collaboration patterns\n\n### **3. Agent Swarms**\n- **Collaborative swarms**: Multiple autonomous agents working together without central control\n- **Emergent behavior**: Agents coordinate through communication protocols rather than top-down management\n- **Parallel processing**: Distributing tasks across agent teams for faster execution\n\n### **4. Domain-Specific Multi-Agent Teams**\nIndustries are deploying specialized agent teams:\n- Healthcare: Multi-agent systems for diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management\n- Enterprise: Coordinated agents for customer service, data analysis, and automation\n- Development: Teams of coding agents working on different parts of software projects (like Anthropic's demonstration of building a C compiler with autonomous agent teams)\n\n### **5. Orchestration Frameworks**\nKey frameworks gaining traction in 2026:\n- **OpenAI Swarm**: Focus on routines and handoffs between agents\n- **Amazon Strands Agents**: Multi-agent collaboration patterns\n- **Agentic AI Platforms**: Specialized platforms for managing agent lifecycles, coordination, and governance\n\n### **6. The Agentic Enterprise**\nOrganizations are becoming \"agentic\" by:\n- Managing machines that manage themselves\n- Creating AI-native product organizations\n- Evolving from pyramid workforce structures to flatter, agent-augmented teams\n\n### **7. Governance & Explainability**\nAs multi-agent systems scale, emphasis on:\n- **Explainable AI**: Understanding how agent teams make decisions\n- **Governed systems**: Ensuring agent coordination follows business rules and compliance\n- **Trust & transparency**: Making agent interactions auditable\n\n### **8.

Hierarchical Agent Architectures**\nNew patterns emerging include:\n- **Manager-Worker Models**: Supervisor agents that delegate tasks to specialized worker agents\n- **Handoff Mechanisms**: Agents that can route requests to the most appropriate specialist agent\n- **Routines & Coordination**: Structured workflows where agents follow predefined collaboration patterns\n\n### **3. Agent Swarms**\n- **Collaborative swarms**: Multiple autonomous agents working together without central control\n- **Emergent behavior**: Agents coordinate through communication protocols rather than top-down management\n- **Parallel processing**: Distributing tasks across agent teams for faster execution\n\n### **4. Domain-Specific Multi-Agent Teams**\nIndustries are deploying specialized agent teams:\n- Healthcare: Multi-agent systems for diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management\n- Enterprise: Coordinated agents for customer service, data analysis, and automation\n- Development: Teams of coding agents working on different parts of software projects (like Anthropic's demonstration of building a C compiler with autonomous agent teams)\n\n### **5. Orchestration Frameworks**\nKey frameworks gaining traction in 2026:\n- **OpenAI Swarm**: Focus on routines and handoffs between agents\n- **Amazon Strands Agents**: Multi-agent collaboration patterns\n- **Agentic AI Platforms**: Specialized platforms for managing agent lifecycles, coordination, and governance\n\n### **6. The Agentic Enterprise**\nOrganizations are becoming \"agentic\" by:\n- Managing machines that manage themselves\n- Creating AI-native product organizations\n- Evolving from pyramid workforce structures to flatter, agent-augmented teams\n\n### **7. Governance & Explainability**\nAs multi-agent systems scale, emphasis on:\n- **Explainable AI**: Understanding how agent teams make decisions\n- **Governed systems**: Ensuring agent coordination follows business rules and compliance\n- **Trust & transparency**: Making agent interactions auditable\n\n### **8. Scale & Strategy Challenges**\nOrganizations face new challenges:\n- Coordinating agents at scale across enterprise systems\n- Preventing agent conflicts and ensuring consistent behavior\n- Managing the \"machines that manage themselves\"\n- IT teams dealing with increased complexity and potential outages\n\n**Sources:**\n- [AI Agent Orchestration in 2026: Coordination, Scale and Strategy](https://kanerika.com/blogs/ai-agent-orchestration/)\n- [Multi-Agent AI Systems: The Complete Enterprise Guide for 2026](https://neomanex.com/posts/multi-agent-ai-systems-orchestration)\n- [15 AI Agents Trends to Watch in 2026](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2026/01/ai-agents-trends/)\n- [Leading in the Age of AI Agents: Managing the Machines That Manage](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/machines-that-manage-themselves)\n- [The Emerging Agentic Enterprise](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/the-emerging-agentic-enterprise-how-leaders-must-navigate-a-new-age-of-ai/)\n- [Multi-Agent collaboration patterns with Strands Agents and Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/multi-agent-collaboration-patterns-with-strands-agents-and-amazon-nova/)\n- [Top 9 AI Agent Frameworks in 2026](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/AI/top-9-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2026)\n- [OpenAI's Swarm AI agent framework: Routines and handoffs](https://venturebeat.com/ai/openais-swarm-ai-agent-framework-routines-and-handoffs)","timestamp":50031}],"metadata":{"category":"Research","subcategory":"AI_Agents","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770548192566,"end":1770548242597,"firstResponse":50031,"sessionCreation":0,"total":50031},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.89,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Based on the search results, here's how to fix PyTorch model loading deadlocks when using multiprocessing in 2026:\n\n## Common Causes and Solutions\n\n### 1. **Use the Correct Process Start Method**\n\nThe most critical fix is to avoid using the `fork` start method with CUDA/accelerators. Use `spawn` or `forkserver` instead:\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n# Set the start method at the beginning of your script\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)  # or 'forkserver'\n    # Your multiprocessing code here\n```\n\nOr use context manager:\n```python\nctx = mp.get_context('spawn')\npool = ctx.Pool(processes=4)\n```\n\n### 2. **Guard Model Loading with `if __name__ == '__main__'`**\n\nAlways initialize the accelerator and load models inside the main guard to prevent \"poison fork\":\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint.pt'))\n    # Then spawn processes\n```\n\n### 3. **Load State Dict Inside Worker Processes**\n\nInstead of loading in the main process before forking, load weights inside each worker:\n\n```python\ndef worker(gpu_id, checkpoint_path):\n    torch.cuda.set_device(gpu_id)\n    model = MyModel().cuda(gpu_id)\n    \n    # Load checkpoint inside the worker process\n    checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location=f'cuda:{gpu_id}')\n    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint)\n    \n    # Continue training...\n```\n\n### 4. **Fix State Dict Key Mismatches**\n\nMismatches between model keys (e.g., `module.` prefix from DDP) can cause deadlocks:\n\n```python\ncheckpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location=f'cuda:{rank}')\n\n# Remove 'module.' prefix if present\nif list(checkpoint.keys())[0].startswith('module.'):\n    checkpoint = {k.replace('module.', ''): v for k, v in checkpoint.items()}\n\nmodel.load_state_dict(checkpoint)\n```\n\n### 5. **Use SimpleQueue Instead of Queue**\n\nFor passing data between processes, use `SimpleQueue` to avoid threading issues:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import SimpleQueue\nqueue = SimpleQueue()  # Instead of Queue()\n```\n\n### 6. **Avoid CPU Oversubscription**\n\nSet the number of threads per process to prevent resource contention:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport math\n\ndef worker(rank, num_processes):\n    # Calculate threads per process\n    num_cpus = os.cpu_count()\n    threads_per_process = math.floor(num_cpus / num_processes)\n    torch.set_num_threads(threads_per_process)\n    \n    # Your training code...\n```\n\n### 7. **Handle Filesystem Issues**\n\nIf using distributed systems/clusters, ensure checkpoint paths are accessible and use proper error handling:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nif not os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):\n    raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Checkpoint not found: {checkpoint_path}\")\n\ncheckpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location='cpu')  # Load to CPU first\nmodel.load_state_dict(checkpoint)\nmodel = model.cuda(gpu_id)  # Then move to GPU\n```\n\n## Complete Example with Best Practices\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\nimport os\n\ndef train_worker(rank, world_size, checkpoint_path):\n    # Set device\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)\n    \n    # Avoid CPU oversubscription\n    torch.set_num_threads(max(1, os.cpu_count() // world_size))\n    \n    # Initialize model\n    model = MyModel().cuda(rank)\n    \n    # Load checkpoint inside worker\n    if checkpoint_path and os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):\n        checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location=f'cuda:{rank}')\n        # Handle potential key mismatches\n        if 'module.' in list(checkpoint.keys())[0]:\n            checkpoint = {k.replace('module.', ''): v for k, v in checkpoint.items()}\n        model.load_state_dict(checkpoint)\n    \n    # Wrap with DDP\n    model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])\n    \n    # Training loop...\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    world_size = 4\n    checkpoint_path = 'model.pt'\n    \n    # Use spawn method\n    mp.spawn(\n        train_worker,\n        args=(world_size, checkpoint_path),\n        nprocs=world_size,\n        join=True\n    )\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways for 2026\n\n1. **Always use `spawn` or `forkserver`** - never use `fork` with CUDA\n2. **Load weights inside worker processes** - not in the main process before forking\n3. **Guard initialization code** with `if __name__ == '__main__'`\n4. **Check for state dict key mismatches** (especially with DDP's `module.` prefix)\n5. **Set appropriate thread counts** to avoid CPU oversubscription\n6. **Use `map_location`** when loading to ensure proper device placement\n\n**Sources:**\n- [PyTorch Multiprocessing Best Practices — PyTorch 2.10 documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html)\n- [Change model size or load weights will cause multiprocessing deadlock · Issue #123828](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/123828)\n- [Load_state_dict causing deadlock in multiprocessing training -

This bypasses the configured `maxContentLength` and `maxBodyLength` limits.\n\n**Impact:** An attacker can supply a very large data: URI causing the Node.js process to allocate excessive memory and crash, even when `responseType: 'stream'` is specified.\n\n**Affected Versions:** Axios < 1.11.0\n\n**Fixed Versions:** Axios 1.12.0 (patched in September 2025)\n\n**Published:** September 12, 2025\n\n**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Upgrade to Axios 1.12.0 immediately\n- Enforce size limits by inspecting Base64 payload length before decoding\n- Implement stream decoding to process chunks incrementally\n- Avoid processing untrusted data: URIs\n\n---\n\n## **CVE-2024-37890** - ws (WebSocket) Library Vulnerability\n\n**Affected Component:** ws WebSocket library for Node.js (NOT Langfuse)\n\n**Vulnerability Type:** Denial of Service (DoS)\n\n**Description:** A request with a number of headers exceeding the `server.maxHeadersCount` threshold could be used to crash a ws server.\n\n**Affected Versions:** Multiple versions of ws library\n\n**Fixed Versions:** \n- ws@8.17.1\n- ws@7.5.10 (backport)\n- ws@6.2.3 (backport)\n- ws@5.2.4 (backport)\n\n**Published:** June 17, 2024\n\n**CVSS Score:** Not specified in the sources, but classified as a DoS vulnerability\n\n**Mitigation:**\n1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of request headers using `--max-http-header-size=size` and/or the `maxHeaderSize` options\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to 0 so no limit is applied\n3. Upgrade to patched versions\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nNone of these CVEs are specific Langfuse vulnerabilities. They are vulnerabilities in common JavaScript/Node.js libraries (form-data, Axios, and ws) that might be used as dependencies in various applications, potentially including Langfuse. If Langfuse uses any of these libraries, it would be affected indirectly as a downstream dependency issue.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [NVD - CVE-2025-7783](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7783)\n- [Wiz Vulnerability Database - CVE-2025-58754](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-58754)\n- [GitHub Advisory - CVE-2025-58754](https://github.com/axios/axios/security/advisories/GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj)\n- [Security Online - CVE-2025-58754](https://securityonline.info/cve-2025-58754-axios-vulnerability-puts-node-js-processes-at-risk-of-dos-attacks/)\n- [NVD - CVE-2024-37890](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-37890)\n- [Wiz Vulnerability Database - CVE-2024-37890](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2024-37890)","timestamp":38263}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"Langfuse","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770548484650,"end":1770548522913,"firstResponse":38263,"sessionCreation":0,"total":38263},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

Published in January 2026, this technique progressively trains models from easier to harder tasks, optimizing data selection based on difficulty levels\n- **Curriculum-RLAIF** - Uses curriculum alignment with RL from AI feedback, selecting training examples in a structured progression to improve reasoning capabilities\n\n### 2. **Process Reward Models (PRMs) vs Outcome Reward Models (ORMs)**\n- **Process Reward Models** have become dominant for reasoning tasks, providing feedback at each step rather than just the final answer\n- These enable better data selection by identifying which reasoning steps are correct, allowing filtering of high-quality reasoning traces\n- **Conditional Reward Modeling** - Links process to outcome, enabling more sophisticated data selection based on both intermediate steps and final results\n\n### 3. **Online vs Offline RL Data Selection**\n- **Online RL** - Models generate new reasoning traces during training, selecting data dynamically based on current model capabilities\n- **Offline RL** - Uses pre-collected datasets but with sophisticated selection mechanisms to choose high-quality examples\n- **PCL-Reasoner-V1.5** - Advances math reasoning specifically using offline RL with careful data curation\n\n### 4. **DeepSeek-R1 Approach (January 2025)**\n- Uses pure RL without supervised fine-tuning, allowing the model to discover its own reasoning patterns\n- Employs **group relative policy optimization** for data selection\n- Focuses on self-evolved reasoning data rather than human-labeled examples\n- Represents a shift toward models generating and selecting their own training data\n\n### 5. **Multi-Objective Reward Modeling**\n- Enables selection of data that satisfies multiple criteria simultaneously (accuracy, reasoning quality, interpretability)\n- Provides more nuanced data filtering than single-objective approaches\n\n### 6. **Active Learning and Sample Efficiency**\n- **RhymeRL** and similar techniques accelerate RL by selecting the most informative examples\n- Focuses on reducing redundancy and maximizing information gain per training sample\n- Uses historical patterns to identify which data will be most valuable\n\n### 7. **Semantic and Token Entropy Regularization**\n- Recent work (December 2025) on using entropy measures to select diverse, high-quality reasoning examples\n- Prevents overfitting to specific reasoning patterns by ensuring data diversity\n\n## Emerging Trends (2025-2026)\n\n- **Self-evolving data selection** - Models autonomously identify and generate high-quality reasoning examples\n- **Minimal human supervision** - Shift from human-labeled preference data to automated quality assessment\n- **Integrated curriculum + RL** - Combining curriculum learning with online RL for adaptive data selection\n- **Process-level filtering** - Moving beyond outcome-based selection to step-by-step reasoning quality\n\nThe field is rapidly moving from static, human-curated datasets toward dynamic, model-driven data selection that adapts during training and focuses on reasoning process quality rather than just final outcomes.\n\n## Sources:\n- [The State of Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/the-state-of-llm-reasoning-model-training)\n- [A Technical Survey of Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.04136v1)\n- [Toward large reasoning models: A survey of reinforced reasoning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389925002181)\n- [TACLer: Tailored Curriculum Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.21711)\n- [Curriculum Reinforcement Learning from Easy to Hard Tasks](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.06632)\n- [DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.12948v1)\n- [From Zero to Reasoning Hero: How DeepSeek-R1 Leverages Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/blog/NormalUhr/deepseek-r1-explained)\n- [Online versus Offline RL for LLMs](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/online-rl)\n- [Reward Models](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/reward-models)\n- [Linking Process to Outcome: Conditional Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.26578)\n- [Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Semantic and Token Entropy](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.04359v2)\n- [The State of RL in 2025](https://www.turingpost.com/p/stateofrl2025)","hint":"Answers must mention concrete 2024–2025 work on data selection or curriculum for RL-trained reasoning LLMs (e.g., dynamic or difficulty-aware sampling, self-evolving curricula, selective rollout, or rejection-sampling–based selection) and correctly tie these to reasoning-focused RL pipelines (e.g., RLVR/GRPO-style training, curriculum learning for math/code reasoning, or test-time trajectory filtering), not just generic RLHF or pre-2024 methods.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025.","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01T5hLhNhZEgkqWSJiUj7TL2","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed content from the most relevant articles:","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MDM7a6wSaBeRph3VCZjyTE","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015RehwvKUFAebXuis5f74L4","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011VdqfFtet7tKWFuKpxfZ4F","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Ub8XRjk3yWCZRhuypPZvqq","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018q1gaTj3CAGewDgbq5AVNe","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0127XErzAD87KhYcDhnQnimS","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012dgwVSpFPdey9KWYqP8F5r","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011dkJv89Qjm6JW8zMHfC28u","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LEd9nrigCvcnPp4ka7acfD","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017CyhUXeVSUPE8GWw6uYvz4","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WxpM6SSCjXqXm2VddpHfmJ","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Tvig2fk1G2sRKpphUQ3K9L","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011HhRn6z1awAk74mxJbQdkd","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":71714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01TTBVkn3gEYnmdbuJzYnfaT","status":"completed","timestamp":71714},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search of recent research and developments in 2024-2025, here are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning:\n\n## Key Data Selection Techniques\n\n### 1. **Curriculum Learning Approaches**\n- **TACLer (Tailored Curriculum RL)** -

Install Node.js and NPM\n2. Install Chromium\n3. Clone the [extension-update-testing-tool](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/extension-update-testing-tool) repository\n4. Run `npm install` in the repository root\n\n**Usage:**\n1. Run `npm start`\n2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in Chromium\n3. Drag and drop your unpacked extension (folder or .zip file) onto the page\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the extension manually\n5. To test updates: modify your extension, increase the version number, and drag/drop again\n6. Click **Update** on `chrome://extensions`\n\n### 2. **Using chrome.management API** (Programmatic Method)\n\nAs a workaround, you can use the `chrome.management.getPermissionWarningsByManifest()` API:\n\n```javascript\nconst manifestString = `\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"tabs\",\n    \"downloads\",\n    \"storage\"\n  ]\n}`;\n\nchrome.management.getPermissionWarningsByManifest(\n  manifestString,\n  warnings => {\n    for (let warning of warnings) {\n      console.log(warning);\n    }\n  }\n);\n// Example output:\n// \"Read your browsing history\"\n// \"Manage your downloads\"\n```\n\n**Note:** This method doesn't require the `\"management\"` permission and can be run from any extension.\n\n### 3. **Manual Packing Method** (Traditional Approach)\n\n**Initial Pack:**\n1. Go to `chrome://extensions`\n2. Enable Developer mode\n3. Click **Pack extension**\n4. Specify your extension's root directory path\n5. Leave the **Private key file** field empty for first-time packing\n6. Click **Pack extension** - this creates `.crx` and `.pem` files\n7. **Save the `.pem` file securely** - you'll need it for updates\n8. Drag and drop the `.crx` file onto `chrome://extensions` to install\n\n**Testing Permission Updates:**\n1. Add a new permission that triggers warnings to your `manifest.json`\n2. Increase the version number in `manifest.json`\n3. Go to `chrome://extensions` (**don't uninstall the existing extension**)\n4.

Install Node.js and NPM\n2. Install Chromium\n3. Clone the [extension-update-testing-tool](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/extension-update-testing-tool) repository\n4. Run `npm install` in the repository root\n\n**Usage:**\n1. Run `npm start`\n2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in Chromium\n3. Drag and drop your unpacked extension (folder or .zip file) onto the page\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the extension manually\n5. To test updates: modify your extension, increase the version number, and drag/drop again\n6. Click **Update** on `chrome://extensions`\n\n### 2. **Using chrome.management API** (Programmatic Method)\n\nAs a workaround, you can use the `chrome.management.getPermissionWarningsByManifest()` API:\n\n```javascript\nconst manifestString = `\n{\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"tabs\",\n    \"downloads\",\n    \"storage\"\n  ]\n}`;\n\nchrome.management.getPermissionWarningsByManifest(\n  manifestString,\n  warnings => {\n    for (let warning of warnings) {\n      console.log(warning);\n    }\n  }\n);\n// Example output:\n// \"Read your browsing history\"\n// \"Manage your downloads\"\n```\n\n**Note:** This method doesn't require the `\"management\"` permission and can be run from any extension.\n\n### 3. **Manual Packing Method** (Traditional Approach)\n\n**Initial Pack:**\n1. Go to `chrome://extensions`\n2. Enable Developer mode\n3. Click **Pack extension**\n4. Specify your extension's root directory path\n5. Leave the **Private key file** field empty for first-time packing\n6. Click **Pack extension** - this creates `.crx` and `.pem` files\n7. **Save the `.pem` file securely** - you'll need it for updates\n8. Drag and drop the `.crx` file onto `chrome://extensions` to install\n\n**Testing Permission Updates:**\n1. Add a new permission that triggers warnings to your `manifest.json`\n2. Increase the version number in `manifest.json`\n3. Go to `chrome://extensions` (**don't uninstall the existing extension**)\n4. Click **Pack extension** again, but this time **include the `.pem` file** in the \"Private key file\" field\n5. Drag and drop the new `.crx` file onto the extensions page\n6. You'll see a dialog asking users to accept the new permissions, and the extension will be disabled until approved\n\n## Important Notes:\n\n- **Extension Disabling**: When you add a new permission that triggers warnings, Chrome will automatically disable the extension until the user approves the new permissions\n- **`.crx` Upload Limitation**: Direct `.crx` file uploads have restrictions, which is why the Extension Update Testing Tool is now the recommended approach\n- **No Warning Permissions**: Some permissions like `activeTab` don't trigger warnings, which is a better user experience when possible\n\n## Sources:\n- [Chrome Extension View Optional Permission Warnings Locally - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70890154/chrome-extension-view-optional-permission-warnings-locally)\n- [Permission warning guidelines | Chrome Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/permission-warnings)","timestamp":35337}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Chrome_Extension","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":null,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770548765293,"end":1770548800629,"firstResponse":35337,"sessionCreation":0,"total":35336},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1041","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","output":"Based on my research, here are the **common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026**:\n\n## Common Causes\n\n### 1. **Invalid Go Version Format in go.mod**\nThe most frequent error is specifying Go versions with patch numbers (e.g., `go 1.23.0`) instead of the required format (e.g., `go 1.23`).\n\n**Error message:**\n```\ngo.mod:3: invalid go version '1.23.0': must match format 1.23\n```\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Edit your `go.mod` file and change the version from `go 1.23.0` to `go 1.23`\n- The `go` directive must only include major.minor versions (format: `1.x`), not patch versions\n- Run `go mod tidy` after making the change\n\n### 2. **Multiple Go Versions Installed**\nWhen you have multiple Go versions installed, govulncheck may use a different version than intended. govulncheck uses the `go` command found on your system PATH, which may not match the version used to build govulncheck itself.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- **Option A - Modify PATH:** Temporarily prepend the desired Go version to your PATH:\n  ```bash\n  export PATH=/path/to/go1.24/bin:$PATH\n  govulncheck ./...\n  ```\n\n- **Option B - Use GOTOOLCHAIN (Go 1.21+):** For Go 1.21 and later, use the `GOTOOLCHAIN` environment variable:\n  ```bash\n  go env -w GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.24+auto\n  govulncheck ./...\n  ```\n\n- **Option C - Install specific version:** Download and use a specific Go version:\n  ```bash\n  go install golang.org/dl/go1.24.2@latest\n  go1.24.2 download\n  export PATH=$(go1.24.2 env GOROOT)/bin:$PATH\n  govulncheck ./...\n  ```\n\n### 3. **Go Version Mismatch Between Build and Runtime**\ngovulncheck reports vulnerabilities based on the Go version currently active on your system, not the version used to build govulncheck. This can cause confusion when vulnerabilities are reported for an older Go version that you're not actually using.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Verify your active Go version: `go version`\n- Ensure the `go` command in your PATH points to the intended version\n- Check your environment profile files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `/etc/profile.d/go.sh`)\n- You may need to reload your shell configuration: `source ~/.bashrc` or reboot\n\n### 4. **Stale Environment Configuration**\nSometimes environment variables or shell configurations point to outdated Go installations.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Source your Go configuration files: `source /etc/profile.d/go.sh`\n- Verify GOROOT and GOPATH: `go env GOROOT` and `go env GOPATH`\n- Check which Go binary is being used: `which go`\n- Reboot if necessary to reload all environment settings\n\n## Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Use GOTOOLCHAIN** (available since Go 1.21): This is the modern, recommended approach for managing Go versions\n   ```bash\n   go env -w GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.24+auto\n   ```\n\n2. **Keep go.mod format correct**: Always use `go 1.x` format, never include patch versions\n\n3. **Integrate into CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions or similar to automate govulncheck with consistent Go versions:\n   ```yaml\n   - uses: actions/setup-go@v5\n     with:\n       go-version: '1.24.x'\n   - run: go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest\n   - run: govulncheck ./...\n   ```\n\n4. **Schedule regular scans**: Since vulnerabilities are added to the Go vulnerability database after code is written, run scheduled scans (e.g., weekly) to catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities\n\n5. **Understand govulncheck's behavior**: It performs symbol-level reachability analysis, only reporting vulnerabilities in code paths that are actually used by your application, reducing false positives\n\n## Sources:\n- [How to run govulncheck with a specific Go version? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73709882/how-to-run-govulncheck-with-a-specific-go-version)\n- [x/vuln: govulncheck is confused when go command version doesn't match - GitHub Issue #55045](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/55045)\n- [Fixing the Invalid Go Version Gotcha in go.mod - Medium](https://medium.com/@cndf.dev/fixing-the-invalid-go-version-gotcha-in-go-mod-1dd498c3adcc)\n- [go.mod:3: invalid go version '1.23.0': must match format 1.23 - GitHub Issue #11776](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/11776)\n- [Automating Go Dependency Security with govulncheck in GitHub Actions - Medium](https://medium.com/@vishvadiniravihari/automating-go-dependency-security-with-govulncheck-in-github-actions-1d629d1424c8)","hint":"A good answer must note that govulncheck’s compatibility issues typically stem from mismatches between (a) the Go toolchain version in PATH and the version required by the module/tool (including `go`/`toolchain` directives in `go.mod` and CI settings) and (b) the Go version used to build or run govulncheck, causing errors like “package requires newer Go version” or use of an unavailable toolchain.

It tells iOS how to display your web app when installed on the Home Screen.\n\n### Required Manifest Fields\n\nCreate a `manifest.json` file with these essential fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json.schemastore.org/web-manifest-combined.json\",\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"App\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#E54B4D\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    { \"src\": \"/icon-192x192.png\", \"sizes\": \"192x192\", \"type\": \"image/png\" },\n    { \"src\": \"/icon-256x256.png\", \"sizes\": \"256x256\", \"type\": \"image/png\" },\n    { \"src\": \"/icon-384x384.png\", \"sizes\": \"384x384\", \"type\": \"image/png\" },\n    { \"src\": \"/icon-512x512.png\", \"sizes\": \"512x512\", \"type\": \"image/png\" }\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"?homescreen=1\"\n}\n```\n\n**Critical Fields:**\n- `display`: Must be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` (required for iOS)\n- `start_url`: Entry point when app launches from Home Screen\n- `icons`: Array of PNG icons in multiple sizes (192x192, 256x256, 384x384, 512x512 recommended)\n- `id`: Unique identifier allowing multiple app instances with Focus settings sync\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. Place `manifest.json` in your website's root directory\n2. Add this to the `<head>` section of all HTML pages:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\"/>\n```\n\n## Step 2: Implement Service Worker\n\nCreate a service worker to handle push notifications using the standard Web Push APIs:\n\n- **Push API**: For receiving push messages\n- **Notifications API**: For displaying notifications\n- **Service Worker API**: For background processing\n\nExample service worker (`sw.js`):\n\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  const options = {\n    body: event.data.text(),\n    icon: '/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: '/badge-72x72.png'\n  };\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification('Notification Title', options)\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  event.notification.close();\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow('/')\n  );\n});\n```\n\nRegister the service worker in your main JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => console.log('Service Worker registered'))\n    .catch(error => console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error));\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Request Permission (User-Initiated Only)\n\nPermission requests **must** be triggered by direct user interaction (button click, etc.):\n\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById('subscribe-button').addEventListener('click', async () => {\n  // Check if already added to Home Screen\n  if (!window.navigator.standalone) {\n    // Show instructions to add to Home Screen\n    showAddToHomeScreenInstructions();\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // Request notification permission\n  const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n  \n  if (permission === 'granted') {\n    // Subscribe to push notifications\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY'\n    });\n    \n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Step 4: Guide Users to Add to Home Screen\n\n**This is the most critical step** for iOS. Users must:\n\n1. Visit your website in Safari, Chrome, or Edge on iOS 16.4+\n2. Tap the browser's **Share** button\n3. Select **\"Add to Home Screen\"**\n4. Save the app to their device\n5. **Open the app from the Home Screen** (not from the browser)\n6. Then interact with your subscribe button\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n\nSince this process isn't intuitive, provide clear guidance:\n\n```javascript\n// Detect iOS Safari and show banner\nfunction shouldShowAddToHomeScreen() {\n  const isIOS = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent);\n  const isStandalone = window.navigator.standalone;\n  \n  return isIOS && !isStandalone;\n}\n\nif (shouldShowAddToHomeScreen()) {\n  showAddToHomeScreenBanner();\n}\n```\n\n**Banner should include:**\n- Visual step-by-step instructions with screenshots\n- Clear explanation of the benefits\n- Arrows pointing to the Share button location\n\n## Step 5: Implement Badging API (Optional)\n\niOS 16.4+ supports the Badging API for app icon badges:\n\n```javascript\n// Set badge count\nnavigator.setAppBadge(5);\n\n// Clear badge\nnavigator.clearAppBadge();\n```\n\nBadge permission is granted automatically when notification permission is granted.\n\n## Important iOS-Specific Considerations\n\n### Apple Push Notification Service\n- Uses Apple's APN service (same as native apps)\n- No Apple Developer Program membership required\n- Allow URLs from `*.push.apple.com` in your server configuration\n\n### Focus Integration\n- Notifications integrate with iOS Focus modes\n- Users can configure when to receive notifications per app\n- Focus settings sync across devices using the manifest `id` field\n\n### Browser Support (2025)\n- **Safari**: Full support (iOS 16.4+)\n- **Chrome**: Full support (iOS 16.4+)\n- **Edge**: Full support (iOS 16.4+)\n\n### Notification Characteristics on iOS\n- **Title**: Limited to ~30 characters before truncation\n- **Message**: Limited to 120-150 characters\n- **Rich media**: Not supported (no images, GIFs, videos in notification body)\n- **Icon**: Uses manifest icon, not customizable per notification\n- **Display**: Shows on Lock Screen, Notification Center, and paired Apple Watch\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### Validate Manifest\n1. Check accessibility: `https://yoursite.com/manifest.json`\n2. Use Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest tab\n3. Online validators:\n   - [Manifest Tester](https://manifesttester.com/)\n   - [SimiCart Manifest Generator](https://www.simicart.com/manifest-generator.html/)\n\n### Test End-to-End\n1. Visit your website on iOS 16.4+ device\n2. Tap Share → Add to Home Screen\n3. Save and open from Home Screen (critical!)\n4. Click your subscribe button\n5. Grant permission\n6. Send a test notification\n\n### Re-testing\nTo test again on the same device:\n- Remove the app from Home Screen\n- Clear browser cache (Settings → Safari/Chrome/Edge → Clear cache)\n- Repeat the process\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Permission prompt not appearing | Ensure user accessed via Home Screen app, not browser |\n| Manifest not loading | Verify HTTPS, correct MIME type (`application/manifest+json`), and file path |\n| Icons not displaying | Check icon file accessibility and correct sizes in manifest |\n| Notifications not delivering | Verify service worker is registered and check console for errors |\n\n## Key Differences from Other Platforms\n\n1. **Home Screen requirement**: Unlike Android/Desktop, iOS requires Home Screen installation\n2. **No browser-based notifications**: Notifications only work in Home Screen web apps\n3. **User journey complexity**: Requires explicit multi-step user education\n4. **Limited customization**: No rich media in notifications (yet)\n\n## Sources:\n- [Web Push for Web Apps on iOS and iPadOS | WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/)\n- [Sending web push notifications in web apps and browsers | Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending-web-push-notifications-in-web-apps-and-browsers)\n- [iOS web push setup - OneSignal](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/en/web-push-for-ios)\n- [Setup Web Push Notifications on iOS and iPadOS for Safari - PushAlert](https://pushalert.co/documentation/ios-web-push)","hint":"A correct answer must explain that web push on iOS/iPadOS only works for Safari-installed Home Screen web apps (PWAs) on iOS 16.4+ and must outline the core technical setup: HTTPS PWA with web app manifest and service worker, using the standard Push API/Notification API flow (register service worker, request permission on a user gesture inside the Home Screen app, obtain push subscription, and send via Apple’s Web Push/APNs endpoints) in line with Apple’s 2025/modern documentation.【page2websearch1 page6websearch1 page7websearch1 page9websearch1 page12websearch1 page16websearch1 page18websearch1","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about setting up web push notifications for Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API.","timestamp":56929},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":56929},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SfV4FD1YGZhBwowrwxHQmu","status":"completed","timestamp":56929},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the official Apple documentation and the WebKit blog post for the most accurate information:","timestamp":56929},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":56929},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XVN596scceUi31CEyKD6zJ","status":"completed","timestamp":56929},{"type":"message","content":"Let me also get more specific implementation details from OneSignal and PushAlert documentation:","timestamp":56929},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":56929},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014Es9N5zEDMoH8Jv9RY5Stc","status":"completed","timestamp":56929},{"type":"message","content":"# How to Set Up Web Push Notifications for Web Apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4\n\nBased on the official documentation from Apple WebKit and implementation guides, here's a comprehensive guide to setting up web push notifications for Safari on iOS 16.4+:\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo enable web push notifications on iOS and iPadOS, you need:\n\n- **iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or higher**\n- **HTTPS-enabled website** with a valid SSL certificate\n- **Web Application Manifest** file (`manifest.json`)\n- **Service Worker** for handling push notifications\n- **User must add the web app to their Home Screen** (critical requirement)\n- **User-initiated permission request** (must respond to user interaction)\n\n## Step 1: Create a Web Application Manifest\n\nThe manifest file is **mandatory** for iOS web push.

GitHub Copilot Sign-In Issue (Most Common in 2025-2026)**\n\nThis is a known bug where VS Code fails to open markdown files if GitHub Copilot is prompting for sign-in:\n\n**Solution:**\n- When you see the \"Sign in to use GitHub Copilot\" prompt, **click \"Sign In\"** (even if you have Copilot disabled for markdown files)\n- This fixes the infinite buffering/loading issue with .md files\n- The issue occurs even when Copilot is explicitly disabled for markdown\n\nThis bug was reported in [GitHub Issue #277450](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277450) and has affected many users.\n\n### **2. File Association Not Configured**\n\nIf VS Code treats .md files as plain text:\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Open a .md file in VS Code\n2. Click on the language indicator in the bottom-right corner (it may say \"Plain Text\")\n3. Select **\"Configure File Association for '.md' Files\"**\n4. Choose **\"Markdown\"** from the list\n\n### **3. Extension Conflicts**\n\nMarkdown extensions can sometimes conflict:\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Disable all markdown-related extensions\n2. Restart VS Code\n3. Re-enable extensions one by one to identify the culprit\n4. Keep only the necessary markdown extensions\n\n### **4. Markdown Preview Not Working**\n\nIf files open but preview doesn't work:\n\n**Solution:**\n- Try the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac)\n- Or use Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for \"Markdown: Open Preview\"\n- Check if the built-in markdown extension is enabled in Settings → Extensions\n\n### **5. Reload VS Code Window**\n\nSometimes a simple reload helps:\n\n**Solution:**\n- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)\n- Type \"Reload Window\" and select it\n- This resets the editor without closing VS Code\n\n### **Quick Checklist:**\n1. ✅ Sign in to GitHub Copilot if prompted (even if you don't use it)\n2. ✅ Verify .md file association is set to Markdown\n3. ✅ Disable conflicting extensions\n4. ✅ Reload the VS Code window\n5. ✅ Update to the latest VS Code version\n\nThe GitHub Copilot sign-in issue appears to be the most common cause in recent versions, affecting users even when Copilot is disabled for markdown files.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [GitHub Issue #277450: Markdown files not openable because of GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277450)\n- [Stack Overflow: VSCode .md is not recognize as a markdown file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69839095/vscode-md-is-not-recognize-as-a-markdown-file)\n- [Markdown and Visual Studio Code - Official Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)","hint":"A good answer must mention that VS Code has built‑in Markdown support and explain how to ensure `.md` files are correctly associated with the Markdown editor/preview (e.g., via `workbench.editorAssociations` or “Reopen Editor With…” to set `vscode.markdown.preview.editor` for `*.md`).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about fixing VS Code not opening markdown files in 2026.","timestamp":31215},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":31215},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LjRdQsWnzJi1HjqECsQjUe","status":"completed","timestamp":31215},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more details from the most relevant recent issue about markdown files not opening:","timestamp":31216},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":31216},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0154XzJYxdrCDUbEbvtJRski","status":"completed","timestamp":31216},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more solutions from Stack Overflow:","timestamp":31216},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":31216},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BR3p4TuHu9JRdsvPfGp9MT","status":"completed","timestamp":31216},{"type":"message","content":"## How to Fix VS Code Not Opening Markdown (.md) Files in 2026\n\nBased on recent reports and solutions, here are the main fixes for VS Code not opening markdown files:\n\n### **1.

The issue was reported in December 2025 (version 1.4.5) and appears to be related to session management during OAuth callbacks.\n\n**Note**: There's a discrepancy in your question - you mentioned this is \"from 2026\", but we're currently in February 2026, and the issue was reported in December 2025. The v1.4.10 release was on December 31, 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific fix for the double callback issue, it may be in a different version or still being addressed.

The issue was reported in December 2025 (version 1.4.5) and appears to be related to session management during OAuth callbacks.\n\n**Note**: There's a discrepancy in your question - you mentioned this is \"from 2026\", but we're currently in February 2026, and the issue was reported in December 2025. The v1.4.10 release was on December 31, 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific fix for the double callback issue, it may be in a different version or still being addressed.

This is the recommended approach for 2026:\n\n### 1. Create a New Monorepo Project\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary init\n```\n\nWhen prompted, select **\"Next.js (Monorepo)\"** option. This automatically creates:\n- A monorepo structure with Turborepo as the build system\n- Two workspaces: `apps/web` and `packages/ui`\n- Pre-configured with React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4\n- All necessary configurations set up correctly\n\n### 2. Add Components\n\nNavigate to your app directory and add components:\n\n```bash\ncd apps/web\npnpm dlx shadcn@canary add button\n```\n\nThe CLI automatically:\n- Installs the component to `packages/ui`\n- Configures correct import paths\n- Handles dependencies properly\n\n### 3. Import Components\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from \"@workspace/ui/components/button\"\nimport { useTheme } from \"@workspace/ui/hooks/use-theme\"\nimport { cn } from \"@workspace/ui/lib/utils\"\n```\n\n## File Structure\n\nThe CLI creates this structure:\n\n```\napps\n└── web              # Your app\n    ├── app\n    │   └── page.tsx\n    ├── components\n    ├── components.json\n    └── package.json\npackages\n└── ui               # Shared UI components\n    ├── src\n    │   ├── components\n    │   │   └── button.tsx\n    │   ├── hooks\n    │   ├── lib\n    │   │   └── utils.ts\n    │   └── styles\n    │       └── globals.css\n    ├── components.json\n    └── package.json\n```\n\n## Adding to Existing Turborepo\n\nIf you already have a Turborepo project:\n\n### 1.

Recent research demonstrates that SAE features can be used to identify and control model behaviors, particularly for language steering in multilingual contexts.\n\n### Key Approaches\n\n#### 1. **Causal Language Control via Sparse Feature Steering**\n\nResearch from 2025 (Chou et al., arXiv:2507.13410) shows that:\n\n- **Single feature modification** at one transformer layer can achieve up to **90% success** in controlled language shifts\n- SAE features are trained on **residual streams** of multilingual models (e.g., Gemma-2B, Gemma-9B)\n- Most effective features are identified by analyzing activation differences between English and target languages (Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French)\n- **Mid-to-late transformer layers** provide the most effective steering\n- Specific attention heads are disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features\n\n**Key advantages:**\n- Training-free, inference-time intervention\n- Lightweight and interpretable mechanism\n- Preserves semantic fidelity (measured via LaBSE similarity)\n\n#### 2. **Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS)**\n\nA complementary approach (Pokharel et al., arXiv:2601.16390) focuses on:\n\n- **Selective neuron activation modulation** without training\n- Targets shared vs. language-specific neurons in multilingual representations\n- Achieves **2.3% accuracy** and **3.4% F1 improvements** on average\n- Works through **functional divergence** rather than strict alignment\n- Performance gains correlate with increased language cluster separation\n\n### Practical Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Train or obtain pretrained SAEs:**\n   - Use frameworks like [SAELens](https://github.com/decoderesearch/SAELens) or [Language-Model-SAEs](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Language-Model-SAEs)\n   - Train on residual stream activations from your multilingual model\n\n2. **Identify language-sensitive features:**\n   - Compare SAE feature activations between English and target languages\n   - Focus on features with largest activation differences\n   - Analyze mid-to-late transformer layers (typically layers 12-24 for larger models)\n\n3. **Apply steering at inference time:**\n   - Modify single SAE features during forward pass\n   - No weight updates required\n   - Can combine with attention head analysis for more targeted steering\n\n4. **Validate results:**\n   - Use FastText for language classification\n   - Measure semantic preservation with embedding similarity (e.g., LaBSE)\n   - Test on both classification and generation tasks\n\n### Tools & Resources (2025)\n\n- **[ai-safety-foundation/sparse_autoencoder](https://github.com/ai-safety-foundation/sparse_autoencoder)** -

Performant SAE framework\n- **Anthropic's Scaling Monosemanticity** - Research on extracting interpretable features\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Layer selection matters:** Focus on mid-to-late layers where language representation is most developed\n2. **Feature sparsity is key:** Higher sparsity leads to more interpretable features\n3. **Validate cross-lingually:** Test that steering works bidirectionally across language pairs\n4. **Monitor semantic drift:** Ensure meaning preservation during language steering\n5. **Combine with neuron analysis:** Understanding shared vs. language-specific neurons enhances effectiveness\n\n### Current Limitations\n\n- Most research focuses on high-resource languages\n- Effectiveness varies by model architecture and size\n- Some tasks may require multi-feature steering\n- Limited understanding of feature interaction effects\n\nThis approach represents a significant advancement in interpretable AI, offering lightweight, training-free methods for understanding and controlling multilingual model behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Causal Language Control in Multilingual Transformers via Sparse Feature Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13410)\n- [Cross-Lingual Activation Steering for Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.16390)\n- [SAE-SSV: Supervised Steering in Sparse Representation Spaces](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.16188)\n- [Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/)\n- [GitHub -

You need to ensure your production image includes the runtime environment your application needs.\n\n**Example Fix:**\n```dockerfile\n# Wrong - using bare Ubuntu without runtime\nFROM ubuntu:22.04\n\n# Correct - use appropriate runtime base image\nFROM node:18-slim  # for Node.js apps\n# OR\nFROM golang:1.24-alpine  # for Go apps\n```\n\n### 3. **Add CMD/ENTRYPOINT to Dockerfile**\n\nMake sure your Dockerfile has a proper CMD or ENTRYPOINT directive:\n\n```dockerfile\n# At the end of your Dockerfile\nCMD [\"./main\"]  # for Go binary\n# OR\nCMD [\"node\", \"index.js\"]  # for Node.js\n```\n\n### 4. **For Multi-stage Builds**\n\nIf you're using a multi-stage Dockerfile with a minimal final image like Ubuntu, ensure you either:\n- Use a runtime-appropriate base image (e.g., `node:18-slim` instead of `ubuntu:22.04`)\n- Or install the necessary runtime in the Ubuntu image:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM ubuntu:22.04\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y ca-certificates tzdata && \\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Add CMD directive\nCMD [\"./main\"]\n```\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nRailway tries to execute commands using shell utilities that don't exist in minimal base images.

Load a Decoy DLL**\n- The attacker uses `LoadLibraryEx()` with the `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` flag to load a legitimate Windows DLL (e.g., `amsi.dll`, `pspluginwkr.dll`) into a target process\n- This flag is crucial - it loads the DLL **without calling DllMain()**, avoiding initialization routines that might fail or cause detection\n\n#### **2. Target Selection Criteria**\nThe technique searches for suitable \"sacrificial\" DLLs that meet these requirements:\n- **Not already loaded** in the target process\n- **Not CFG-enabled** (Control Flow Guard disabled) - checked via `IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_GUARD_CF` flag\n- Has a **writable .text section** large enough to hold shellcode\n- Located in legitimate system directories (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32)\n\n#### **3. Memory Allocation via Image Mapping**\nTwo approaches are used:\n\n**A. Module Overloading (2024 Preferred Method):**\n- Uses `NtCreateSection()` with `SEC_IMAGE` + `PAGE_READONLY` flags\n- Uses `NtMapViewOfSection()` to map the DLL\n- Memory is marked as **Image** type (not Private), making it indistinguishable from legitimately loaded DLLs\n- No write permissions needed on the DLL file itself\n\n**B. Traditional LoadLibraryEx:**\n- Simply loads the DLL into memory using `LoadLibraryEx()`\n- Provides base address for subsequent operations\n\n#### **4. Shellcode Injection**\n- Changes memory protection to **RW** using `NtProtectVirtualMemory()`\n- Writes shellcode to one of these locations:\n  - **DLL's AddressOfEntryPoint** (entry point function)\n  - **Beginning of .text section**\n  - **Anywhere within .text section** (more stealthy)\n- Changes protection back to **RX** (Read-Execute)\n\n#### **5. Execution Methods**\n\n**A. Thread Hijacking (Modern 2024 Approach):**\n```cpp\n// Create thread in suspended state\nCreateRemoteThread(..., CREATE_SUSPENDED, ...)\n// Modify thread context to bypass CFG\nctx.Rip = (DWORD_PTR)shellcodeAddress;\nSetThreadContext(hThread, &ctx);\nResumeThread(hThread);\n```\n\n**B. JOP (Jump-Oriented Programming) Chaining:**\n- Creates a chain of legitimate DLL entry points\n- Each DLL's .text section contains: `mov rax, <next_address>; call rax`\n- Final jump leads to shellcode\n- Spoofs thread origin to appear from legitimate DLLs\n\n#### **6. CFG Bypass Techniques (Critical for 2024)**\n\nSince modern Windows has Control Flow Guard enabled, attackers use:\n\n**Option 1: Thread Context Manipulation**\n- Create suspended thread\n- Overwrite RIP register to point directly to shellcode\n- Bypasses CFG validation entirely\n\n**Option 2: NTDLL Patching**\n- Patch `ntdll!LdrpDispatchUserCallTarget` with `stc; nop; nop; nop` (sets carry flag)\n- Forces CFG checks to always pass\n\n**Option 3: Use Non-CFG DLLs**\n- Dynamically find system DLLs compiled without CFG\n- Many older Windows DLLs still lack CFG protection\n\n### **Advantages (Why It's Effective in 2024):**\n\n1. **Stealth:** Memory appears as legitimate DLL, marked as \"Image\" not \"Private\"\n2. **No RWX pages:** Never uses suspicious Read-Write-Execute permissions\n3. **Thread attribution:** Process tools show threads originating from legitimate DLLs\n4. **Evades signatures:** Shellcode hidden inside signed Microsoft DLLs\n5. **Reduced API footprint:** Uses direct syscalls (`NtCreateSection`, `NtMapViewOfSection`)\n\n### **Detection Challenges:**\n\n- Memory contents differ from DLL on disk\n- DLL not listed in PEB (Process Environment Block) module list (unless added)\n- Memory scanning tools like Moneta or hollows_hunter can detect by comparing disk vs. memory\n- Requires runtime memory analysis to detect\n\n### **2024 Enhancements:**\n\n- Dynamic DLL discovery to adapt to different Windows versions\n- Automated CFG detection and bypass selection\n- Integration with syscall direct invocation to avoid EDR hooks\n- Significantly reduced detection rates on VirusTotal (from ~40% to ~10% in tests)\n\nThis technique remains effective in 2024 because it exploits Windows' trust in legitimately signed DLLs and the memory management system's design, while modern bypass techniques handle CFG and other security features.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [DLL Hollowing - SECFORCE Deep Dive](https://www.secforce.com/blog/dll-hollowing-a-deep-dive-into-a-stealthier-memory-allocation-variant/)\n- [DLL Jmping - Black Hills InfoSec](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/dll-jmping/)\n- [Module Stomping - Red Team Notes](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/modulestomping-dll-hollowing-shellcode-injection)\n- [Process Hollowing Techniques - Medium](https://medium.com/@MT0/process-hollowing-and-process-injection-techniques-en-44bd9f8a1b97)","hint":"A good answer must explain that this is a decoy DLL / DLL hollowing or module-stomping style injection that uses LoadLibraryEx to load a benign DLL into a remote or current process, then overwrites or “hollows out” the loaded image’s code (e.g., at its entry point) in memory with malicious payload, and finally transfers execution to that payload to evade detection.

{"id":"websearch-1594","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nwhat are some examples of workers ai binding usage patterns for 2026?","output":"Based on the search results, here are some examples of **Workers AI binding usage patterns for 2026**:\n\n## Basic Configuration\n\nThe Workers AI binding is configured in your `wrangler.toml` or `wrangler.jsonc`:\n\n```toml\n[ai]\nbinding = \"AI\"\n```\n\nThis makes the AI service available as `env.AI` in your Worker code.\n\n## Common Usage Patterns\n\n### 1. **Text Generation with LLMs**\n```typescript\nconst response = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {\n  prompt: \"What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'\",\n  max_tokens: 500\n});\n```\n\n### 2. **Chat Completions with Message History**\n```typescript\nconst response = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {\n  messages: [\n    { role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant.\" },\n    { role: \"user\", content: \"Explain quantum computing\" }\n  ],\n  temperature: 0.7,\n  max_tokens: 1000\n});\n```\n\n### 3. **Streaming Responses**\n```typescript\nconst stream = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {\n  prompt: body.prompt,\n  stream: true,\n  max_tokens: 1000\n});\n\nreturn new Response(stream, {\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',\n    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### 4. **Text Embeddings for Search**\n```typescript\nconst result = await env.AI.run('@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5', {\n  text: doc.content\n});\n// Returns vector embeddings for semantic search\n```\n\n### 5. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**\nCombines embeddings with text generation:\n- Generate embeddings for search queries\n- Find relevant documents using Vectorize\n- Use retrieved context with LLM for answers\n\n### 6. **Image Processing**\n- **Image Classification**: `@cf/microsoft/resnet-50`\n- **Image to Text**: `@cf/unum/uform-gen2-qwen-500m`\n- **Text to Image**: `@cf/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`\n\n### 7. **Speech Processing**\n- **Speech to Text**: `@cf/openai/whisper`\n- **Text to Speech**: `@cf/myshell-ai/melotts`\n\n### 8. **Translation**\n```typescript\nconst result = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/m2m100-1.2b', {\n  text: body.text,\n  source_lang: 'en',\n  target_lang: 'es'\n});\n```\n\n### 9. **Function Calling (Beta)**\nEmbedded function calling allows the AI to use tools and APIs directly\n\n### 10. **LoRA Fine-tuning (Beta)**\nUsing custom LoRA adapters for specialized model behavior\n\n## Best Practices for 2026\n\n- **Choose smaller models** for simple tasks (faster, cheaper)\n- **Implement streaming** for better UX on long generations\n- **Cache common queries** in KV to reduce costs\n- **Set token limits** to prevent runaway costs\n- **Handle errors gracefully** with proper fallbacks\n- **Use rate limiting** to control usage and costs\n\nSources:\n- [Cloudflare Workers AI Bindings Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/)\n- [Workers AI Getting Started

This is a breaking change from SQLAlchemy 1.x behavior.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nIn SQLAlchemy 2.x, the `execute()` method requires its statement argument to be an object in both the `ClauseElement` and `Executable` hierarchies. When you pass a plain string like `\"SELECT 1\"`, SQLAlchemy throws this error:\n\n```\nsqlalchemy.exc.ObjectNotExecutableError: Not an executable object: 'SELECT 1'\n```\n\nThe error occurs because:\n- Plain strings don't have the `_execute_on_connection` attribute that SQLAlchemy 2.x expects\n- While SQLAlchemy 1.4 allowed raw strings (with deprecation warnings), this functionality was completely removed in 2.0\n\n### The Fix: Using text() Wrapper\n\nThe solution is to wrap all raw SQL strings with the `text()` function:\n\n**❌ Old Code (SQLAlchemy 1.x):**\n```python\n# This no longer works in SQLAlchemy 2.x\nsql.execute(\"SELECT id, name FROM item LIMIT 50\")\n```\n\n**✅ New Code (SQLAlchemy 2.x):**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\n# Wrap the SQL string in text()\nsql.execute(text(\"SELECT id, name FROM item LIMIT 50\"))\n```\n\n### Complete Example\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text, create_engine\n\n# For synchronous connections\nengine = create_engine(\"postgresql://user:password@localhost/db\")\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id\"), {\"id\": 1})\n    \n# For async connections\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine\n\nasync_engine = create_async_engine(\"postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/db\")\nasync with async_engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = await conn.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\"))\n```\n\n### Important Notes for 2026\n\n- **All raw SQL must use text()**: You need to wrap every `execute()` statement that uses raw SQL\n- **Works with parameters**: The `text()` wrapper supports bound parameters using `:param_name` syntax\n- **Applies to all operations**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and DDL statements all require `text()` wrapping\n- **No downgrade needed**: Instead of reverting to SQLAlchemy 1.4, simply update your code to use `text()`\n\nThis change improves type safety and makes SQLAlchemy's API more consistent across synchronous and asynchronous operations.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [How to fix sqlalchemy.exc.ObjectNotExecutableError - TechOverflow](https://techoverflow.net/2024/07/06/how-to-fix-sqlalchemy-exc-objectnotexecutableerror-not-an-executable-object/)\n- [ObjectNotExecutableError when executing SQL query using AsyncEngine - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69490450/objectnotexecutableerror-when-executing-any-sql-query-using-asyncengine)","hint":"A good answer must explain that in SQLAlchemy 2.x `ObjectNotExecutableError` occurs because passing a plain SQL string to `Connection.execute()` (or similar) is no longer allowed, as `execute()` now requires an executable construct rather than a bare `str`, and that the fix is to wrap raw SQL in `sqlalchemy.text()` (e.g., `conn.execute(text(\"SELECT ...\"))`) or otherwise use the 2.x-style execution API.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x and the text() wrapper solution.","timestamp":29329},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":29329},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Jpt86DH64Y4PwR2YSLUUZd","status":"completed","timestamp":29329},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":29329},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0161tf7Jp9W3L48kUrxiSend","status":"completed","timestamp":29329},{"type":"message","content":"## What causes ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x?\n\n**ObjectNotExecutableError** occurs in SQLAlchemy 2.x when you try to execute raw SQL strings directly without wrapping them in an executable object.

{"id":"websearch-1641","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","output":"Based on my search results, here's a comprehensive guide on using Figma plugins to create nodes from JSON structures to import designs in 2026:\n\n## How to Use Figma Plugins to Create Nodes from JSON in 2026\n\n### Available Plugins\n\nSeveral plugins can help you import JSON data into Figma designs:\n\n1. **JSON to Figma Import** - Available on the Figma Community\n2. **JSONtoNodeGenerator** - Specifically designed for creating nodes from JSON\n3. **Design Tokens Manager** - Exports/imports Figma Variables and Styles to/from JSON\n4. **Tokens Studio** - Comprehensive design token management with JSON support\n\n### Creating Your Own Plugin\n\nIf you want to build a custom plugin, here's the approach:\n\n#### **Plugin Architecture**\n\nFigma plugins use a two-file structure:\n\n- **ui.html (iframe)**: Handles the UI, user input, and network requests (like fetching JSON)\n- **code.js (sandbox)**: Manipulates Figma layers and creates nodes\n\n#### **Basic Steps to Create Nodes from JSON**\n\n**1. Load JSON Data:**\n```javascript\n// In ui.html\nfetch('your-json-url')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => {\n    // Pass data to sandbox using postMessage\n    parent.postMessage({ \n      pluginMessage: { \n        type: 'createNodes', \n        data: data \n      } \n    }, '*');\n  });\n```\n\n**2. Create Figma Nodes:**\n```javascript\n// In code.js\nfigma.ui.onmessage = msg => {\n  if (msg.type === 'createNodes') {\n    // Create different node types\n    const frame = figma.createFrame();\n    const text = figma.createText();\n    const rectangle = figma.createRectangle();\n    \n    // Populate with JSON data\n    populateNodes(msg.data);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### **Available Node Types**\n\nFigma supports creating these node types programmatically:\n- FrameNode, RectangleNode, EllipseNode\n- TextNode, ComponentNode, InstanceNode\n- GroupNode, SectionNode, and 30+ other types\n\n### Best Practices for 2026\n\n1. **Layer Naming Convention**: Use a prefix (like `#`) to identify data-driven layers (e.g., `#ShowName`, `#Description`)\n\n2. **Handle Images**: Fetch images as blobs and convert to Uint8Array before assigning to nodes:\n```javascript\nfetch(imageUrl)\n  .then(response => response.blob())\n  .then(blob => new Promise((resolve) => {\n    const reader = new FileReader();\n    reader.onload = () => resolve(new Uint8Array(reader.result));\n    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);\n  }));\n```\n\n3. **Recursive Node Traversal**: Navigate through nested structures to populate all layers:\n```javascript\nconst handleText = (dataMap, node) => {\n  if (\"children\" in node) {\n    for (const child of node.children) {\n      handleText(dataMap, child);\n    }\n  } else if (\"characters\" in node) {\n    node.characters = dataMap[node.name];\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### JSON Structure Format\n\nYour JSON should be structured as an array of objects:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Item 1\",\n    \"description\": \"Description text\",\n    \"image\": \"https://example.com/image.jpg\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Resources\n\n- **Official Figma Plugin API Docs**: [figma.com/plugin-docs](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/)\n- **Node Types Reference**: [figma.com/plugin-docs/api/nodes/](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/nodes/)\n- **GitHub Examples**: Search for \"JSON-to-Figma\" repositories for sample code\n\nThe key advantage in 2026 is that these plugins can handle complex nested JSON structures, support multiple data formats (text, images, variables), and integrate with modern design token workflows.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [JSON to Figma Import | Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1396123287818850149/json-to-figma-import)\n- [How to Import JSON into Figma -

What you're looking for is likely **`@vue-js-cron/element-plus`**, which is a Vue 3 cron expression editor component that works with Element Plus UI framework.\n\n## How to Use vue-js-cron with Vue 3 and Element Plus in 2026\n\n### What is vue-js-cron?\n\n`vue-js-cron` is a renderless Vue.js component library that helps you generate and edit cron expressions. It provides pre-built components for various UI frameworks including Element Plus.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **Vue 3** installed in your project\n- **Element Plus** UI framework set up\n- **Vite** as your build tool (standard for Vue 3 projects)\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall the Element Plus-specific package:\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm install @vue-js-cron/element-plus\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn add @vue-js-cron/element-plus\n```\n\n### Setup in Your Vite + Vue 3 Project\n\n**Option 1: Register Globally (in `main.js` or `main.ts`)**\n\n```javascript\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\nimport App from './App.vue'\n\n// Import Element Plus (if not already done)\nimport ElementPlus from 'element-plus'\nimport 'element-plus/dist/index.css'\n\n// Import vue-js-cron for Element Plus\nimport '@vue-js-cron/element-plus/dist/element-plus.css'\nimport CronElementPlusPlugin from '@vue-js-cron/element-plus'\n\nconst app = createApp(App)\n\napp.use(ElementPlus)\napp.use(CronElementPlusPlugin)  // Registers as 'CronElementPlus'\n\napp.mount('#app')\n```\n\n**Option 2: Register Locally (in a specific component)**\n\n```javascript\nimport { CronElementPlus } from '@vue-js-cron/element-plus'\nimport '@vue-js-cron/element-plus/dist/element-plus.css'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    CronElementPlus\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Example\n\nHere's a complete example component:\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <h2>Cron Expression Editor</h2>\n    \n    <cron-element-plus\n      v-model=\"cronExpression\"\n      :button-props=\"{ type: 'primary' }\"\n      @error=\"handleError\" \n    />\n\n    <p class=\"mt-4\">Current cron expression: <strong>{{ cronExpression }}</strong></p>\n    <p v-if=\"error\" class=\"error\">Error: {{ error }}</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      cronExpression: '* * * * *',  // Default: every minute\n      error: ''\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    handleError(err) {\n      this.error = err\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n.error {\n  color: red;\n}\n.mt-4 {\n  margin-top: 1rem;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Composition API Example (Vue 3 Style)\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <cron-element-plus\n      v-model=\"cronExpression\"\n      :button-props=\"{ type: 'primary' }\"\n      @error=\"error = $event\" \n    />\n    \n    <p>Cron: {{ cronExpression }}</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst cronExpression = ref('0 0 * * *')  // Daily at midnight\nconst error = ref('')\n</script>\n```\n\n### Available Props\n\n- **`v-model`**: The cron expression (string)\n- **`button-props`**: Props to pass to Element Plus buttons (e.g., `{ type: 'primary', size: 'large' }`)\n- **`locale`**: Localization (supports multiple languages)\n- **Custom period configurations**: You can customize the available period options\n\n### Other Available Packages\n\nIf you're not using Element Plus, vue-js-cron supports other UI frameworks:\n\n- `@vue-js-cron/core` - Renderless component (no UI)\n- `@vue-js-cron/light` - Lightweight (no external dependencies)\n- `@vue-js-cron/vuetify` - For Vuetify\n- `@vue-js-cron/ant` - For Ant Design Vue\n- `@vue-js-cron/quasar` - For Quasar\n- `@vue-js-cron/naive-ui` - For Naive UI\n- `@vue-js-cron/prime` - For PrimeVue\n\n### Vite Configuration\n\nNo special Vite plugin is needed!

{"id":"websearch-1764","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","output":"Based on my research using the You.com search and content extraction tools, here's a comprehensive guide on how to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026:\n\n## How to Detect and Prevent Proxy Rotation Attacks in E-Commerce Platforms\n\n### **Understanding Proxy Rotation Attacks**\n\nProxy rotation is a technique where attackers continuously switch IP addresses during automated activities like web scraping, credential stuffing, or bypassing anti-bot systems. In e-commerce platforms like Shopee, these attacks can be used for:\n\n- **Price scraping and competitive intelligence theft**\n- **Inventory hoarding and scalping**\n- **Account takeover attempts**\n- **Fake review manipulation**\n- **Payment fraud**\n- **Promotional abuse**\n\n---\n\n## **Detection Methods for 2026**\n\n### **1. Advanced Network Fingerprinting (JA4+)**\n\nModern detection relies on **JA4+ network fingerprinting** techniques that analyze:\n\n- **Packet length** - Maximum Segment Size (MSS) variations\n- **TCP length** - Size of TCP headers in SYN packets\n- **TCP window size** - Amount of data receiver accepts before acknowledgment\n- **Window scale** - Potential increase in window size\n- **Order of TCP options** - Unique sequences (NOP, WScale, MSS, SACK)\n\n**Key Detection Indicators:**\n- Residential proxies often show TCP window size of 65,535\n- Unusual packet lengths (e.g., 1508 bytes vs. typical 1396 for VPNs)\n- Inconsistent fingerprints suggesting multiple routing hops\n\n| **Connection Type** | **Typical Window Size** | **Detectability** |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| Direct User | Varies | Low |\n| Datacenter Proxy | Standard | High (75-85% detection) |\n| Residential Proxy | 65,535 | Medium (60% detection via JA4T) |\n| Mobile Proxy | Varies | Medium-High |\n\n### **2. Device & Browser Fingerprinting**\n\nCollect and analyze **50+ device parameters**:\n\n- **Hardware**: GPU model, CPU cores, RAM, screen resolution\n- **Software**: OS version, browser version, installed fonts\n- **Graphics**: Canvas fingerprinting, WebGL rendering signatures\n- **Network**: WebRTC leaks, timezone inconsistencies\n- **Behavioral**: Mouse movements, typing patterns, scroll behavior\n\n**Detection Logic:**\n- Flag inconsistencies between claimed device type and actual fingerprint\n- Example: User-Agent claims iPhone, but screen resolution is 1920×1080 (desktop)\n- Monitor for constantly changing fingerprints (randomization detection)\n\n### **3. Behavioral Analysis & Machine Learning**\n\nImplement AI-powered behavioral detection:\n\n- **Session characteristics**: Time spent on pages, navigation patterns\n- **Request timing**: Unnatural speed or perfectly regular intervals\n- **Interaction patterns**: Missing mouse movements, no scroll events\n- **Purchase behavior**: Unusual checkout speeds, multiple failed payment attempts\n\n**Success Rate**: Modern ML models can achieve 90-95% accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate users and proxy-based bots.\n\n### **4. IP Reputation & Residential Proxy Detection**\n\nTraditional IP blocklists are less effective in 2026 due to millions of residential IPs. Instead:\n\n- Use **IP quality scoring** services that rate IPs based on:\n  - Known proxy provider associations\n  - Historical abuse patterns\n  - Geolocation consistency checks\n  - Connection type verification (ISP vs. hosting provider)\n\n- Monitor for **geographic anomalies**:\n  - User claims location A but timezone/language suggests location B\n  - Rapid geographic switching within single session\n\n### **5. Connection-Based & Session-Based Access Control**\n\nMove beyond IP-based blocking to:\n\n- **Connection fingerprint analysis** - Detect tunneling and multi-hop routing\n- **Session consistency checks** - Flag sessions with changing device characteristics\n- **Challenge-response tests** - CAPTCHAs, behavioral challenges (mouse movement validation)\n- **Velocity checks** - Rate limiting based on user behavior, not just IP\n\n---\n\n## **Prevention Strategies**\n\n### **1. Multi-Layered Defense Architecture**\n\nImplement a **defense-in-depth approach**:\n\n```\nLayer 1: Network Level\n├─ JA4T fingerprinting at firewall/WAF\n├─ IP reputation filtering\n└─ Geographic access controls\n\nLayer 2: Application Level\n├─ Browser fingerprinting (Canvas, WebGL)\n├─ Device consistency validation\n└─ TLS/SSL fingerprint analysis\n\nLayer 3: Behavioral Level\n├─ Mouse movement & interaction tracking\n├─ Session anomaly detection\n└─ Machine learning classification\n\nLayer 4: Business Logic Level\n├─ Velocity limits (logins, purchases, API calls)\n├─ Transaction risk scoring\n└─ Account relationship mapping\n```\n\n### **2. Advanced Bot Management Solutions**\n\nDeploy specialized e-commerce fraud prevention tools:\n\n- **Device fingerprinting services** (e.g., Fingerprint.com, IPQualityScore)\n- **Bot detection platforms** with residential proxy detection\n- **CAPTCHA alternatives** that analyze user behavior passively\n\n**Recommended Features:**\n- Real-time risk scoring (>90% accuracy)\n- Automated challenge escalation\n- Integration with payment fraud detection\n- Account takeover prevention\n\n### **3. Rate Limiting & Throttling**\n\nImplement intelligent rate limits:\n\n| **Action** | **Limit** | **Detection Threshold** |\n|------------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Login attempts | 5 per 15 min | Flag after 3 failed attempts |\n| Product views | 100 per hour | Flag >200/hour |\n| Add to cart | 20 per 10 min | Flag >30/10min |\n| Purchase attempts | 5 per hour | Flag >10/hour |\n\n**Dynamic throttling**: Increase delays between requests for suspicious sessions.\n\n### **4. Geographic & Temporal Consistency Enforcement**\n\n- **Timezone validation**: Ensure browser timezone matches IP geolocation\n- **Language consistency**: Verify Accept-Language headers match user profile\n- **Access pattern analysis**: Flag logins from impossible travel scenarios\n\n### **5. Enhanced Authentication**\n\nFor high-risk actions:\n- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for account changes\n- **Device binding**: Recognize and trust known devices\n- **Biometric verification**: For mobile apps\n- **Email/SMS verification**: For new device/location access\n\n### **6. Monitoring & Response**\n\nEstablish **Security Operations Center (SOC)** protocols:\n\n- **Real-time dashboards** tracking:\n  - Proxy detection rate\n  - Failed authentication attempts\n  - Geographic distribution anomalies\n  - Success rate of defensive measures\n\n- **Automated response actions**:\n  - Temporary account locks\n  - Step-up authentication challenges\n  - Session termination\n  - IP temporary blocking (with caution for residential IPs)\n\n- **Alert thresholds**:\n  - Error rate >5% from single fingerprint\n  - Response time <2 seconds (too fast for human)\n  - Bandwidth usage >100MB/hour per session\n\n### **7. Session & Cookie Management**\n\n- **Secure session tokens**: Use cryptographically strong, rotating tokens\n- **Cookie fingerprinting**: Track cookie behavior and manipulation\n- **Session binding**: Tie sessions to specific device fingerprints\n- **Idle timeout**: Implement aggressive timeouts for suspicious sessions\n\n---\n\n## **Specific Considerations for Shopee-like Platforms**\n\n### **E-Commerce Specific Threats:**\n\n1. **Flash sale bots**: Detect and block rapid add-to-cart + checkout automation\n2. **Inventory scalpers**: Monitor for mass product reservations\n3. **Review manipulation**: Detect fake accounts posting reviews via proxies\n4. **Promo code abuse**: Track redemption patterns across accounts\n5. **Price scraping**: Rate-limit product page views, obfuscate pricing data\n\n### **Mobile App Protection:**\n\n- **App attestation**: Use SafetyNet (Android) or DeviceCheck (iOS)\n- **Certificate pinning**: Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks\n- **Root/jailbreak detection**: Flag compromised devices\n- **SDK obfuscation**: Make reverse engineering harder\n\n---\n\n## **Future-Proofing for 2026 and Beyond**\n\n### **Emerging Threats:**\n\n- **Modular residential proxies**: Attackers using endpoint-based task execution to bypass fingerprinting\n- **AI-powered bots**: Sophisticated bots that mimic human behavior patterns\n- **Pre-infected IoT devices**: Compromised devices used as proxy endpoints\n\n### **Advanced Countermeasures:**\n\n1. **AI vs. AI defense**: Use machine learning to detect AI-generated traffic patterns\n2. **Blockchain-based verification**: Implement content verification systems\n3. **Zero-trust architecture**: Continuously verify every session, never assume trust\n4. **Collaborative threat intelligence**: Share proxy IP databases across platforms\n\n---\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\n✅ **IP blocking alone is insufficient** -

In e-commerce platforms like Shopee, these attacks can be used for:\n\n- **Price scraping and competitive intelligence theft**\n- **Inventory hoarding and scalping**\n- **Account takeover attempts**\n- **Fake review manipulation**\n- **Payment fraud**\n- **Promotional abuse**\n\n---\n\n## **Detection Methods for 2026**\n\n### **1. Advanced Network Fingerprinting (JA4+)**\n\nModern detection relies on **JA4+ network fingerprinting** techniques that analyze:\n\n- **Packet length** - Maximum Segment Size (MSS) variations\n- **TCP length** - Size of TCP headers in SYN packets\n- **TCP window size** - Amount of data receiver accepts before acknowledgment\n- **Window scale** - Potential increase in window size\n- **Order of TCP options** - Unique sequences (NOP, WScale, MSS, SACK)\n\n**Key Detection Indicators:**\n- Residential proxies often show TCP window size of 65,535\n- Unusual packet lengths (e.g., 1508 bytes vs. typical 1396 for VPNs)\n- Inconsistent fingerprints suggesting multiple routing hops\n\n| **Connection Type** | **Typical Window Size** | **Detectability** |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| Direct User | Varies | Low |\n| Datacenter Proxy | Standard | High (75-85% detection) |\n| Residential Proxy | 65,535 | Medium (60% detection via JA4T) |\n| Mobile Proxy | Varies | Medium-High |\n\n### **2. Device & Browser Fingerprinting**\n\nCollect and analyze **50+ device parameters**:\n\n- **Hardware**: GPU model, CPU cores, RAM, screen resolution\n- **Software**: OS version, browser version, installed fonts\n- **Graphics**: Canvas fingerprinting, WebGL rendering signatures\n- **Network**: WebRTC leaks, timezone inconsistencies\n- **Behavioral**: Mouse movements, typing patterns, scroll behavior\n\n**Detection Logic:**\n- Flag inconsistencies between claimed device type and actual fingerprint\n- Example: User-Agent claims iPhone, but screen resolution is 1920×1080 (desktop)\n- Monitor for constantly changing fingerprints (randomization detection)\n\n### **3. Behavioral Analysis & Machine Learning**\n\nImplement AI-powered behavioral detection:\n\n- **Session characteristics**: Time spent on pages, navigation patterns\n- **Request timing**: Unnatural speed or perfectly regular intervals\n- **Interaction patterns**: Missing mouse movements, no scroll events\n- **Purchase behavior**: Unusual checkout speeds, multiple failed payment attempts\n\n**Success Rate**: Modern ML models can achieve 90-95% accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate users and proxy-based bots.\n\n### **4. IP Reputation & Residential Proxy Detection**\n\nTraditional IP blocklists are less effective in 2026 due to millions of residential IPs. Instead:\n\n- Use **IP quality scoring** services that rate IPs based on:\n  - Known proxy provider associations\n  - Historical abuse patterns\n  - Geolocation consistency checks\n  - Connection type verification (ISP vs. hosting provider)\n\n- Monitor for **geographic anomalies**:\n  - User claims location A but timezone/language suggests location B\n  - Rapid geographic switching within single session\n\n### **5. Connection-Based & Session-Based Access Control**\n\nMove beyond IP-based blocking to:\n\n- **Connection fingerprint analysis** - Detect tunneling and multi-hop routing\n- **Session consistency checks** - Flag sessions with changing device characteristics\n- **Challenge-response tests** - CAPTCHAs, behavioral challenges (mouse movement validation)\n- **Velocity checks** - Rate limiting based on user behavior, not just IP\n\n---\n\n## **Prevention Strategies**\n\n### **1. Multi-Layered Defense Architecture**\n\nImplement a **defense-in-depth approach**:\n\n```\nLayer 1: Network Level\n├─ JA4T fingerprinting at firewall/WAF\n├─ IP reputation filtering\n└─ Geographic access controls\n\nLayer 2: Application Level\n├─ Browser fingerprinting (Canvas, WebGL)\n├─ Device consistency validation\n└─ TLS/SSL fingerprint analysis\n\nLayer 3: Behavioral Level\n├─ Mouse movement & interaction tracking\n├─ Session anomaly detection\n└─ Machine learning classification\n\nLayer 4: Business Logic Level\n├─ Velocity limits (logins, purchases, API calls)\n├─ Transaction risk scoring\n└─ Account relationship mapping\n```\n\n### **2. Advanced Bot Management Solutions**\n\nDeploy specialized e-commerce fraud prevention tools:\n\n- **Device fingerprinting services** (e.g., Fingerprint.com, IPQualityScore)\n- **Bot detection platforms** with residential proxy detection\n- **CAPTCHA alternatives** that analyze user behavior passively\n\n**Recommended Features:**\n- Real-time risk scoring (>90% accuracy)\n- Automated challenge escalation\n- Integration with payment fraud detection\n- Account takeover prevention\n\n### **3. Rate Limiting & Throttling**\n\nImplement intelligent rate limits:\n\n| **Action** | **Limit** | **Detection Threshold** |\n|------------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Login attempts | 5 per 15 min | Flag after 3 failed attempts |\n| Product views | 100 per hour | Flag >200/hour |\n| Add to cart | 20 per 10 min | Flag >30/10min |\n| Purchase attempts | 5 per hour | Flag >10/hour |\n\n**Dynamic throttling**: Increase delays between requests for suspicious sessions.\n\n### **4. Geographic & Temporal Consistency Enforcement**\n\n- **Timezone validation**: Ensure browser timezone matches IP geolocation\n- **Language consistency**: Verify Accept-Language headers match user profile\n- **Access pattern analysis**: Flag logins from impossible travel scenarios\n\n### **5. Enhanced Authentication**\n\nFor high-risk actions:\n- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for account changes\n- **Device binding**: Recognize and trust known devices\n- **Biometric verification**: For mobile apps\n- **Email/SMS verification**: For new device/location access\n\n### **6. Monitoring & Response**\n\nEstablish **Security Operations Center (SOC)** protocols:\n\n- **Real-time dashboards** tracking:\n  - Proxy detection rate\n  - Failed authentication attempts\n  - Geographic distribution anomalies\n  - Success rate of defensive measures\n\n- **Automated response actions**:\n  - Temporary account locks\n  - Step-up authentication challenges\n  - Session termination\n  - IP temporary blocking (with caution for residential IPs)\n\n- **Alert thresholds**:\n  - Error rate >5% from single fingerprint\n  - Response time <2 seconds (too fast for human)\n  - Bandwidth usage >100MB/hour per session\n\n### **7. Session & Cookie Management**\n\n- **Secure session tokens**: Use cryptographically strong, rotating tokens\n- **Cookie fingerprinting**: Track cookie behavior and manipulation\n- **Session binding**: Tie sessions to specific device fingerprints\n- **Idle timeout**: Implement aggressive timeouts for suspicious sessions\n\n---\n\n## **Specific Considerations for Shopee-like Platforms**\n\n### **E-Commerce Specific Threats:**\n\n1. **Flash sale bots**: Detect and block rapid add-to-cart + checkout automation\n2. **Inventory scalpers**: Monitor for mass product reservations\n3. **Review manipulation**: Detect fake accounts posting reviews via proxies\n4. **Promo code abuse**: Track redemption patterns across accounts\n5. **Price scraping**: Rate-limit product page views, obfuscate pricing data\n\n### **Mobile App Protection:**\n\n- **App attestation**: Use SafetyNet (Android) or DeviceCheck (iOS)\n- **Certificate pinning**: Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks\n- **Root/jailbreak detection**: Flag compromised devices\n- **SDK obfuscation**: Make reverse engineering harder\n\n---\n\n## **Future-Proofing for 2026 and Beyond**\n\n### **Emerging Threats:**\n\n- **Modular residential proxies**: Attackers using endpoint-based task execution to bypass fingerprinting\n- **AI-powered bots**: Sophisticated bots that mimic human behavior patterns\n- **Pre-infected IoT devices**: Compromised devices used as proxy endpoints\n\n### **Advanced Countermeasures:**\n\n1. **AI vs. AI defense**: Use machine learning to detect AI-generated traffic patterns\n2. **Blockchain-based verification**: Implement content verification systems\n3. **Zero-trust architecture**: Continuously verify every session, never assume trust\n4. **Collaborative threat intelligence**: Share proxy IP databases across platforms\n\n---\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\n✅ **IP blocking alone is insufficient** - Residential proxies have millions of IPs  \n✅ **Layer multiple detection methods** - Fingerprinting + behavior + ML  \n✅ **Monitor session consistency** - Not just IP reputation  \n✅ **Implement JA4+ fingerprinting** - 60%+ detection rate for residential proxies  \n✅ **Use behavioral analysis** - Mouse movements, timing patterns  \n✅ **Deploy risk-based authentication** - Step-up challenges for suspicious activity  \n✅ **Maintain SOC visibility** - Real-time monitoring and automated responses  \n\n---\n\n## Sources:\n\n- [How Proxy Rotation Helps Bypass Anti-Bot Systems | ScoreDetect Blog](https://www.scoredetect.com/blog/posts/how-proxy-rotation-helps-bypass-anti-bot-systems)\n- [The 10 Best E-Commerce Fraud Prevention Tools in 2026 | Fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com/blog/e-commerce-fraud-prevention-software/)\n- [How to Hide, Spoof, and Stop Browser Fingerprinting in 2026 | Multilogin](https://multilogin.com/blog/how-to-spoof-browser-fingerprint/)\n- [The Rise of Residential Proxies as a Cybercrime Enabler | Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-rise-of-residential-proxies-and-its-impact-on-cyber-risk-exposure-management)\n- [Disrupting the World's Largest Residential Proxy Network | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/disrupting-largest-residential-proxy-network)","timestamp":79156}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Security","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770551504597,"end":1770551583753,"firstResponse":79156,"sessionCreation":0,"total":79156},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1804","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","output":"# How to Set Up a Custom Color Palette for Mobile-First Responsive Design in Tailwind CSS (2024)\n\nBased on the official Tailwind CSS documentation, here's a comprehensive guide to setting up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design:\n\n## 1. Define Custom Colors Using `@theme`\n\nAdd custom colors to your CSS file using the `@theme` directive with the `--color-*` namespace:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  --color-primary-50: oklch(0.984 0.019 200.873);\n  --color-primary-100: oklch(0.956 0.045 203.388);\n  --color-primary-500: oklch(0.715 0.143 215.221);\n  --color-primary-900: oklch(0.398 0.07 227.392);\n  \n  --color-secondary-50: oklch(0.977 0.013 236.62);\n  --color-secondary-500: oklch(0.685 0.169 237.323);\n  --color-secondary-900: oklch(0.391 0.09 240.876);\n  \n  --color-accent: #78dcca;\n  --color-midnight: #121063;\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Use Custom Colors with Utility Classes\n\nOnce defined, your custom colors become available as utility classes:\n\n```html\n<!-- Mobile-first approach: base styles for mobile, then larger screens -->\n<div class=\"bg-primary-50 text-primary-900 \n            md:bg-primary-100 \n            lg:bg-primary-500 lg:text-white\">\n  Mobile-first responsive design\n</div>\n\n<button class=\"bg-accent text-midnight \n               hover:bg-secondary-500\n               md:px-6 md:py-3\n               lg:px-8 lg:py-4\">\n  Call to Action\n</button>\n```\n\n## 3. Override Default Colors\n\nReplace default Tailwind colors by redefining them:\n\n```css\n@theme {\n  --color-gray-50: oklch(0.984 0.003 247.858);\n  --color-gray-100: oklch(0.968 0.007 247.896);\n  --color-gray-500: oklch(0.554 0.046 257.417);\n  /* ... more shades */\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Create a Complete Custom Palette\n\nTo use only your custom colors and remove all defaults:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  --color-*: initial; /* Disable all default colors */\n  \n  --color-white: #fff;\n  --color-black: #000;\n  --color-brand-light: oklch(0.85 0.12 180);\n  --color-brand-main: oklch(0.65 0.18 180);\n  --color-brand-dark: oklch(0.45 0.15 180);\n  --color-accent: oklch(0.75 0.20 45);\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Mobile-First Responsive Breakpoints\n\nCustomize responsive breakpoints for your mobile-first design:\n\n```css\n@theme {\n  --breakpoint-sm: 30rem;   /* 480px - small phones */\n  --breakpoint-md: 48rem;   /* 768px - tablets */\n  --breakpoint-lg: 64rem;   /* 1024px - laptops */\n  --breakpoint-xl: 80rem;   /* 1280px - desktops */\n  --breakpoint-2xl: 96rem;  /* 1536px - large screens */\n}\n```\n\nUse them in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 \n            sm:grid-cols-2 \n            md:grid-cols-3 \n            lg:grid-cols-4 \n            xl:grid-cols-6\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n```\n\n## 6. Adjust Opacity for Colors\n\nApply opacity modifiers to your custom colors:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-primary-500/75 text-accent/90\">\n  <!-- 75% opacity background, 90% opacity text -->\n</div>\n```\n\n## 7. Dark Mode Support\n\nAdd dark mode variants to your mobile-first design:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-primary-50 text-primary-900\n            dark:bg-primary-900 dark:text-primary-50\n            md:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  Responsive with dark mode\n</div>\n```\n\n## 8. Reference Colors in CSS Variables\n\nYour custom colors are available as CSS variables:\n\n```css\n@layer components {\n  .custom-component {\n    background-color: var(--color-primary-500);\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 9. Share Custom Themes Across Projects\n\nCreate a reusable theme file:\n\n```css\n/* theme.css */\n@theme {\n  --color-brand-50: oklch(0.98 0.02 180);\n  --color-brand-500: oklch(0.70 0.15 180);\n  --color-brand-900: oklch(0.40 0.10 180);\n  /* ... more colors */\n}\n```\n\nImport it in your projects:\n\n```css\n/* app.css */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"./theme.css\";\n```\n\n## Key Best Practices for Mobile-First\n\n1. **Define base styles for mobile first** (no breakpoint prefix)\n2. **Layer on complexity** with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.\n3. **Use OKLCH color space** for better perceptual uniformity\n4. **Create color scales** (50-950) for consistency\n5. **Test colors at different screen sizes** and in dark mode\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Tailwind CSS - Colors Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)\n- [Tailwind CSS - Theme Variables Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme)","hint":"A correct answer should explain how to define/extend a custom color palette in Tailwind’s configuration for 2024-era Tailwind (e.g., using `theme.extend.colors` or the v4 `@theme` directive) and then demonstrate using those custom colors via utility classes in a mobile‑first, responsive context (e.g., breakpoint-prefixed classes like `sm:bg-primary-500`, `md:text-brand-700` that build from a base mobile style).","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about setting up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS.","timestamp":34505},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":34505},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Gj9NHpWFHBtJnsd7TfSEeq","status":"completed","timestamp":34505},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed content from the official Tailwind CSS documentation:","timestamp":34505},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":34505},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LXPaCuGyGq2T4x8h17P8aw","status":"completed","timestamp":34505},{"type":"message","content":"# How to Set Up a Custom Color Palette for Mobile-First Responsive Design in Tailwind CSS (2024)\n\nBased on the official Tailwind CSS documentation, here's a comprehensive guide to setting up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design:\n\n## 1.

{"id":"websearch-1806","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","output":"Based on my research, here's how to use the Rust libp2p relay client behavior to dial through the relay API in 2026:\n\n## Using Rust libp2p Relay Client to Dial Through Relay\n\n### Overview\n\nIn libp2p's Circuit Relay v2 protocol, you need to set up both the relay client **behavior** and **transport** to enable dialing through a relay server.\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n#### 1. **Create the Relay Client Transport and Behavior**\n\nFirst, you need to create both the relay transport and behavior together:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::relay::client;\n\n// Create relay transport and behavior\nlet (relay_transport, relay_client_behaviour) = \n    client::new(local_peer_id);\n```\n\n#### 2. **Wrap Your Transport**\n\nThe relay transport needs to be integrated with your existing transport stack:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{Transport, core::upgrade};\n\nlet transport = relay_transport\n    .or_transport(tcp::tokio::Transport::default())\n    // Add other transports as needed\n    .upgrade(upgrade::Version::V1)\n    .authenticate(/* your auth */)\n    .multiplex(/* your muxer */);\n```\n\n#### 3. **Include Relay Client in Your NetworkBehaviour**\n\nAdd the relay client to your custom `NetworkBehaviour`:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::swarm::NetworkBehaviour;\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct MyBehaviour {\n    relay_client: client::Behaviour,\n    // ... other behaviors (identify, kad, etc.)\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Dial Through a Relay**\n\nTo dial a peer through a relay, construct a multiaddr with the `/p2p-circuit` protocol:\n\n```rust\n// Format: /ip4/<relay-ip>/tcp/<port>/p2p/<relay-peer-id>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<destination-peer-id>\nlet relay_address = format!(\n    \"/ip4/{}/tcp/{}/p2p/{}/p2p-circuit/p2p/{}\",\n    relay_ip,\n    relay_port,\n    relay_peer_id,\n    destination_peer_id\n);\n\nswarm.dial(relay_address.parse::<Multiaddr>()?)?;\n```\n\n### Complete Example Pattern\n\n```rust\n// 1. First, dial the relay server directly\nlet relay_addr = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3Koo...\".parse()?;\nswarm.dial(relay_addr.clone())?;\n\n// 2. Wait for identify exchange to complete\n// (Listen for IdentifyEvent::Sent and IdentifyEvent::Received)\n\n// 3. Listen on the relay for incoming connections\nlet relay_listener = relay_addr.with(Protocol::P2pCircuit);\nswarm.listen_on(relay_listener)?;\n\n// 4. Dial other peers through the relay\nlet peer_via_relay = format!(\n    \"{}/p2p-circuit/p2p/{}\",\n    relay_addr,\n    target_peer_id\n);\nswarm.dial(peer_via_relay.parse()?)?;\n```\n\n### Important Events to Handle\n\nMonitor these relay client events:\n\n- `Event::ReservationReqAccepted` - Your reservation on the relay succeeded\n- `Event::ReservationReqFailed` - Your reservation was denied\n- Connection events for the relayed connection establishment\n\n### Key Points for 2026\n\n1. **Circuit Relay v2** is the current standard (v1 is deprecated)\n2. Use the `client::new()` function to create both transport and behavior\n3.

First, dial the relay server directly\nlet relay_addr = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3Koo...\".parse()?;\nswarm.dial(relay_addr.clone())?;\n\n// 2. Wait for identify exchange to complete\n// (Listen for IdentifyEvent::Sent and IdentifyEvent::Received)\n\n// 3. Listen on the relay for incoming connections\nlet relay_listener = relay_addr.with(Protocol::P2pCircuit);\nswarm.listen_on(relay_listener)?;\n\n// 4. Dial other peers through the relay\nlet peer_via_relay = format!(\n    \"{}/p2p-circuit/p2p/{}\",\n    relay_addr,\n    target_peer_id\n);\nswarm.dial(peer_via_relay.parse()?)?;\n```\n\n### Important Events to Handle\n\nMonitor these relay client events:\n\n- `Event::ReservationReqAccepted` - Your reservation on the relay succeeded\n- `Event::ReservationReqFailed` - Your reservation was denied\n- Connection events for the relayed connection establishment\n\n### Key Points for 2026\n\n1. **Circuit Relay v2** is the current standard (v1 is deprecated)\n2. Use the `client::new()` function to create both transport and behavior\n3. The relay client requires the **HOP** protocol (not STOP) - look for `/libp2p/circuit/relay/0.2.0/hop` in identify events\n4. Multiple relay connections are supported and improve availability\n5.

It's a standardized payment protocol that:\n\n- Aggregates multiple payment channels (WeChat Pay, Alipay, bank cards, etc.)\n- Provides unified APIs for order creation, signature verification, and callback handling\n- Uses common fields like `out_trade_no`, `amount`, `subject`, `notify_url`, `return_url`\n- Typically signed with merchant `PID/KEY` using MD5/HMAC/RSA\n\n### Integration with New-API (and One-API)\n\nNew-API (the next-gen fork of One-API) officially supports EPay-style payment gateways. Here's how to configure it:\n\n#### 1. **Required Configuration Fields**\n\nIn New-API's payment settings, you need to configure:\n\n- **API Base URL**: Your YiPay gateway's API endpoint\n- **Merchant ID (PID)**: Your merchant identifier\n- **Merchant Key (KEY)**: Your merchant secret key for signature verification\n\n#### 2. **Configure Payment Methods**\n\nIn the \"Recharge Methods\" section, use this JSON template:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"10\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"自定义1\",\n    \"color\": \"black\",\n    \"type\": \"custom1\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"50\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Field explanations:**\n- `name`: Display label shown to users\n- `color`: Button/badge theme color (CSS color or design token)\n- `type`: Channel identifier (`alipay`, `wxpay`, `custom1`, etc.) - passed to the EPay gateway\n- `min_topup`: Minimum recharge amount for this payment method\n\n#### 3. **Payment Flow**\n\n1. User selects payment method and amount\n2. New-API sends signed request to your EPay gateway\n3. Gateway processes payment through the selected channel\n4. Gateway sends callback to New-API's notify URL\n5. New-API verifies signature and credits user account\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n#### Issue: Balance Shows Zero After Payment\n\nThis is a common problem mentioned in GitHub Issue #900. Possible causes:\n\n1. **Incorrect callback URL configuration**: Make sure your EPay gateway's callback URL points to your New-API instance correctly\n2. **Signature verification failure**: Double-check your Merchant Key matches between EPay and New-API\n3. **Gateway not sending callbacks**: Verify your EPay gateway is configured to send payment notifications\n4. **Firewall/network issues**: Ensure your New-API server can receive incoming callbacks from the EPay gateway\n\n### Alternative Solutions for 2026\n\n#### 1. **Self-Hosted Payment Solutions**\n\n**Three main approaches:**\n\n- **Official channels**: Most stable but requires business registration and physical address\n- **Free sign-free QR code payment**: Less stable, potential security concerns with cracked source codes\n- **Monitored QR code payment**: Requires Windows machine or old phone to monitor WeChat/Alipay, e.g., V免签 (open-source Android client)\n\n#### 2. **KitfoxPay - Payment Adapter Gateway**\n\nA new open-source solution (2026) that addresses EPay limitations:\n\n- **Zero code changes** to New-API\n- Connects New-API to **Jeepay** (open-source payment platform)\n- Provides adapter layer between New-API's EPay interface and Jeepay\n- Supports multiple payment channels through Jeepay\n- Includes web management interface\n\n**Quick setup:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/kitfoxai/kitfoxpay.git\ncd kitfoxpay\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\nThen configure New-API:\n```yaml\npayment:\n  epay_url: http://your-kitfoxpay-domain:9219\n```\n\n### Recommendations for 2026\n\n1. **For small-scale testing**: Use a reliable third-party EPay service provider\n2. **For production with control**: Consider KitfoxPay + Jeepay combination\n3. **For high volume**: Register as individual business owner and use official payment channels (Alipay/WeChat Pay direct integration)\n4. **Always verify**: Test the callback mechanism thoroughly before going live\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n- EPay gateways are NOT licensed payment institutions -

However, it fails to meet a specific requirement in the target criteria: acknowledging the lack of 2026 documentation and suggesting the use of current latest docs. Instead, it presents a speculative or potentially hallucinated tool ('KitfoxPay') and source links as if they were already published in 2026.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":true,"mcpToolCalled":false,"deterministicScore":60,"llmScore":27,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false,"graderLatency":14679.126922999509,"llmLatency":14679.07050599996}}}

{"id":"websearch-1856","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix shetabit/visitor illuminate/support version constraint for laravel 10 11 12 in 2026","output":"Based on my research, I can provide you with comprehensive solutions for fixing the `shetabit/visitor` package's `illuminate/support` version constraint issues for Laravel 10, 11, and 12 in 2026.\n\n## Solutions to Fix shetabit/visitor Version Constraint Issues\n\n### Current Status\nAccording to Packagist, **shetabit/visitor v4.4.2** (released Nov 29, 2025) already supports:\n- `illuminate/support: 9.*|10.*|11.*|12.*`\n\nThis means the latest version officially supports Laravel 10, 11, and 12!\n\n### Solution 1: Update to Latest Version (Recommended)\n\nSimply update the package to the latest version:\n\n```bash\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor\n```\n\nOr require the latest version explicitly:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor:^4.4\n```\n\n### Solution 2: If Composer Still Shows Conflicts\n\nIf you're still experiencing version constraint conflicts, try these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Clear Composer cache**\n```bash\ncomposer clear-cache\n```\n\n**Step 2: Update with dependencies**\n```bash\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor --with-all-dependencies\n```\n\n**Step 3: If using composer.lock, remove it and reinstall**\n```bash\nrm composer.lock\ncomposer install\n```\n\n### Solution 3: Manual Composer.json Constraint Override\n\nIf you need to force compatibility, you can add this to your `composer.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"^4.4\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOr use the `--ignore-platform-reqs` flag temporarily (not recommended for production):\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\n### Solution 4: Use Composer Alias (For Edge Cases)\n\nIf there's a specific version conflict, you can alias the illuminate/support version:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"illuminate/support\": \"^10.0 as 9.0\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Solution 5: Fork or Use an Alternative\n\nIf the official package still doesn't work for your specific setup, you can:\n\n1. **Fork the repository** and modify the `composer.json` constraints yourself\n2. **Check for community forks** on GitHub that may have updated constraints\n3. **Use alternatives** like:\n   - `spatie/laravel-visit` \n   - `cyrildewit/eloquent-viewable`\n   - `awssat/laravel-visits`\n\n### Verification\n\nAfter installation, verify the package works:\n\n```php\n// In your controller or route\nvisitor()->visit();\n\n// Check visitor info\n$browser = visitor()->browser();\n$ip = visitor()->ip();\n```\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe **shetabit/visitor** package **already supports Laravel 10, 11, and 12** as of version 4.4.2. If you're experiencing issues, it's likely due to:\n- Outdated package version\n- Composer cache issues\n- Conflicting dependencies from other packages\n\nRun `composer show shetabit/visitor` to check your installed version and update if needed.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [shetabit/visitor on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/shetabit/visitor)\n- [shetabit/visitor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shetabit/visitor)\n- [Laravel Shift - Can I upgrade Laravel - shetabit/visitor](https://laravelshift.com/can-i-upgrade-laravel/shetabit/visitor)\n- [shetabit/visitor Releases](https://github.com/shetabit/visitor/releases)","hint":"A good answer should explain that `shetabit/visitor` depends on `illuminate/support` and that Laravel already provides `illuminate/support` via `laravel/framework`, so you must adjust or remove any direct `illuminate/support` constraint (or update the package/version constraint) to avoid version conflicts when targeting Laravel 10–12.

If you're experiencing issues, it's likely due to:\n- Outdated package version\n- Composer cache issues\n- Conflicting dependencies from other packages\n\nRun `composer show shetabit/visitor` to check your installed version and update if needed.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [shetabit/visitor on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/shetabit/visitor)\n- [shetabit/visitor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shetabit/visitor)\n- [Laravel Shift - Can I upgrade Laravel - shetabit/visitor](https://laravelshift.com/can-i-upgrade-laravel/shetabit/visitor)\n- [shetabit/visitor Releases](https://github.com/shetabit/visitor/releases)","timestamp":32844}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Laravel_Package","lang":"PHP","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770551998668,"end":1770552031512,"firstResponse":32844,"sessionCreation":1,"total":32844},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.89,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1861","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best embedding models for MLX on Apple Silicon M4 Max as of November 2025?","output":"Based on my research, here are the **best embedding models for MLX on Apple Silicon M4 Max as of November 2025**:\n\n## Top Recommended Models\n\n### 1. **Nomic Embed Text V2**\n- **Architecture**: First MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) embedding model\n- **Size**: 475M parameters (activates only 305M during inference)\n- **Languages**: ~100 languages\n- **Max tokens**: 512\n- **Dimensions**: 768 (can truncate to 256 with Matryoshka learning)\n- **License**: Open-source\n- **Why it's great for M4 Max**: The MoE architecture makes it extremely efficient, only activating a subset of parameters. Strong multilingual performance with competitive results against models 2x its size.\n\n### 2. **BGE-M3** (BAAI General Embedding)\n- **Multi-functionality**: Supports dense, multi-vector, and sparse retrieval simultaneously\n- **Languages**: 100+ languages\n- **Max tokens**: 8192 (excellent for long documents)\n- **Why it's great for M4 Max**: Its multi-granularity support (short sentences to long documents) makes it versatile. The unified memory architecture of M4 Max handles its longer context well.\n\n### 3. **GTE-multilingual-base** (Alibaba)\n- **Size**: 305M parameters\n- **Languages**: 70+ languages\n- **Architecture**: Encoder-only transformer\n- **Why it's great for M4 Max**: Delivers 10x faster inference than decoder-only models. Supports elastic dense embeddings for optimized storage. The encoder-only design is very efficient on Apple Silicon.\n\n### 4. **Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B**\n- **Size**: 600M parameters (also 4B and 8B versions available)\n- **Languages**: 100+ languages (strong in Chinese and English)\n- **Dimensions**: Flexible 32-1024\n- **Instruction-aware**: Supports custom task instructions\n- **Why it's great for M4 Max**: The flexible dimensions let you trade performance for speed. Instruction-awareness can boost performance by 1-5%.\n\n### 5. **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** (Lightweight Option)\n- **Size**: Very small and fast\n- **Dimensions**: 384\n- **Max tokens**: 256 word pieces\n- **Why it's great for M4 Max**: If you need maximum speed on M4 Max, this is one of the fastest options.

Personal override (`~/.factory/AGENTS.md`)\n\n**Core Sections (Recommended):**\n- **Build & Test**: Exact commands for compilation and testing\n- **Architecture Overview**: Major modules and data flow\n- **Security**: API keys, auth flows, sensitive data handling\n- **Git Workflows**: Branching strategy, commit conventions, PR requirements\n- **Conventions & Patterns**: Folder structure, naming patterns, code style\n\n### Factory AI Implementation\n\n**Integration with Specification Mode:**\nFactory's implementation includes a sophisticated workflow:\n1. **Activation**: Press **Shift+Tab** in CLI to enter Specification Mode\n2. **Analysis Phase** (read-only): Examines codebase, reviews AGENTS.md conventions\n3. **Planning Phase**: Develops implementation strategy incorporating AGENTS.md guidelines\n4. **Approval**: User reviews complete plan before any code changes\n5. **Execution**: Systematic implementation following approved specifications\n\n**Enterprise Features:**\n- Automatic spec saving to `.factory/docs` as Markdown files\n- Named format: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`\n- Integration with external platforms (Jira, Confluence, etc.)\n- Multiple autonomy levels for auto-run execution\n\n### Governance\n\nAGENTS.md is stewarded by the **Agentic AI Foundation** under the Linux Foundation (as of 2026), ensuring it remains an open standard. The collaboration includes OpenAI, Factory, Google, Cursor, and other major players in the AI development ecosystem.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Keep it concise**: Aim for ≤150 lines\n- **Use concrete commands**: Wrap commands in backticks\n- **Update alongside code**: Treat as living documentation\n- **Nested files for monorepos**: Each package can have its own AGENTS.md\n\n**Sources:**\n- [AGENTS.md - Factory Documentation](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/agents-md)\n- [Factory joins AGENTS.md collaboration with OpenAI](https://factory.ai/news/agents-md)\n- [Specification Mode - Factory Documentation](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/user-guides/specification-mode)\n- [AGENTS.md Official Site](https://agents.md/)","timestamp":31753}],"metadata":{"category":"Product_Info","subcategory":"Factory","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770552622208,"end":1770552653961,"firstResponse":31753,"sessionCreation":0,"total":31753},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).
