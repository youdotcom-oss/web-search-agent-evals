([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**What’s happening (why UFW is bypassed)**\n- Docker publishes ports using NAT rules, which happens before UFW’s `INPUT/OUTPUT` chains, so UFW doesn’t see that traffic. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recommended fix (works with UFW)**\n1) Put your allow/deny rules in `DOCKER-USER` (filter table), not `FORWARD` or UFW’s `INPUT`.\n   - Docker guarantees `DOCKER-USER` is evaluated before its own chains. ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/firewall-iptables/?utm_source=openai))\n2) If you need to match original destination IP/port (public IP/port), use `conntrack` (because DNAT already happened by the time traffic hits `DOCKER-USER`).

{"id":"websearch-560","input":"How to use Vercel AI SDK streamText for multimodal content and image support in 2026","output":"Here’s the 2026‑ready way to use `streamText` for multimodal (text + image) inputs and image outputs with the Vercel AI SDK, based on current AI SDK docs and Vercel guidance.\n\n**1) Server‑side `streamText` with image inputs (Node/Edge)**\nUse content parts in `messages` and include an image part. The SDK accepts binary data, data URLs, or URLs depending on provider/model. This is the simplest, provider‑agnostic pattern: ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/stream-text-with-image-prompt?utm_source=openai))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport 'dotenv/config';\nimport fs from 'node:fs';\n\nasync function main() {\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: 'user',\n        content: [\n          { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },\n          { type: 'image', image: fs.readFileSync('./data/comic-cat.png') },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n\n  for await (const chunk of result.textStream) {\n    process.stdout.write(chunk);\n  }\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n**2) Next.js + `useChat`: send image parts from the client**\nThe modern pattern is to send `UIMessage` parts and then convert to model messages on the server. The AI SDK handles multimodal parts automatically with `convertToModelMessages`. ([v5.ai-sdk.dev](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/next/stream-text-with-image-prompt?utm_source=openai))\n\nServer route:\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4.1'),\n    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\nClient (simplified):\n- Send `parts` with `{ type: 'text' }` and `{ type: 'image', image: <url|data|file> }`.\n- Or use `useChat` attachments which auto‑convert image files to data URLs. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3) Rendering image outputs from `streamText`**\nSome multimodal LLMs can return images in their responses. The AI SDK exposes them as `file` message parts so you can render them on the client. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot?utm_source=openai))\n\n```tsx\n{message.parts.map((part, i) => {\n  if (part.type === 'text') return <div key={i}>{part.text}</div>;\n  if (part.type === 'file' && part.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {\n    return <img key={i} src={part.url} alt=\"Generated\" />;\n  }\n})}\n```\n\n**4) Enabling image generation with `streamText`**\nVercel’s AI Gateway supports image generation via `streamText` on models that allow multimodal output. The response images show up as content parts/files. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5) Choose a model/provider that supports images**\nNot all providers/models support image inputs/outputs. Use a provider/model documented as multimodal (e.g., Vercel v0 models, Gemini, Claude vision‑capable models, etc.). The AI SDK provider docs call out multimodal support.

This is the simplest, provider‑agnostic pattern: ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/stream-text-with-image-prompt?utm_source=openai))\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport 'dotenv/config';\nimport fs from 'node:fs';\n\nasync function main() {\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: 'user',\n        content: [\n          { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },\n          { type: 'image', image: fs.readFileSync('./data/comic-cat.png') },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n\n  for await (const chunk of result.textStream) {\n    process.stdout.write(chunk);\n  }\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n**2) Next.js + `useChat`: send image parts from the client**\nThe modern pattern is to send `UIMessage` parts and then convert to model messages on the server. The AI SDK handles multimodal parts automatically with `convertToModelMessages`. ([v5.ai-sdk.dev](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/next/stream-text-with-image-prompt?utm_source=openai))\n\nServer route:\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4.1'),\n    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\nClient (simplified):\n- Send `parts` with `{ type: 'text' }` and `{ type: 'image', image: <url|data|file> }`.\n- Or use `useChat` attachments which auto‑convert image files to data URLs. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3) Rendering image outputs from `streamText`**\nSome multimodal LLMs can return images in their responses. The AI SDK exposes them as `file` message parts so you can render them on the client. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot?utm_source=openai))\n\n```tsx\n{message.parts.map((part, i) => {\n  if (part.type === 'text') return <div key={i}>{part.text}</div>;\n  if (part.type === 'file' && part.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {\n    return <img key={i} src={part.url} alt=\"Generated\" />;\n  }\n})}\n```\n\n**4) Enabling image generation with `streamText`**\nVercel’s AI Gateway supports image generation via `streamText` on models that allow multimodal output. The response images show up as content parts/files. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5) Choose a model/provider that supports images**\nNot all providers/models support image inputs/outputs. Use a provider/model documented as multimodal (e.g., Vercel v0 models, Gemini, Claude vision‑capable models, etc.). The AI SDK provider docs call out multimodal support. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/vercel?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n1) your provider/model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Vercel v0, etc.),\n2) whether you’re using Next.js App Router or plain Node,\n3) whether images are URLs or uploads,\nand I’ll tailor a working `streamText` example.","timestamp":32801}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Vercel AI SDK multimodal","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769682519851,"end":1769682552652,"firstResponse":32801,"sessionCreation":0,"total":32801},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

It’s generated from the official OpenAPI spec and supports OAuth 1.0a / OAuth 2.0, pagination, and streaming. ([docs.x.com](https://docs.x.com/x-api/tools-and-libraries/sdks?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Tweepy** — the most popular community library; widely used, good docs, supports v2 and async extras. Great if you want a mature ecosystem and examples. ([docs.x.com](https://docs.x.com/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview?utm_source=openai))  \n- **TwitterAPI / python‑twitter** — simpler wrappers; good for lightweight scripting but tend to expose fewer conveniences. ([docs.x.com](https://docs.x.com/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview?utm_source=openai))  \n- **twarc** — best for collection/archival workflows rather than app‑style posting; excellent for research pipelines. ([docs.x.com](https://docs.x.com/x-api/tools-and-libraries/overview?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIf you strictly need **posting tweets**, the safest 2024 picks are **XDK** (official) or **Tweepy** (community). I recommend:\n\n- **Use XDK** if you want “best future‑proof” and first‑party alignment.

I’ll separate “prompted” bounding‑box detection (Gemini multimodal) from “trained” detection (AutoML/custom), because prompt engineering only applies to the former.\n\n**First choose the right Vertex AI path**\n- **Prompted bounding boxes (Gemini multimodal)**: Use the “Bounding box detection” capability where you send an image + prompt and get boxes in `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` normalized to 0–1000. Best for fast prototyping, ad‑hoc labeling, or human‑in‑the‑loop workflows.

([langchain-ai.lang.chat](https://langchain-ai.lang.chat/langgraph/agents/human-in-the-loop/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Schema (Python, summarized):**  \n- `HumanInterrupt = { action_request, config, description? }`  \n- `HumanResponse = { type: 'accept' | 'ignore' | 'response' | 'edit', args: ... }` ([github.com](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-inbox?utm_source=openai))\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypedDict, Literal, Optional, Union\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n\nclass HumanInterruptConfig(TypedDict):\n    allow_ignore: bool\n    allow_respond: bool\n    allow_edit: bool\n    allow_accept: bool\n\nclass ActionRequest(TypedDict):\n    action: str\n    args: dict\n\nclass HumanInterrupt(TypedDict):\n    action_request: ActionRequest\n    config: HumanInterruptConfig\n    description: Optional[str]\n\nclass HumanResponse(TypedDict):\n    type: Literal[\"accept\", \"ignore\", \"response\", \"edit\"]\n    args: Union[None, str, ActionRequest]\n\ndef tool_with_hitl(state):\n    request: HumanInterrupt = {\n        \"action_request\": {\"action\": \"send_email\", \"args\": {\"to\": \"a@b.com\"}},\n        \"config\": {\n            \"allow_ignore\": True,\n            \"allow_respond\": True,\n            \"allow_edit\": True,\n            \"allow_accept\": True,\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Approve or edit the email draft.\"\n    }\n\n    responses: list[HumanResponse] = interrupt([request])\n    # Agent Inbox responds with a list\n    decision = responses[0]\n    return {\"decision\": decision}\n\n# Later, resume with user choice:\n# graph.invoke(Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"accept\"}]), config)\n# graph.invoke(Command(resume=[{\"type\": \"edit\", \"args\": {\"action\": \"send_email\", \"args\": {\"to\": \"c@d.com\"}}}]), config)\n```\n\n---\n\n**3) Common pitfalls (2026 behavior)**\n\n- **Resumption restarts the node** from the top; if you do external side effects before `interrupt`, guard them. ([reference.langchain.com](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **`thread_id` must be the same** to resume the correct checkpoint. ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Payload must be JSON‑serializable** for interrupts/resume. ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/human-in-the-loop?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me your exact LangGraph version or the UI you’re integrating (Agent Inbox, LangGraph Platform, custom), and I can tailor the snippet to that environment.","timestamp":28218}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"LangGraph","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769683746439,"end":1769683774657,"firstResponse":28218,"sessionCreation":0,"total":28218},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1041","input":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","output":"Here are the most common Go version compatibility errors you’ll see with `govulncheck` in 2026, why they happen, and how to fix them. (I’m using the current Go tooling rules and the current `x/vuln` module requirements.)\n\nCommon causes and fixes\n\n1) Your Go toolchain is older than `govulncheck`’s required Go version  \n- Why it happens: `govulncheck` is built from `golang.org/x/vuln`, and that module currently declares `go 1.24.0`. If you run `go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest` with an older toolchain, the go command refuses to load the module. ([go.googlesource.com](https://go.googlesource.com/vuln/%2B/774cde5e03be6cddba74dbeda8a3809e0f4497da/go.mod?utm_source=openai))  \n- Fix: Upgrade your Go toolchain to at least the version required by `x/vuln` (currently 1.24.0), then reinstall `govulncheck`. If you cannot upgrade, install a tagged `govulncheck` version whose `go.mod` declares a compatible Go version (check the tag’s `go.mod` before installing). The “go line must not exceed the toolchain” rule is enforced by the Go toolchain. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n\n2) Your module/workspace `go` or `toolchain` line requires a newer Go than the one running `govulncheck`  \n- Why it happens: The Go toolchain refuses to load a module or workspace if its `go` line declares a version higher than the running toolchain. With Go 1.21+ this is strict, and there are backports that also enforce newer limits. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n- Fix: Either run `govulncheck` with a newer Go toolchain that satisfies the `go`/`toolchain` line, or lower the `go` line only if your code and dependencies truly remain compatible. If you’re on 1.21+, the strict requirement is expected behavior. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3) A dependency requires a newer Go version than your module declares  \n- Why it happens: The `go` line in your module must be ≥ the `go` line of each required dependency. If a dependency bumps its `go` line, older toolchains or older `go` lines in your module cause load errors. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n- Fix: Update your module’s `go` line and use a matching/newer toolchain, or pin the dependency to a version compatible with your current Go. The rule is enforced by the Go toolchain. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n\n4) CI or GitHub Action forces a different Go version than your `go.mod` expects  \n- Why it happens: The `govulncheck-action` can be configured with either `go-version` or `go-version-file`. If both are set, the action warns and prefers `go-version`, which may differ from your `go.mod`. That can produce compatibility errors in CI even if local runs are fine. ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/70036?utm_source=openai))  \n- Fix: Use only one input. Prefer `go-version-file: go.mod` so CI matches your module’s `go` line. ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/70036?utm_source=openai))  \n\n5) Using older tooling that doesn’t understand `toolchain` lines (or mismatches toolchain auto‑selection)  \n- Why it happens: The Go toolchain now uses `go` + `toolchain` lines to select an appropriate toolchain version. Older tooling or containers can fail when they see a `toolchain` directive, or they may be stuck on an older Go version. The official toolchain docs describe how `go` and `toolchain` lines control selection and minimum versions. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n- Fix: Update the Go toolchain used by the scanner/container, or remove `toolchain` lines only if your environment truly can’t handle them (not recommended). If you rely on auto toolchain selection, ensure it can download and use the required toolchain. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n\nQuick checks (fast triage)\n\n- `govulncheck -version` to confirm the Go version it’s running with.  \n- `go env GOTOOLCHAIN` to see if auto toolchain switching is on, and whether it can fetch newer toolchains. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n- Inspect your `go.mod` / `go.work` for `go` and `toolchain` lines. If they’re higher than your installed Go, that’s the root cause. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))  \n- If installing `govulncheck@latest` fails, check the `go` line in `golang.org/x/vuln` (currently `go 1.24.0`). ([go.googlesource.com](https://go.googlesource.com/vuln/%2B/774cde5e03be6cddba74dbeda8a3809e0f4497da/go.mod?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIf you can share the exact error text (and your `go env` / `govulncheck -version` output), I can map it to the precise fix.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Here are the most common Go version compatibility errors you’ll see with `govulncheck` in 2026, why they happen, and how to fix them.

([deepwiki.com](https://deepwiki.com/getzep/graphiti/5.2-edge-operations?utm_source=openai))  \n- The model itself is defined in `graphiti_core/prompts/extract_nodes.py` as `ExtractedEntity` and `ExtractedEntities`.

([docs.rs](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/struct.Transport.html))\n\n**Using this in a `Swarm`**\n- Add the `relay::client::Behaviour` into your `NetworkBehaviour` (e.g., via a custom struct or `libp2p::swarm::behaviour::Either`).\n- When dialing, pass the relayed multiaddr into `swarm.dial(...)` instead of calling `transport.dial(...)`. The transport will recognize `/p2p-circuit` and route through the relay. ([docs.rs](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/struct.Transport.html))\n\n**If you also want inbound relayed connections**\n- You can `listen_on` a relay address ending with `/p2p-circuit` to accept inbound relayed connections via that relay. ([docs.rs](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/struct.Transport.html))\n\nIf you want, tell me which libp2p version and transport stack you’re using (tcp/quic/webrtc), and I’ll tailor a full Swarm example for that exact setup.","timestamp":32072}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Libp2p_Rust","lang":"Rust","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769686806104,"end":1769686838176,"firstResponse":32072,"sessionCreation":0,"total":32072},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

LiveKit’s MCP support is Python‑only and expects you to load MCP tools via `mcp.MCPServerHTTP` in `AgentSession` or `Agent`. Make sure you’re actually using that and have the MCP extras installed.

If your MCP server upgraded to streamable HTTP (2025‑03‑26), make sure your client uses the HTTP transport and a compatible endpoint.

LiveKit lets you configure custom MCP headers (e.g., `Authorization`).
