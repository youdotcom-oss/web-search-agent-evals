enforce row/table locking) and how they fit within broader database concurrency control, and (b) point to or reasonably characterize any relevant recent (around 2024–2025) research or technical

Create a Webhook Endpoint\n\nCreate a webhook endpoint at `app/api/webhooks/route.ts` (for Next.js):\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks';\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    // Verify the webhook signature\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req);\n    \n    const eventType = evt.type;\n    \n    switch (eventType) {\n      case 'organization.created':\n        const { id, name, slug, created_at } = evt.data;\n        // Handle organization creation\n        // e.g., Create organization in your database\n        console.log(`Organization created: ${name} (${id})`);\n        await createOrganizationInDB({ id, name, slug, created_at });\n        break;\n        \n      case 'organization.updated':\n        const updatedOrg = evt.data;\n        // Handle organization update\n        // e.g., Update organization in your database\n        console.log(`Organization updated: ${updatedOrg.name}`);\n        await updateOrganizationInDB(updatedOrg);\n        break;\n        \n      case 'organization.deleted':\n        const deletedOrgId = evt.data.id;\n        // Handle organization deletion\n        // e.g., Delete or soft-delete organization in your database\n        console.log(`Organization deleted: ${deletedOrgId}`);\n        await deleteOrganizationFromDB(deletedOrgId);\n        break;\n        \n      default:\n        console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${eventType}`);\n    }\n    \n    // Return 200 immediately to acknowledge receipt\n    return NextResponse.json({ received: true }, { status: 200 });\n    \n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Webhook error:', err);\n    return NextResponse.json(\n      { error: 'Webhook verification failed' },\n      { status: 400 }\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Go to the **Clerk Dashboard** → **Webhooks**\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your webhook URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks`)\n4. Select the events to subscribe to:\n   - `organization.created`\n   - `organization.updated`\n   - `organization.deleted`\n5.

Create a Webhook Endpoint\n\nCreate a webhook endpoint at `app/api/webhooks/route.ts` (for Next.js):\n\n```typescript\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks';\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    // Verify the webhook signature\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req);\n    \n    const eventType = evt.type;\n    \n    switch (eventType) {\n      case 'organization.created':\n        const { id, name, slug, created_at } = evt.data;\n        // Handle organization creation\n        // e.g., Create organization in your database\n        console.log(`Organization created: ${name} (${id})`);\n        await createOrganizationInDB({ id, name, slug, created_at });\n        break;\n        \n      case 'organization.updated':\n        const updatedOrg = evt.data;\n        // Handle organization update\n        // e.g., Update organization in your database\n        console.log(`Organization updated: ${updatedOrg.name}`);\n        await updateOrganizationInDB(updatedOrg);\n        break;\n        \n      case 'organization.deleted':\n        const deletedOrgId = evt.data.id;\n        // Handle organization deletion\n        // e.g., Delete or soft-delete organization in your database\n        console.log(`Organization deleted: ${deletedOrgId}`);\n        await deleteOrganizationFromDB(deletedOrgId);\n        break;\n        \n      default:\n        console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${eventType}`);\n    }\n    \n    // Return 200 immediately to acknowledge receipt\n    return NextResponse.json({ received: true }, { status: 200 });\n    \n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Webhook error:', err);\n    return NextResponse.json(\n      { error: 'Webhook verification failed' },\n      { status: 400 }\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Go to the **Clerk Dashboard** → **Webhooks**\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your webhook URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks`)\n4. Select the events to subscribe to:\n   - `organization.created`\n   - `organization.updated`\n   - `organization.deleted`\n5.

This tells shadcn/ui to configure itself for a monorepo structure.\n\n### Step 4: Configure the UI Package\n\nNavigate to `packages/ui` and set up the following:\n\n#### 4.1 Install Tailwind CSS Dependencies\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss\n```\n\n#### 4.2 Create PostCSS Configuration\n\nCreate `packages/ui/postcss.config.js`:\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\n#### 4.3 Create Global Styles\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/globals.css`:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n/* shadcn/ui CSS variables will be added here after init */\n```\n\n#### 4.4 Set Up TypeScript Path Aliases\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/tsconfig.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@ui/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Create `components.json` in UI Package\n\nCreate `packages/ui/components.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"\",\n    \"css\": \"src/globals.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"neutral\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@ui/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@ui/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@ui/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@ui/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@ui/hooks\"\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Add shadcn/ui Components\n\nFrom the **root of your monorepo** or the **packages/ui directory**, add components:\n\n```bash\n# Add a button component\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\n\n# Add multiple components\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card dialog input\n```\n\n### Step 7: Export Components from UI Package\n\nUpdate `packages/ui/package.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./src/globals.css\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/ui/*.tsx\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate an index export file `packages/ui/src/index.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Export all components\nexport * from './components/ui/button';\nexport * from './components/ui/card';\n// Add more exports as you add components\n\n// Export utilities\nexport { cn } from './lib/utils';\n```\n\n### Step 8: Use Components in Your Apps\n\nIn your Next.js app (`apps/web`):\n\n#### 8.1 Import Global Styles\n\nIn `apps/web/app/globals.css` or `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`:\n```typescript\nimport '@repo/ui/globals.css';\n```\n\n#### 8.2 Use Components\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from '@repo/ui/components/button';\n// Or if using the index export:\nimport { Button } from '@repo/ui';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Button variant=\"default\">Click me</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Step 9: Configure Tailwind in Your Apps\n\nMake sure your apps are configured to scan the UI package for Tailwind classes.\n\nIn `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  content: [\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    '../../packages/ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', // Include shared UI package\n  ],\n  // ... rest of config\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Commands\n\n| Action | Command |\n|--------|---------|\n| Initialize shadcn/ui | `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init` |\n| Add component | `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]` |\n| List available components | `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add` |\n| Update components | `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest diff` |\n\n---\n\n## Key Tips for 2026\n\n1. **Use the `@latest` or `@canary` tag** - shadcn/ui has improved monorepo support in recent versions\n2. **Select \"monorepo\" during init** - This is crucial for proper configuration\n3. **Use Bun or pnpm** - Better monorepo support and faster installs\n4. **Leverage Turborepo caching** - Your UI package builds will be cached\n5. **Keep `components.json` in your UI package** - This tells shadcn where to install components\n\n---\n\n## Official Resources\n\n- **shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo\n- **Turborepo shadcn Guide**: https://turborepo.dev/docs/guides/tools/shadcn-ui\n\nThis setup allows you to share shadcn/ui components across multiple apps in your Turborepo while maintaining a single source of truth for your UI library.","hint":"A correct answer must explain how to initialize and configure shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo, including using the shadcn CLI with monorepo support, creating or using a shared `ui` (or similar) package, wiring Tailwind CSS/config so the shared components work across apps, and importing/using those components from individual app workspaces.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":71408},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":71408},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GRTsKhkwsVeC6DoB5CQrMr","status":"completed","timestamp":71408},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to set up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo monorepo in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up shadcn/ui in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026 Tutorial)\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Turborepo Project\n\n```bash\n# Using Bun (recommended)\nbunx create-turbo@latest\n\n# Or using pnpm\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest\n\n# Or using npm\nnpx create-turbo@latest\n```\n\nWhen prompted:\n- Choose your project name\n- Select your package manager (Bun or pnpm recommended)\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Project Structure\n\nYour Turborepo will have this structure:\n```\nmy-turborepo/\n├── apps/\n│   ├── web/          # Next.js app\n│   └── docs/         # Another app (optional)\n├── packages/\n│   ├── ui/           # Shared UI components (shadcn goes here)\n│   ├── config-eslint/\n│   └── config-typescript/\n├── package.json\n└── turbo.json\n```\n\n### Step 3: Initialize shadcn/ui for Monorepo\n\nNavigate to your project root and run:\n\n```bash\n# Using pnpm\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using Bun\nbunx shadcn@latest init\n\n# Using npm\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\n**Important:** When prompted, select the **\"monorepo\"** option.

{"id":"websearch-1470","input":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","output":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026\n## React Checkbox onClick Handling Best Practices (2026)\n\nBased on my research, here are the current best practices for handling React onClick interactions with checkbox labels and inputs:\n\n### 1. Use `onChange` Instead of `onClick`\nFor checkboxes, prefer the `onChange` event handler over `onClick`. This is the standard pattern that works correctly with both the input and its label:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction CheckboxExample() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input \n        type=\"checkbox\" \n        checked={isChecked} \n        onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)} \n      />\n      Subscribe to updates\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Link Labels Properly with `htmlFor`\nIn React, use `htmlFor` (not `for`) to associate labels with checkboxes. This ensures clicking the label toggles the checkbox:\n\n```jsx\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"myCheckbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n<label htmlFor=\"myCheckbox\">Click me to toggle</label>\n```\n\n### 3. Controlled Components Pattern\nAlways use controlled components where the checkbox state is managed by React state:\n\n```jsx\nconst [preferences, setPreferences] = useState({\n  newsletter: false,\n  notifications: false\n});\n\nconst handlePreferenceChange = (key) => {\n  setPreferences(prev => ({ ...prev, [key]: !prev[key] }));\n};\n\nreturn (\n  <label>\n    <input \n      type=\"checkbox\" \n      checked={preferences.newsletter} \n      onChange={() => handlePreferenceChange('newsletter')} \n    />\n    Newsletter\n  </label>\n);\n```\n\n### 4. Wrap Input Inside Label (Simplest Approach)\nWrapping the input inside the label element automatically links them without needing `htmlFor`/`id`:\n\n```jsx\n<label>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={checked} onChange={handleChange} />\n  <span>Label text</span>\n</label>\n```\n\n### 5. Accessibility Considerations\n- Always provide meaningful labels\n- Use proper semantic HTML (`<label>`, `htmlFor`)\n- For custom-styled checkboxes, ensure keyboard navigation works\n- Hidden inputs should still be accessible to screen readers\n\n### When to Use `onClick` on Labels\nIf you need custom behavior beyond toggling (like analytics tracking), you can add `onClick` to the label, but be aware it will fire alongside the input's `onChange`:\n\n```jsx\n<label onClick={() => trackAnalytics('checkbox-clicked')}>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={checked} onChange={handleChange} />\n  Track me\n</label>\n```\n\n### Summary\n- **Use `onChange`** on checkbox inputs (not `onClick`)\n- **Use `htmlFor`** in React (equivalent to HTML's `for` attribute)\n- **Controlled components** are the recommended pattern\n- **Wrapping inputs in labels** is the cleanest approach for linking them","hint":"A strong answer should explain that in modern React you normally handle checkbox interaction with a controlled component using the `checked` prop and `onChange` (not `onClick`) on the `<input type=\"checkbox\">`, and use a `<label>` correctly associated via `htmlFor`/`id` (or wrapping the input) so clicks on the label toggle the checkbox while preserving keyboard and screen‑reader accessibility.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","timestamp":47196},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":47196},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019JnJYKSfQW2Xk2fsncmLzW","status":"completed","timestamp":47196},{"type":"message","content":"## React Checkbox onClick Handling Best Practices (2026)\n\nBased on my research, here are the current best practices for handling React onClick interactions with checkbox labels and inputs:\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1548","input":"how does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","output":"how does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024\nBased on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive explanation of how LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing (also known as Module Stomping or DLL Hollowing) process injection works.\n\n## LoadLibraryEx Decoy DLL Memory Hollowing Process Injection (2024)\n\n### Overview\n\nThis technique is a stealthy form of process injection where an attacker loads a legitimate DLL into a process and then overwrites portions of that DLL's memory with malicious shellcode. The key innovation is using **`LoadLibraryEx`** with the **`DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES`** flag (value `0x00000001`) to load the DLL without executing its `DllMain` function.\n\n### How It Works (Step-by-Step)\n\n#### 1. **Target Process Selection**\n- Create a new process (e.g., `notepad.exe`) or open a handle to an existing process\n- The process can be started in a suspended state for more control\n- PPID (Parent Process ID) spoofing can be used to make the process appear to have a legitimate parent\n\n#### 2. **Decoy DLL Loading with LoadLibraryEx**\nThe critical step uses `LoadLibraryEx` with special flags:\n\n```c\nHMODULE hTargetDLL = LoadLibraryEx(dllName, NULL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES);\n```\n\n**Why `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES`?**\n- Loads the DLL into memory **without** calling `DllMain`\n- Prevents `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` and `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH` events from firing\n- Avoids triggering the shellcode multiple times if writing to the entry point\n- Bypasses some security monitoring that hooks DLL initialization\n\n#### 3. **Finding the Injection Point**\nParse the DLL's PE headers to locate the entry point:\n\n```c\nPIMAGE_DOS_HEADER mzHeader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)hTargetDLL;\nPIMAGE_NT_HEADERS peHeader = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((char*)hTargetDLL + mzHeader->e_lfanew);\nvoid* entryPointDLL = (void*)((char*)hTargetDLL + peHeader->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);\n```\n\nAlternative injection points include:\n- The `.text` section start address\n- Exported function addresses (e.g., `DllCanUnloadNow`)\n\n#### 4. **Memory Permission Modification**\nChange the target memory region to be writable:\n\n```c\nVirtualProtect(entryPointDLL, shellcode_size, PAGE_READWRITE, &oldProtect);\n```\n\n#### 5. **Shellcode Injection**\nOverwrite the DLL's entry point or `.text` section with malicious code:\n\n```c\nmemcpy(entryPointDLL, shellcode, shellcode_size);\n```\n\n#### 6. **Restore Permissions & Execute**\n```c\nVirtualProtect(entryPointDLL, shellcode_size, oldProtect, &oldProtect);\nCreateThread(0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)entryPointDLL, NULL, 0, 0);\n```\n\n### Remote Process Variant (More Advanced)\n\nFor injecting into a remote process, additional steps are required:\n\n1. **Create a \"shim\" shellcode** that calls `LoadLibraryExA` with `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES`\n2. **Inject the shim** into the remote process using `VirtualAllocEx` + `WriteProcessMemory`\n3. **Execute the shim** via `CreateRemoteThread` to load the decoy DLL\n4. **Enumerate remote modules** to find the loaded DLL's base address\n5. **Read and parse** the remote DLL's PE headers\n6. **Write shellcode** to the remote DLL's entry point\n7. **Execute** via `CreateRemoteThread` or `QueueUserAPC`\n\n### 2024 Evasion Techniques\n\nModern implementations include several evasion improvements:\n\n| Technique | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **DLL Jmping/Chaining** | Write JMP trampolines across multiple non-CFG DLLs to obscure thread origin |\n| **CFG Bypass** | Locate DLLs without Control Flow Guard enabled |\n| **Thread Origin Spoofing** | Make thread start address appear to be from legitimate DLL |\n| **PPID Spoofing** | Make injector process appear to have legitimate parent |\n| **Memory Cleanup** | `VirtualFreeEx` to remove loader artifacts |\n| **Syscall Usage** | Replace PInvoke with direct syscalls to avoid hooks |\n\n### DLL Selection Criteria\n\nAttackers choose DLLs based on:\n- **Size**: Must be large enough to hold the shellcode\n- **No CFG**: Compiled without Control Flow Guard (`IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_GUARD_CF`)\n- **Not already loaded**: To avoid conflicts\n- **Appears legitimate**: System DLLs like `amsi.dll`, `xpsservices.dll` blend in\n\n### Detection & Defense (2024)\n\nSecurity researchers have developed detection methods including:\n- **ETW (Event Tracing for Windows)** monitoring for `LoadLibrary` followed by memory writes\n- **Memory region analysis**: Detecting executable code in DLL regions that differs from disk\n- **Thread origin verification**: Checking if thread start addresses match expected DLL code\n- **Detection accuracy**: Modern approaches achieve 99.93% accuracy with 0.068% false positive rate\n\n### Why This Technique Is Effective\n\n1. **Legitimate appearance**: The loaded DLL is a real Microsoft-signed binary\n2. **Memory-backed**: No malicious file on disk to scan\n3. **Blends in**: Process has expected DLLs loaded\n4. **Avoids DllMain hooks**: `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` skips initialization monitoring\n5. **Thread masquerading**: Thread appears to originate from legitimate DLL code","hint":"A good answer must explain that this is a decoy DLL / DLL hollowing or module-stomping style injection that uses LoadLibraryEx to load a benign DLL into a remote or current process, then overwrites or “hollows out” the loaded image’s code (e.g., at its entry point) in memory with malicious payload, and finally transfers execution to that payload to evade detection. It should mention the relationship to process hollowing/memory hollowing techniques (legitimate container process or module, unmapping/overwriting sections, and executing attacker code from that disguised region) and, if referencing 2024, note that it is a contemporary variant/usage rather than a deprecated or purely historical method.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","timestamp":106246},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":106246},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XpWr1WqGnaBWR39B6xncS6","status":"completed","timestamp":106246},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":106246},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PgxUNd9GmReXJUMFtXBvp1","status":"completed","timestamp":106246},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SDRytmspZxpRzQmLPsoTUe","status":"completed","timestamp":106246},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VoWZV83VSpVoUA9ep78Tzs","status":"completed","timestamp":106246},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014qUE2zFWb9fKYKX5gLTBQu","status":"completed","timestamp":106246},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive explanation of how LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing (also known as Module Stomping or DLL Hollowing) process injection works.\n\n## LoadLibraryEx Decoy DLL Memory Hollowing Process Injection (2024)\n\n### Overview\n\nThis technique is a stealthy form of process injection where an attacker loads a legitimate DLL into a process and then overwrites portions of that DLL's memory with malicious shellcode.

Add Dependencies\n\nIn your `Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.56\", features = [\"relay\", \"tcp\", \"noise\", \"yamux\"] }\n```\n\n### 2. Set Up the Relay Client\n\nThe relay client consists of two parts:\n- **`relay::client::Behaviour`** - A `NetworkBehaviour` that handles the relay protocol\n- **`relay::client::Transport`** - A transport that can dial/listen via relays\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    relay, \n    core::transport::OrTransport,\n    identity, Multiaddr, PeerId,\n    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, Swarm},\n    Transport,\n};\n\n// Create a keypair and get your local peer ID\nlet local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();\nlet local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());\n\n// Create the relay client transport and behaviour\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = relay::client::new(local_peer_id);\n```\n\n### 3.

This is useful for synchronizing audio with visual effects, highlighting text, or triggering events at specific points.\n\n### Python Example\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import texttospeech_v1beta1 as tts\n\n# Create a client\nclient = tts.TextToSpeechClient()\n\n# Define SSML input with mark tags\nssml_text = \"\"\"\n<speak>\n    Welcome to the presentation.\n    <mark name=\"slide1\"/>\n    This is the first section.\n    <mark name=\"slide2\"/>\n    Now moving to the second section.\n    <mark name=\"end\"/>\n</speak>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Set up the synthesis input\nsynthesis_input = tts.SynthesisInput(ssml=ssml_text)\n\n# Configure voice parameters\nvoice = tts.VoiceSelectionParams(\n    language_code=\"en-US\",\n    name=\"en-US-Neural2-F\"  # Or any supported voice\n)\n\n# Configure audio output\naudio_config = tts.AudioConfig(\n    audio_encoding=tts.AudioEncoding.MP3\n)\n\n# Make the request with enable_time_pointing\nresponse = client.synthesize_speech(\n    input=synthesis_input,\n    voice=voice,\n    audio_config=audio_config,\n    enable_time_pointing=[tts.SynthesizeSpeechRequest.TimepointType.SSML_MARK]\n)\n\n# Access the audio content\naudio_content = response.audio_content\n\n# Access the timepoints\nfor timepoint in response.timepoints:\n    print(f\"Mark '{timepoint.mark_name}' at {timepoint.time_seconds} seconds\")\n\n# Save the audio\nwith open(\"output.mp3\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(audio_content)\n```\n\n### REST API Example\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"input\": {\n      \"ssml\": \"<speak>Hello <mark name=\\\"marker1\\\"/> world <mark name=\\\"marker2\\\"/></speak>\"\n    },\n    \"voice\": {\n      \"languageCode\": \"en-US\",\n      \"name\": \"en-US-Neural2-F\"\n    },\n    \"audioConfig\": {\n      \"audioEncoding\": \"MP3\"\n    },\n    \"enableTimePointing\": [\"SSML_MARK\"]\n  }' \\\n  \"https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize\"\n```\n\n### Node.js Example\n\n```javascript\nconst textToSpeech = require('@google-cloud/text-to-speech').v1beta1;\n\nconst client = new textToSpeech.TextToSpeechClient();\n\nasync function synthesizeWithTimepoints() {\n  const request = {\n    input: {\n      ssml: '<speak>First part <mark name=\"a\"/> second part <mark name=\"b\"/></speak>'\n    },\n    voice: {\n      languageCode: 'en-US',\n      name: 'en-US-Neural2-F'\n    },\n    audioConfig: {\n      audioEncoding: 'MP3'\n    },\n    enableTimePointing: ['SSML_MARK']\n  };\n\n  const [response] = await client.synthesizeSpeech(request);\n  \n  // Access timepoints\n  response.timepoints.forEach(tp => {\n    console.log(`Mark: ${tp.markName}, Time: ${tp.timeSeconds}s`);\n  });\n  \n  return response;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Use v1beta1**: This feature is only available in the beta version of the API, not the stable v1.\n\n2. **SSML Input Required**: You must use SSML input (not plain text) to include `<mark>` tags.\n\n3. **Mark Tag Format**: Use `<mark name=\"your_marker_name\"/>` in your SSML.\n\n4. **Response Structure**: The response contains:\n   - `audio_content`: The synthesized audio bytes\n   - `timepoints`: A list of timepoint objects with `mark_name` and `time_seconds`\n\n5. **Known Limitation**: Some users have reported issues where timepoints only return up to the first period in certain scenarios. If you encounter this, consider breaking your SSML into smaller segments or checking for API updates.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\n# Python\npip install google-cloud-texttospeech\n\n# Node.js\nnpm install @google-cloud/text-to-speech\n```\n\nMake sure you have proper authentication set up (service account or application default credentials).","hint":"A good answer must explain that in Google Cloud Text-to-Speech v1beta1 you enable timepointing by setting the `enable_time_pointing` (or `enableTimePointing` in REST) field of `SynthesizeSpeechRequest` to `[TimepointType.SSML_MARK]` and using SSML `<mark>` tags in the input, then reading the returned `timepoints` array (with `markName` and `timeSeconds`) from the response.

Let me provide a detailed guide on how to fix these issues.\n\n## How to Fix Breaking Changes in LiveKit Agents v1.2 MCP Implementation\n\nBased on my research, here are the main MCP-related issues in LiveKit agents v1.2.x and their fixes:\n\n### 1. **`meta` Parameter Error with OpenAI Realtime API** (v1.2.8)\n\n**Issue:** When using MCP servers (especially fast-mcp) with OpenAI Realtime API, you get:\n```\nUnknown parameter: 'session.tools[X].meta'\n```\n\n**Fix:** Upgrade to v1.2.9+ which includes the fix from [PR #3402](https://github.com/livekit/agents/pull/3402). Alternatively:\n- Disable the `meta` parameter in your MCP server configuration if possible\n- Or upgrade to the latest version: `pip install livekit-agents>=1.3.0`\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Agent Silent After MCP Tool Execution** (v1.2.7)\n\n**Issue:** Agent stops responding verbally after using an MCP tool successfully (regression from v1.2.6).\n\n**Fix:** \n- Downgrade to v1.2.6 if this is critical: `pip install livekit-agents==1.2.6`\n- Or upgrade to v1.3.x which has many MCP stability fixes\n\n---\n\n### 3. **`ClosedResourceError` During MCP Tool Calls** (v1.2.6)\n\n**Issue:** `anyio.ClosedResourceError` when agent attempts to call MCP server tools.\n\n**Fix:** \n- Ensure proper async context management\n- Increase the `client_session_timeout_seconds` parameter:\n```python\nmcp_server = mcp.MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=server_url,\n    client_session_timeout_seconds=600  # Increase timeout\n)\n```\n- Upgrade to latest stable version (1.3.x)\n\n---\n\n### 4. **`$schema` Field Breaking Google Realtime API** (v1.2.x)\n\n**Issue:** MCP tools include `$schema` in parameters which Google Realtime API rejects.\n\n**Fix:** This was addressed in later versions. Upgrade to v1.3.x:\n```bash\npip install livekit-agents>=1.3.10\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Migration from v0.x to v1.x (Required for MCP Support)**\n\nIf you're still on v0.x, you must migrate to use MCP:\n\n**Key changes:**\n```python\n# OLD (v0.x)\nfrom livekit.agents.pipeline import VoicePipelineAgent\nagent = VoicePipelineAgent(vad=..., stt=..., llm=..., tts=...)\n\n# NEW (v1.x)\nfrom livekit.agents import AgentSession, Agent\n\nclass MyAgent(Agent):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__(instructions=\"Your instructions here\")\n\nsession = AgentSession(\n    stt=deepgram.STT(),\n    llm=openai.LLM(),  # or openai.realtime.RealtimeModel()\n    tts=elevenlabs.TTS(),\n    vad=silero.VAD.load(),\n    mcp_servers=[mcp.MCPServerHTTP(url=\"...\")]  # MCP support\n)\nawait session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=MyAgent())\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for MCP in v1.2+**\n\n```python\nfrom livekit.agents import AgentSession, Agent\nfrom livekit.agents.llm import mcp\nfrom livekit.plugins import openai, deepgram, silero\n\n# 1.
