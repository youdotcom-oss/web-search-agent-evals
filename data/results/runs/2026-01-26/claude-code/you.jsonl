{"id":"websearch-49","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Pulumi Azure AI Foundry GPT model deployment 2026</web-search>","output":"Based on my search, here's the current information about Pulumi Azure AI Foundry GPT model deployment in 2026:\n\n## Azure AI Foundry Overview (2026)\n\n**Latest Models Available:**\n- **GPT-5.2-Codex** (announced Jan 14, 2026) - OpenAI's most advanced agentic coding model\n  - 400K token context window (~100K lines of code)\n  - Multimodal inputs (code, images, natural language)\n  - Pricing: $1.75/1M input tokens, $0.175/1M cached input tokens, $14.00/1M output tokens\n  \n- **GPT-5.2** (announced Dec 12, 2025) - Latest enterprise AI model\n- **GPT-5** (generally available Aug 2025)\n- **GPT-4.1** model series (announced Nov 18, 2025)\n\n## Deployment Options in Azure AI Foundry\n\nAzure AI Foundry (formerly Azure OpenAI Service) offers three deployment modes:\n\n1. **Standard (TPU-backed)** -

{"id":"websearch-212","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Docker bypass UFW firewall solution 2024 container internal network external traffic</web-search>","output":"Based on the search results, I found comprehensive information about the Docker and UFW firewall bypass issue and its solutions. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## The Problem: Docker Bypasses UFW Firewall\n\nDocker manipulates `iptables` directly, completely bypassing UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) rules. When you publish container ports using `-p` or `--publish`, Docker inserts its own ACCEPT rules into iptables that take precedence over UFW rules.\n\n**Why it happens:**\n- Docker creates its own iptables chains (like `DOCKER` and `DOCKER-USER`)\n- These rules are evaluated **before** UFW's chains in the packet filtering pipeline\n- When a packet arrives on a published Docker port, Docker accepts it before UFW can evaluate it\n- Result: Ports you think are blocked by UFW are actually publicly accessible\n\n## The Solution (2024/2025 Approach)\n\nThe recommended fix involves modifying UFW configuration to integrate with Docker's `DOCKER-USER` chain:\n\n### Step 1: Edit UFW After Rules\n\nAdd the following to `/etc/ufw/after.rules` at the end of the file (before COMMIT):\n\n```bash\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [0:0]\n:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [0:0]\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 172.16.0.0/12\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] \"\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\n### Step 2: Restart UFW\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n# or\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\nIf rules don't take effect, reboot the server.\n\n### Step 3: Allow Specific Container Access\n\nAfter applying the rules, **all Docker ports are blocked by default**. To allow public access:\n\n**Allow any container on port 80:**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to any port 80\n```\n\n**Allow specific container by IP (e.g., 172.17.0.2):**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to 172.17.0.2 port 80\n```\n\n**For UDP services (e.g., DNS on port 53):**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto udp from any to any port 53\n```\n\n## Alternative: Bind to Localhost Only\n\nAnother approach is to bind Docker ports to localhost and use a reverse proxy:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  app:\n    ports:\n      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80  # Only accessible locally\n```\n\nThen use nginx or Caddy on the host to proxy public traffic.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Docker's iptables rules bypass UFW by design, not due to a bug\n- The `DOCKER-USER` chain is the official Docker mechanism for firewall integration\n- Internal container-to-container communication still works with proper configuration\n- Always explicitly allow the ports you want to expose publicly\n\nSources:\n- [Docker + ufw: When convenience turns into a security risk | Lukas Rotermund](https://lukasrotermund.de/posts/docker-and-ufw_when-convenience-turns-into-a-security-risk/)\n- [Why Docker Bypassed My UFW Firewall & How You Can Fix It](https://rithwik.hashnode.dev/how-docker-can-be-sneaky-around-your-ufw-firewall)\n- [Docker, UFW, and the Hidden Firewall Bypass: A Deep Technical Breakdown](https://blogs.srikanthkarthi.tech/blog/docker-ufw-firewall-bypass)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":41035},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017vDQy87kQ3sCxMNRYfMFXU","status":"completed","timestamp":41035},{"type":"message","content":"I found several recent resources about Docker bypassing UFW firewall.

When you publish container ports using `-p` or `--publish`, Docker inserts its own ACCEPT rules into iptables that take precedence over UFW rules.\n\n**Why it happens:**\n- Docker creates its own iptables chains (like `DOCKER` and `DOCKER-USER`)\n- These rules are evaluated **before** UFW's chains in the packet filtering pipeline\n- When a packet arrives on a published Docker port, Docker accepts it before UFW can evaluate it\n- Result: Ports you think are blocked by UFW are actually publicly accessible\n\n## The Solution (2024/2025 Approach)\n\nThe recommended fix involves modifying UFW configuration to integrate with Docker's `DOCKER-USER` chain:\n\n### Step 1: Edit UFW After Rules\n\nAdd the following to `/etc/ufw/after.rules` at the end of the file (before COMMIT):\n\n```bash\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [0:0]\n:ufw-docker-logging-deny - [0:0]\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p udp -m udp --dport 0:32767 -d 172.16.0.0/12\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\n\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -m limit --limit 3/min --limit-burst 10 -j LOG --log-prefix \"[UFW DOCKER BLOCK] \"\n-A ufw-docker-logging-deny -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\n### Step 2: Restart UFW\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n# or\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\nIf rules don't take effect, reboot the server.\n\n### Step 3: Allow Specific Container Access\n\nAfter applying the rules, **all Docker ports are blocked by default**. To allow public access:\n\n**Allow any container on port 80:**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to any port 80\n```\n\n**Allow specific container by IP (e.g., 172.17.0.2):**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to 172.17.0.2 port 80\n```\n\n**For UDP services (e.g., DNS on port 53):**\n```bash\nufw route allow proto udp from any to any port 53\n```\n\n## Alternative: Bind to Localhost Only\n\nAnother approach is to bind Docker ports to localhost and use a reverse proxy:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  app:\n    ports:\n      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80  # Only accessible locally\n```\n\nThen use nginx or Caddy on the host to proxy public traffic.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Docker's iptables rules bypass UFW by design, not due to a bug\n- The `DOCKER-USER` chain is the official Docker mechanism for firewall integration\n- Internal container-to-container communication still works with proper configuration\n- Always explicitly allow the ports you want to expose publicly\n\nSources:\n- [Docker + ufw: When convenience turns into a security risk | Lukas Rotermund](https://lukasrotermund.de/posts/docker-and-ufw_when-convenience-turns-into-a-security-risk/)\n- [Why Docker Bypassed My UFW Firewall & How You Can Fix It](https://rithwik.hashnode.dev/how-docker-can-be-sneaky-around-your-ufw-firewall)\n- [Docker, UFW, and the Hidden Firewall Bypass: A Deep Technical Breakdown](https://blogs.srikanthkarthi.tech/blog/docker-ufw-firewall-bypass)","timestamp":41035}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"Docker_Networking","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcp_server":"ydc-server","expected_tools":["you-search","you-express"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769457637614,"end":1769457678649,"firstResponse":41035,"sessionCreation":0,"total":41035},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.95,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

Define Default Values**\nSet default parameter values to `NULL` in your PostgreSQL function:\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION my_function(\n  required_param text,\n  optional_array text[] DEFAULT NULL\n)\n```\n\n**2. Handle NULL in WHERE Clauses**\nPostgreSQL doesn't automatically skip NULL comparisons in WHERE clauses. You need to explicitly handle optional parameters:\n\n```sql\n-- Best practice: Use OR condition\nWHERE (optional_array IS NULL OR column_name = ANY(optional_array))\n\n-- Alternative: Use COALESCE\nWHERE COALESCE(column_name = ANY(optional_array), true)\n```\n\n**3. Calling from JavaScript**\nWhen calling RPC functions from the JavaScript client, you have options:\n\n```javascript\n// Pass undefined for optional parameters (Supabase handles this)\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('my_function', {\n  required_param: 'value'\n  // optional_array is omitted\n})\n\n// Or explicitly pass null\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('my_function', {\n  required_param: 'value',\n  optional_array: null\n})\n\n// Pass array when needed\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('my_function', {\n  required_param: 'value',\n  optional_array: ['item1', 'item2']\n})\n```\n\n## Supabase Pricing 2026\n\n### Edge Functions Pricing\nAccording to the latest documentation:\n\n| Plan | Quota | Over-Usage |\n|------|-------|------------|\n| Free | 500,000 invocations | Not available |\n| Pro | 2 million invocations | $2 per 1 million invocations |\n| Team | 2 million invocations | $2 per 1 million invocations |\n| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |\n\n**Key Points:**\n- You're only charged for usage exceeding your subscription plan's quota\n- Pricing is $2 per 1 million invocations for over-usage on Pro and Team plans\n- Database RPC functions are executed within your database and don't incur Edge Function invocation charges\n\n### When to Use Database Functions vs Edge Functions\n- **Database Functions (RPC)**: Use for data-intensive operations executed within your database.

This is particularly useful for computing metrics like Time to First Byte (TTFB).\n\n### How Trace Callbacks Work\n\nThe trace extension accepts a callback function that receives two arguments:\n- `event_name`: A string describing the event (e.g., \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\")\n- `info`: A dictionary containing event-specific information\n\n### Complete Example: Computing TTFB\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef trace_callback(event_name, info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Track timing for different stages of the HTTP request.\n    \"\"\"\n    if event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.started\":\n        # Record when we start sending the request\n        info['start_time'] = time.perf_counter()\n    \n    elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n        # This is when we receive the first byte (response headers)\n        if 'start_time' in info:\n            ttfb = time.perf_counter() -

Request begins\n- `http11.send_request_body.complete` - Request fully sent\n- `http11.receive_response_headers.complete` - **TTFB moment** (first byte received)\n- `http11.receive_response_body.complete` - Response fully received\n\n**HTTP/2:**\n- `http2.send_request_headers.started`\n- `http2.receive_response_headers.complete` - **TTFB for HTTP/2**\n- `http2.receive_response_body.complete`\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Async callbacks**: When using `httpx.AsyncClient`, your trace callback MUST be an `async def` function\n2. **State management**: Use closures or classes to maintain state across events\n3. **Event availability**: The exact events may vary between httpx/httpcore versions\n4. **Response headers format**: In the trace callback, headers are returned as a list of tuples with bytes: `[(b'Header-Name', b'value'), ...]`\n\nSources:\n- [HTTPX Event Hooks Documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/event-hooks/)\n- [HTTPX Extensions Documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/extensions/)\n- [Stack Overflow: Getting TTFB for HTTP Request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/744532/getting-ttfb-time-till-first-byte-for-an-http-request)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about httpx trace callbacks for response headers timing and TTFB computation in Python.","timestamp":50962},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":50962},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01T5ZSDychTYydaTK9EZXiRf","status":"completed","timestamp":50962},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from the most relevant sources, particularly the HTTPX documentation on event hooks and extensions.","timestamp":50962},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":50962},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Lnftx2knQV59niYY7a2m5r","status":"completed","timestamp":50962},{"type":"message","content":"Perfect!

Request begins\n- `http11.send_request_body.complete` - Request fully sent\n- `http11.receive_response_headers.complete` - **TTFB moment** (first byte received)\n- `http11.receive_response_body.complete` - Response fully received\n\n**HTTP/2:**\n- `http2.send_request_headers.started`\n- `http2.receive_response_headers.complete` - **TTFB for HTTP/2**\n- `http2.receive_response_body.complete`\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Async callbacks**: When using `httpx.AsyncClient`, your trace callback MUST be an `async def` function\n2. **State management**: Use closures or classes to maintain state across events\n3. **Event availability**: The exact events may vary between httpx/httpcore versions\n4. **Response headers format**: In the trace callback, headers are returned as a list of tuples with bytes: `[(b'Header-Name', b'value'), ...]`\n\nSources:\n- [HTTPX Event Hooks Documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/event-hooks/)\n- [HTTPX Extensions Documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/extensions/)\n- [Stack Overflow: Getting TTFB for HTTP Request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/744532/getting-ttfb-time-till-first-byte-for-an-http-request)","timestamp":50962}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"HTTPX tracing","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcp_server":"ydc-server","expected_tools":["you-search","you-express"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769458845472,"end":1769458896434,"firstResponse":50962,"sessionCreation":0,"total":50962},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.95,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

Your app's content will extend behind system bars (status bar and navigation bar) by default.\n\n## WindowInsets Types - Critical for Gesture Navigation\n\nAndroid provides three main types of insets for handling gesture navigation:\n\n### 1. **System Bar Insets** (`WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars()`)\n- Most commonly used for tappable views that must not be visually obscured\n- Represents where system UI displays above your app\n- Use for buttons, FABs, and interactive elements\n\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { v, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n    v.updateLayoutParams<MarginLayoutParams> {\n        leftMargin = insets.left\n        bottomMargin = insets.bottom\n        rightMargin = insets.right\n    }\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **System Gesture Insets** (`WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures()`)\n- Represents areas where **system gestures take priority** over your app\n- Includes bottom inset for home gesture and left/right insets for back gestures\n- Use for swipeable views, bottom sheets, carousels, ViewPager2\n\n```kotlin\nViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { view, windowInsets ->\n    val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemGestures())\n    view.updatePadding(insets.left, insets.top, insets.right, insets.bottom)\n    WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Display Cutout Insets**\n- Handle notches and camera cutouts on devices\n- Combine with system bars for complete coverage\n\n```kotlin\nval bars = insets.getInsets(\n    WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars() or WindowInsetsCompat.Type.displayCutout()\n)\n```\n\n## Chrome on Android - New Edge-to-Edge Behavior (Chrome 135+)\n\nChrome for Android now implements edge-to-edge with a **dynamic \"chin\"** that appears above the gesture navigation bar and retracts when scrolling. Key CSS properties:\n\n### Safe Area Insets for Web\n```css\n.stuck-to-the-bottom {\n    position: fixed;\n    bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px);\n}\n```\n\n### Best Practice: Combine max and current insets\n```css\n:root {\n    --safe-area-max-inset-bottom: env(safe-area-max-inset-bottom, 36px);\n}\n\n.bottom-element {\n    padding-bottom: var(--safe-area-max-inset-bottom);\n    bottom: calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px) - var(--safe-area-max-inset-bottom));\n}\n```\n\n## Jetpack Compose Guidelines\n\n**Starting Android 15, edge-to-edge is mandatory**:\n\n### Use `innerPadding` from Scaffold\n```kotlin\nScaffold(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { innerPadding ->\n    Box(\n        modifier = Modifier\n            .fillMaxSize()\n            .padding(innerPadding) // Handles insets automatically\n    )\n}\n```\n\n### Manual Inset Handling (without Scaffold)\n```kotlin\nColumn(\n    modifier = Modifier\n        .fillMaxSize()\n        .statusBarsPadding()      // Top safe area\n        .navigationBarsPadding()   // Bottom safe area\n)\n```\n\n### Keyboard Handling\n```kotlin\nButton(\n    modifier = Modifier\n        .fillMaxWidth()\n        .imePadding() // Keeps button visible above keyboard\n)\n```\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### Double Insets Problem\nIf insets are applied twice (by library + your code), use `consumeWindowInsets()`:\n\n```kotlin\nScaffold(\n    modifier = Modifier\n        .fillMaxSize()\n        .consumeWindowInsets(PaddingValues())\n) { innerPadding -> ... }\n```\n\n### Gesture Exclusion API\nFor controls that conflict with back gestures (200dp limit per side):\n\n```kotlin\nif (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 29) {\n    view.systemGestureExclusionRects = listOf(exclusionRect)\n}\n```\n\n## Key Guidelines for 2026\n\n1. **Always target SDK 35+** - Edge-to-edge is enforced\n2. **Use `WindowCompat.enableEdgeToEdge(window)`** for backward compatibility on pre-Android 15 devices\n3. **Never apply padding twice** - Store initial padding values\n4. **Set `clipToPadding=\"false\"`** on RecyclerView/ScrollView for proper scrolling behavior\n5. **Material Components** like `BottomNavigationView` handle insets automatically - don't add extra padding\n6. **Test with both gesture and 3-button navigation** modes\n7. **Avoid excessive gesture exclusion zones** - limit to 200dp and only when necessary\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Official Android Edge-to-Edge Documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/edge-to-edge)\n- [Gesture Navigation Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/gesture-navigation)\n- [Chrome Edge-to-Edge Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/edge-to-edge)\n\nSources:\n- [Display content edge-to-edge in views | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/edge-to-edge)\n- [Gesture Navigation and the edge-to-edge experience | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/gesture-navigation)\n- [Chrome on Android edge-to-edge migration guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/edge-to-edge)\n- [Mastering Edge-to-Edge in Android with WindowInsets | Medium](https://medium.com/@farimarwat/mastering-edge-to-edge-in-android-with-windowinsets-cc469168ba34)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets guidelines.","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":63598},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01H1d2GTcMdXeviqq3aPHoUr","status":"completed","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific information from the official Android documentation and some of these resources.","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":63598},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MZsRYMJvGnHpcXTrBk1mHd","status":"completed","timestamp":63598},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011xBcD6caDfofocVx2zjpv8","status":"completed","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific official Android documentation on WindowInsets and gesture navigation.","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":63598},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MRvhKSaD5wDq1Max2S7s9E","status":"completed","timestamp":63598},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Enn6vY51SUKGbgJTS4YKyn","status":"completed","timestamp":63598},{"type":"message","content":"Perfect!

The web application (port 8080)\n- **guacd** - The proxy daemon handling RDP/VNC/SSH protocols\n- **PostgreSQL** (or MySQL/MariaDB) - Database for user management and connections\n\n### Basic Docker Compose Setup\n\nHere's a modern docker-compose.yml configuration for Guacamole with PostgreSQL:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  guacamole-db:\n    image: postgres:15\n    container_name: guac-db\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_USER: guacuser\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: StrongPassword123!\n      POSTGRES_DB: guacamole_db\n    volumes:\n      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    restart: unless-stopped\n\n  guacd:\n    image: guacamole/guacd:1.5.5\n    container_name: guacd\n    restart: unless-stopped\n\n  guacamole:\n    image: guacamole/guacamole:1.5.5\n    container_name: guacamole\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_HOSTNAME: guacamole-db\n      POSTGRES_DATABASE: guacamole_db\n      POSTGRES_USER: guacuser\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: StrongPassword123!\n      GUACD_HOSTNAME: guacd\n      GUACD_PORT: 4822\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    depends_on:\n      - guacamole-db\n      - guacd\n    restart: unless-stopped\n\nvolumes:\n  db_data:\n```\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Initialize PostgreSQL Database Schema:**\n```bash\n# Generate SQL schema\ndocker run --rm guacamole/guacamole:1.5.5 /opt/guacamole/bin/initdb.sh --postgres > initdb.sql\n\n# Import into PostgreSQL\ncat initdb.sql | docker exec -i guac-db psql -U guacuser -d guacamole_db\n```\n\n2. **Start Services:**\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\n3. **Access Guacamole:**\n- URL: `http://your-server-ip:8080/guacamole`\n- Default credentials: `guacadmin` / `guacadmin` (change immediately!)\n\n### Key Features & Benefits\n\n- **Clientless access** - browser-only, no plugins needed\n- **Multi-protocol support** - RDP, VNC, SSH out-of-the-box\n- **Centralized management** - RBAC with database backend\n- **Session recording** - can mount volumes for drive sharing and recordings\n\n### Security Best Practices (2025)\n\n1. **Always use HTTPS** with Nginx reverse proxy and Let's Encrypt\n2. **Change default credentials** immediately\n3. **Use strong database passwords**\n4. **Restrict firewall** to only ports 80/443\n5. **Enable MFA/SSO** where available\n6. **Keep images updated** regularly\n7. **Consider fail2ban** for brute-force protection\n\n### Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name guac.example.com;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/guacamole/;\n        proxy_buffering off;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\n- Secure remote desktop gateway for IT teams\n- Browser-based SSH access to Linux servers\n- VPN-less remote access solution\n- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments\n- Centralized Windows RDP access without client software\n\nSources:\n- [Apache Guacamole Docker Compose Guide (Medium -

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">How do I find information about: LangGraph human interrupt resume how to use Python HumanInterrupt interrupt types Command resume 2026?</web-search>","output":"Based on my search, here's comprehensive information about LangGraph human interrupts and how to use them in Python:\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**LangGraph Interrupts** allow you to pause workflow execution for human input, making it possible to build human-in-the-loop AI agents. This is useful for scenarios like:\n- Approving/rejecting AI decisions\n- Reviewing and editing state\n- Providing additional context\n- Overseeing tool calls\n\n## How to Use `interrupt()` in Python\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n\ndef get_approval(state):\n    \"\"\"Node that pauses for human input\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Task: {state['task']}\")\n    \n    # Pause execution and wait for input\n    decision = interrupt(\"Please enter 'approve' or 'reject' to continue.\")\n    \n    return {'user_decision': decision}\n```\n\n### Resuming Interrupted Workflows\n\nTo resume an interrupted workflow:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\n\n# Initial invocation - will pause at interrupt\nfor event in graph.stream(initial_state, thread_config):\n    print(event)\n\n# Resume with user input\nfor event in graph.stream(Command(resume='approve'), thread_config):\n    print(event)\n```\n\n## Interrupt Types\n\nLangGraph supports several interrupt mechanisms:\n\n1. **Standard `interrupt()`** - Pause at any point in a node for user input\n2. **`interrupt_before`** - Interrupt before executing a specific node\n3. **`interrupt_after`** - Interrupt after executing a specific node\n4. **Multiple concurrent interrupts** - Handle multiple interrupts at once (new in v0.4)\n\n## Dynamic Routing with `Command`\n\nUse `Command` to control execution flow after interrupts:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\n\ndef router(state) -> Command:\n    \"\"\"Route based on user decision\"\"\"\n    decision = state.get('user_decision', '').lower()\n    \n    if decision == 'approve':\n        return Command(goto='complete_task')\n    else:\n        return Command(goto='cancel_task')\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Checkpointer** - Required for interrupts to work:\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n```\n\n2. **Thread ID** - Track state across invocations:\n```python\nthread_config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': 'unique-id'}}\n```\n\n## New in LangGraph v0.4 (2025)\n\n- Interrupts automatically surface when calling `.invoke()` with default `stream_mode`\n- **Resume multiple interrupts at once** - Map interrupt IDs to resume values for parallel tool calls:\n  ```python\n  # Resume multiple interrupts simultaneously\n  Command(resume={'interrupt_id_1': 'value1', 'interrupt_id_2': 'value2'})\n  ```\n\n## Complete Example\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass WorkflowState(TypedDict):\n    task: str\n    user_decision: str\n    status: str\n\ndef get_approval(state):\n    decision = interrupt(\"Approve or reject?\")\n    return {'user_decision': decision}\n\ndef router(state) -> Command:\n    if state['user_decision'] == 'approve':\n        return Command(goto='complete')\n    return Command(goto='cancel')\n\ndef complete(state):\n    return {'status': 'done'}\n\ndef cancel(state):\n    return {'status': 'canceled'}\n\n# Build graph\nbuilder = StateGraph(WorkflowState)\nbuilder.add_node('get_approval', get_approval)\nbuilder.add_node('router', router)\nbuilder.add_node('complete', complete)\nbuilder.add_node('cancel', cancel)\n\nbuilder.add_edge(START, 'get_approval')\nbuilder.add_edge('get_approval', 'router')\nbuilder.add_edge('complete', END)\nbuilder.add_edge('cancel', END)\n\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\n\n# Execute\nthread = {'configurable': {'thread_id': 'run-1'}}\nfor event in graph.stream({'task': 'Deploy feature'}, thread):\n    print(event)\n\n# Resume with decision\nfor event in graph.stream(Command(resume='approve'), thread):\n    print(event)\n```\n\n## Sources:\n- [Interrupts and Commands in LangGraph: Building Human-in-the-Loop Workflows](https://dev.to/jamesbmour/interrupts-and-commands-in-langgraph-building-human-in-the-loop-workflows-4ngl)\n- [LangGraph v0.4: Working with Interrupts](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/langgraph-v0-4-working-with-interrupts)\n- [LangGraph Interrupts Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts)\n- [Human-in-the-Loop with LangGraph: Mastering Interrupts and Commands](https://medium.com/the-advanced-school-of-ai/human-in-the-loop-with-langgraph-mastering-interrupts-and-commands-9e1cf2183ae3)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about LangGraph human interrupts and how to use them in Python.","timestamp":41140},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":41140},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0193xfSkBTz4fVicvTV8SQeg","status":"completed","timestamp":41140},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from the most relevant sources:","timestamp":41140},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":41140},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":41140},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BcGZCsCQ22NMyh4vQApmEc","status":"completed","timestamp":41140},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01JXnhmepwFFg7q2897Zacdh","status":"completed","timestamp":41140},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search, here's comprehensive information about LangGraph human interrupts and how to use them in Python:\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**LangGraph Interrupts** allow you to pause workflow execution for human input, making it possible to build human-in-the-loop AI agents.

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: PyTorch model loading multiprocessing stuck deadlock solution 2026</web-search>","output":"Based on the latest information from 2025-2026, here are the key solutions for PyTorch model loading multiprocessing deadlock issues:\n\n## Key Solutions for PyTorch Multiprocessing Deadlocks\n\n### 1. **Use `spawn` Start Method (Most Critical)**\nWhen working with CUDA/GPU, always use `spawn` instead of `fork`:\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    main()\n```\n\n**Why this matters:** Forking after CUDA initialization can copy partially initialized CUDA contexts into child processes, leading to deadlocks and crashes. `spawn` starts clean but is slower to initialize.\n\n### 2. **Avoid CUDA Initialization Before Spawning**\nNever initialize CUDA in the parent process before spawning workers. Initialize CUDA inside each worker process instead:\n\n```python\ndef train_worker(rank, world_size):\n    torch.cuda.set_device(rank)  # Initialize CUDA here, not in parent\n    # ... rest of training code\n```\n\n### 3. **Tensor Sharing Best Practices**\n- Don't share CUDA tensors across processes - they're not safely shareable\n- Move tensors to CPU before passing between processes\n- For shared memory, use `tensor.share_memory_()` for CPU tensors only\n- Ensure the sending process stays alive while receivers hold tensor references\n\n### 4. **NCCL Timeout Handling**\nFor distributed training, implement proper timeout handling to prevent infinite hangs:\n\n```python\nimport torch.distributed as dist\n\ndist.init_process_group(\n    backend=\"nccl\",\n    timeout=timedelta(minutes=10)  # Set appropriate timeout\n)\n```\n\n### 5. **DataLoader Configuration**\nInstead of custom multiprocessing, leverage PyTorch's DataLoader:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(\n    dataset=train_dataset,\n    batch_size=128,\n    num_workers=8,          # Start with 4-8 workers\n    pin_memory=True,        # Faster CPU-to-GPU transfer\n    prefetch_factor=4,\n    persistent_workers=True  # Reduces startup overhead\n)\n```\n\n### 6. **Worker Seeding for Determinism**\nSet unique seeds per worker to avoid duplicate augmentations:\n\n```python\ndef seed_worker(worker_id: int):\n    base_seed = 2026\n    seed = base_seed + worker_id\n    random.seed(seed)\n    np.random.seed(seed)\n    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n\n# Pass to DataLoader\nloader = DataLoader(..., worker_init_fn=seed_worker)\n```\n\n### 7. **Common Deadlock Causes to Avoid**\n- **Don't pass large objects through queues** - use shared memory or indices instead\n- **Guard entry points** with `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` to prevent spawn storms\n- **Don't hold file handles** in parent before forking\n- **Limit worker count** - too many workers (>16) can cause cache thrashing\n- **Set queue sizes appropriately** - too small causes stalls, too large wastes memory\n\n### 8. **Load State Dict Issues**\nIf `load_state_dict()` causes deadlocks in multiprocessing:\n- Load models inside each worker process, not in the parent\n- Use `torch.load` with `map_location` to load to CPU first\n- Ensure proper serialization with `weights_only=True` (PyTorch 2.x+)\n\n### 9. **Modern Pattern Recommendations (2026)**\n\n| Traditional Approach | Modern Pattern (2026) |\n|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Manual `multiprocessing.Pool` | `DataLoader` workers + caching |\n| `fork` default | Explicit `spawn` for CUDA |\n| Custom IPC queues | DDP or `torchrun` for multi-GPU |\n| Forked processes with CUDA | Spawned workers with explicit device setup |\n\n### 10. **Debugging Workflow**\nWhen encountering deadlocks:\n1. Reproduce with `num_workers=0` first\n2. Force `spawn` start method\n3. Add verbose logging with process IDs\n4. Set `timeout` in DataLoader\n5. Check for unpicklable objects in your dataset\n\n## Performance Expectations\n- CPU-heavy preprocessing: 1.5× to 5× speedup with proper multiprocessing\n- DataLoader tuning: 10-40% faster training loops\n- Multi-GPU with DDP: near-linear scaling up to 4-8 GPUs\n\nThe key insight from 2026 is that most deadlock issues stem from mixing CUDA contexts across process boundaries and improper start method selection. Using `spawn` consistently and initializing CUDA only within worker processes resolves the majority of deadlock scenarios.\n\nSources:\n- [Multiprocessing in Python and PyTorch: A Practical, Modern Guide](https://thelinuxcode.com/multiprocessing-in-python-and-pytorch-a-practical-modern-guide/)\n- [Multiprocessing in Python and PyTorch: Faster Training, Safer Pipelines, Real‑World Patterns](https://thelinuxcode.com/multiprocessing-in-python-and-pytorch-faster-training-safer-pipelines-realworld-patterns/)\n- [Better nccl timeout handling · Issue #163546 · pytorch/pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/163546)\n- [PyTorch Multiprocessing best practices](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about PyTorch model loading multiprocessing deadlock issues and solutions.","timestamp":60215},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":60215},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LsbmSpLTQzNp2XCLBkZafw","status":"completed","timestamp":60215},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from the most relevant results:","timestamp":60215},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":60215},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":60215},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EN17HCwjgTVWYFKTEjCb5r","status":"completed","timestamp":60215},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AJFZAELESK3APJNmaw39Wt","status":"completed","timestamp":60215},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest information from 2025-2026, here are the key solutions for PyTorch model loading multiprocessing deadlock issues:\n\n## Key Solutions for PyTorch Multiprocessing Deadlocks\n\n### 1. **Use `spawn` Start Method (Most Critical)**\nWhen working with CUDA/GPU, always use `spawn` instead of `fork`:\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mp.set_start_method(\"spawn\", force=True)\n    main()\n```\n\n**Why this matters:** Forking after CUDA initialization can copy partially initialized CUDA contexts into child processes, leading to deadlocks and crashes. `spawn` starts clean but is slower to initialize.\n\n### 2. **Avoid CUDA Initialization Before Spawning**\nNever initialize CUDA in the parent process before spawning workers.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## CSS background-clip: text with Radial Gradients and Hover Effects\n\nThe combination of `background-clip: text` with radial gradients and hover effects is a modern CSS technique that creates visually striking text effects.

The issue is not specific to `govulncheck`, but rather a broader compatibility problem with Go tooling when there's a version mismatch. Let me provide you with what I found:\n\n## Summary\n\nThe \"file requires newer Go version\" error occurs when Go tools (including `govulncheck`, `staticcheck`, `golangci-lint`, etc.) are built with an older Go version (like Go 1.24) but are trying to analyze code that requires a newer Go version (like Go 1.25).\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**The Problem:**\n- When a Go tool is compiled with Go 1.24, it cannot properly parse or analyze code that uses Go 1.25 features or has `go 1.25` in its `go.mod` file\n- The error typically appears as: `\"file requires newer Go version go1.25 (application built with go1.24)\"`\n- This is particularly problematic in CI environments where you can't easily rebuild the tools\n\n**Why This Happens:**\nGo tools can only analyze code written for Go versions that are less than or equal to the Go version they were built with. The Go compiler and standard library change between versions, including internal APIs and language features that these tools rely on.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Use official binaries built with the newer Go version** - Wait for the tool maintainers to release versions built with Go 1.25\n\n2. **Build the tool yourself with the correct Go version:**\n   ```bash\n   go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest\n   ```\n   This will build `govulncheck` with your current Go version.\n\n3. **For CI environments:**\n   - Install the tool using `go install` in your CI pipeline rather than using pre-built binaries\n   - Ensure your CI uses Go 1.25 (or whichever version your code requires)\n\n4. **Package managers may lag** - Homebrew, Nix, and other package managers may be slow to update their Go version, resulting in tools built with older Go versions even after new releases\n\n**Verification:**\nYou can check which Go version was used to build a tool:\n```bash\ngovulncheck -version\n```\n\n## Sources:\n- [Create release built with 1.25 · Issue #1674 · dominikh/go-tools](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/issues/1674)\n- [go1.25 support · Issue #5873 · golangci/golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/issues/5873)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about this govulncheck issue with Go 1.24.","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":47337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KbLgNpznpt1ou3sWCCpiM8","status":"completed","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"Let me fetch the content from this GitHub issue to get more details:","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":47337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YDPgFSaS2YjsnvotQ8odjG","status":"completed","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more information about govulncheck specifically with Go 1.24/1.25:","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":47337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011WFqKiEKSy2vFyPHb3ExJu","status":"completed","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"Let me try a broader search about Go 1.24 compatibility issues:","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":47337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018frCGbyh353G6aWv5wFA4q","status":"completed","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get content from the golangci-lint issue which seems related:","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":47337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KcXjGDcCom2GS5gKYy7qaF","status":"completed","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search more specifically for govulncheck issues:","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":47337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PbhhgBK23RM6qP8MxBYE3N","status":"completed","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":47337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Bgh6BN5U4w5xHdBFrpC2YQ","status":"completed","timestamp":47337},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I found information about a similar issue affecting Go static analysis tools.

{"id":"websearch-1088","input":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: \"/customers/{customer_id}/credits/ledger_entry\" 500 2026</web-search>","output":"## Summary\n\nBased on my search, here's what I found about `/customers/{customer_id}/credits/ledger_entry` and 500 errors:\n\n### About the Endpoint\n\nThe `/customers/{customer_id}/credits/ledger` endpoint is part of the **Orb API** - a billing and usage-based pricing platform. Specifically:\n\n**Endpoint**: `GET /customers/external_customer_id/{external_customer_id}/credits/ledger`\n\n**Purpose**: Fetches the customer credits ledger, which provides auditing functionality over Orb's credits system with a list of actions that have modified a customer's credit balance.\n\n**Entry Types** returned by this endpoint include:\n- **Increment** - Credits added via API\n- **Decrement** - Credits deducted (manually or automatically from usage)\n- **Expiration change** - Credits expiry date modified\n- **Credits expiry** - Credits expired on their expiration date\n- **Void initiated** - Credit blocks voided via API\n- **Void** - Voided credits reflected in balance\n- **Amendment** - Credits added as corrections\n\n### About 500 Errors\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific 2026 incidents or documentation about 500 errors on this particular Orb endpoint, **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error** responses generally indicate:\n\n1. **Server-side issues** - Problems with Orb's API infrastructure\n2. **Database problems** - Issues querying ledger entry data\n3. **Invalid data states** - Corrupted or inconsistent credit ledger data\n4. **Timeout issues** - Large ledger queries exceeding timeout limits\n\n### Troubleshooting Recommendations\n\n1.

Specifically:\n\n**Endpoint**: `GET /customers/external_customer_id/{external_customer_id}/credits/ledger`\n\n**Purpose**: Fetches the customer credits ledger, which provides auditing functionality over Orb's credits system with a list of actions that have modified a customer's credit balance.\n\n**Entry Types** returned by this endpoint include:\n- **Increment** - Credits added via API\n- **Decrement** - Credits deducted (manually or automatically from usage)\n- **Expiration change** - Credits expiry date modified\n- **Credits expiry** - Credits expired on their expiration date\n- **Void initiated** - Credit blocks voided via API\n- **Void** - Voided credits reflected in balance\n- **Amendment** - Credits added as corrections\n\n### About 500 Errors\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific 2026 incidents or documentation about 500 errors on this particular Orb endpoint, **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error** responses generally indicate:\n\n1. **Server-side issues** - Problems with Orb's API infrastructure\n2. **Database problems** - Issues querying ledger entry data\n3. **Invalid data states** - Corrupted or inconsistent credit ledger data\n4. **Timeout issues** - Large ledger queries exceeding timeout limits\n\n### Troubleshooting Recommendations\n\n1. Check Orb's status page for any ongoing incidents\n2. Verify the `external_customer_id` parameter is valid\n3. Check query parameters (limit, currency, entry_type, etc.) for valid values\n4. Contact Orb support with the specific error details\n5.

Kiliána 2026</web-search>","output":"Based on my search, here's the current information about Davle, the church (kostel), and St. Kilian's Island (Ostrov sv.

This allows malicious payloads to execute under the guise of legitimate libraries, making detection significantly more challenging.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe technique follows these key steps:\n\n**1. DLL Loading Phase:**\n- The attacker's executable uses `LoadLibrary` or `LoadLibraryEx` to load a benign \"decoy\" DLL (commonly AMSI.dll, but any DLL works) into the target process\n- This can occur in the current process or in a remote process via remote thread injection\n- The decoy DLL is chosen because it's typically trusted and won't raise immediate suspicion\n\n**2. Memory Mapping and Parsing:**\n- Once loaded, the attacker parses the DLL's PE (Portable Executable) headers\n- Specifically, they parse the DOS header (MZ header) and NT headers to locate the DLL's entry point\n- The entry point is typically `DllMain` under standard configurations\n\n**3. Memory Overwrites:**\n- The attacker modifies memory permissions at the entry point using `VirtualProtect` to make it writable (PAGE_READWRITE)\n- Malicious shellcode (often Meterpreter or other payloads) is copied over the original entry point code using `memcpy`\n- Memory permissions are restored to their original state to avoid detection\n\n**4. Execution:**\n- A new thread is created with `CreateThread`, pointing to the compromised entry point\n- The malicious code executes while appearing to originate from a legitimate DLL\n\n### Two Main Approaches\n\n**Simple Approach:**\n- Loads the DLL into the current process\n- Overwrites its entry point\n- Executes via thread creation\n\n**Advanced Approach:**\n- Spawns a new remote process (often with PPID spoofing)\n- Remotely instructs that process to load the DLL via `CreateRemoteThread`\n- Iterates through remote process modules to find the loaded DLL address\n- Remotely writes malicious payload and executes it\n\n### Why It's Effective\n\n**Evasion Capabilities:**\n- **Legitimate file on disk** - The original DLL remains unchanged, so file integrity checks and static analysis fail\n- **Memory-only modification** - The malicious code exists only in RAM, not on disk\n- **Trusted parent process** - The process tree appears normal with legitimate executables\n- **Benign loaded modules** - Security tools see legitimate DLLs loaded, not suspicious executables\n\n### Detection Challenges\n\nTraditional detection methods struggle because:\n- File-based antivirus scans find nothing wrong\n- The process and all loaded DLLs appear legitimate\n- Memory allocations use existing DLL space rather than new suspicious allocations\n- The technique avoids common injection indicators like `VirtualAllocEx` for new memory regions\n\n### Detection Methods (2024)\n\nAccording to VMRay's December 2024 detection highlights, modern detection focuses on:\n\n**Behavioral Analysis:**\n- Monitoring for unexpected memory permission changes in DLL regions\n- Detecting writes to code sections of loaded modules\n- Tracking thread creation with entry points in modified DLL memory\n- Identifying mismatches between disk and memory versions of DLLs\n\n**Memory Forensics:**\n- Comparing in-memory DLL contents against their disk counterparts\n- Monitoring for `VirtualProtect` calls on executable memory regions\n- Tracking thread start addresses pointing to DLL entry points\n\n**API Monitoring:**\n- Watching for suspicious sequences: LoadLibrary → VirtualProtect → WriteProcessMemory → CreateThread\n- Detecting remote process manipulation combined with DLL loading\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Classification\n\nThis technique is classified under **MITRE ATT&CK T1055: Process Injection** and specifically relates to DLL injection variants.\n\nSources:\n- [TrustedSec: Burrowing a Hollow in a DLL to Hide](https://trustedsec.com/blog/burrowing-a-hollow-in-a-dll-to-hide)\n- [VMRay: Detecting DLL hollowing and phishing using SVGs](https://www.vmray.com/december-2024-detection-highlights-detecting-dll-hollowing-and-phishing-using-svgs-and-an-expanded-set-of-new-yara-rules/)\n- [Elastic: Ten process injection techniques](https://www.elastic.co/blog/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection techniques.","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CrSdfZucehYComiheoMRdZ","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed content from the most relevant sources about this technique:","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NrRTNUKWtthtKAtzDZoB2G","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SKzrNeeRDLQs68PSEsx8zS","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YbNaSkCHSNTrirzBFnkVr2","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"Let me read the file in chunks to extract the relevant information:","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Tn1BtspYm76UC73aQZ5cNe","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01C9iz6VRFP5ufxKHVFZfiEY","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AHnACLCEzqMVbAQUHdFaqr","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"Let me try a different approach and read the saved content more strategically:","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018XF9FrFoAY2iE9mEimLdQQ","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EktA9h9fHT6SWq2SxP2utK","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":72729},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WiGveqi2xAVyozXfcj7pMt","status":"completed","timestamp":72729},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results and technical articles I've retrieved, here's a comprehensive overview of LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection:\n\n## LoadLibraryEx Decoy DLL Memory Hollowing -

Execution:**\n- A new thread is created with `CreateThread`, pointing to the compromised entry point\n- The malicious code executes while appearing to originate from a legitimate DLL\n\n### Two Main Approaches\n\n**Simple Approach:**\n- Loads the DLL into the current process\n- Overwrites its entry point\n- Executes via thread creation\n\n**Advanced Approach:**\n- Spawns a new remote process (often with PPID spoofing)\n- Remotely instructs that process to load the DLL via `CreateRemoteThread`\n- Iterates through remote process modules to find the loaded DLL address\n- Remotely writes malicious payload and executes it\n\n### Why It's Effective\n\n**Evasion Capabilities:**\n- **Legitimate file on disk** - The original DLL remains unchanged, so file integrity checks and static analysis fail\n- **Memory-only modification** - The malicious code exists only in RAM, not on disk\n- **Trusted parent process** - The process tree appears normal with legitimate executables\n- **Benign loaded modules** - Security tools see legitimate DLLs loaded, not suspicious executables\n\n### Detection Challenges\n\nTraditional detection methods struggle because:\n- File-based antivirus scans find nothing wrong\n- The process and all loaded DLLs appear legitimate\n- Memory allocations use existing DLL space rather than new suspicious allocations\n- The technique avoids common injection indicators like `VirtualAllocEx` for new memory regions\n\n### Detection Methods (2024)\n\nAccording to VMRay's December 2024 detection highlights, modern detection focuses on:\n\n**Behavioral Analysis:**\n- Monitoring for unexpected memory permission changes in DLL regions\n- Detecting writes to code sections of loaded modules\n- Tracking thread creation with entry points in modified DLL memory\n- Identifying mismatches between disk and memory versions of DLLs\n\n**Memory Forensics:**\n- Comparing in-memory DLL contents against their disk counterparts\n- Monitoring for `VirtualProtect` calls on executable memory regions\n- Tracking thread start addresses pointing to DLL entry points\n\n**API Monitoring:**\n- Watching for suspicious sequences: LoadLibrary → VirtualProtect → WriteProcessMemory → CreateThread\n- Detecting remote process manipulation combined with DLL loading\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Classification\n\nThis technique is classified under **MITRE ATT&CK T1055: Process Injection** and specifically relates to DLL injection variants.\n\nSources:\n- [TrustedSec: Burrowing a Hollow in a DLL to Hide](https://trustedsec.com/blog/burrowing-a-hollow-in-a-dll-to-hide)\n- [VMRay: Detecting DLL hollowing and phishing using SVGs](https://www.vmray.com/december-2024-detection-highlights-detecting-dll-hollowing-and-phishing-using-svgs-and-an-expanded-set-of-new-yara-rules/)\n- [Elastic: Ten process injection techniques](https://www.elastic.co/blog/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process)","timestamp":72729}],"metadata":{"category":"Research","subcategory":"Security/malware research","lang":"C","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcp_server":"ydc-server","expected_tools":["you-search","you-express"],"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769461198296,"end":1769461271025,"firstResponse":72729,"sessionCreation":0,"total":72729},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":false,"score":0.6,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

This was announced in late 2025 and represents a significant shift toward standardized JSON-based workflows.\n\n**Plugin Development Approaches:**\n\n### 1. **Creating Nodes from JSON Structure**\nThe core architecture for Figma plugins that create nodes from JSON involves:\n\n- **Two-file architecture:**\n  - `ui.html` (iframe) - Handles UI, user input, and API/network requests\n  - `code.js` (sandbox) - Manipulates Figma document nodes\n  - Communication via `postMessage()` between the two contexts\n\n### 2. **Key Implementation Steps**\n\n**Basic Pattern:**\n```javascript\n// In ui.html - fetch/prepare JSON data\nwindow.parent.postMessage({ \n  pluginMessage: { \n    type: \"createNodes\", \n    data: jsonStructure \n  } \n}, \"*\")\n\n// In code.js - create Figma nodes\nfigma.ui.onmessage = msg => {\n  if (msg.type === \"createNodes\") {\n    // Traverse JSON and create corresponding nodes\n    createNodesFromJSON(msg.data)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Node Creation:** Use Figma's API methods like:\n- `figma.createFrame()`\n- `figma.createText()`\n- `figma.createRectangle()`\n- Recursive traversal to handle nested structures\n\n### 3. **Handling Different Data Types**\n\n**Text Layers:**\n```javascript\nconst textNode = figma.createText()\nawait figma.loadFontAsync(fontName)\ntextNode.characters = jsonData.text\n```\n\n**Images:**\nImages require special handling - fetch as blob, convert to `Uint8Array`, then:\n```javascript\nconst image = figma.createImage(imageBytes)\nnode.fills = [{ type: \"IMAGE\", imageHash: image.hash }]\n```\n\n### 4. **Popular Use Cases (2026)**\n\n- **Design token import/export** (now with W3C standard support)\n- **API-driven content population** (mockup data, user profiles, product catalogs)\n- **Design system synchronization** between Figma and code\n- **Bulk content updates** from external data sources\n\n### 5. **Available Tools & Resources**\n\n- Official Figma Plugin API documentation\n- Community plugins like \"Figma to JSON Exporter\" (free)\n- Integration with design token tools aligned to W3C standards\n- GitHub examples and templates for plugin development\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Import JSON Data To Figma: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://biddybytes.com/blog/import-json-data-to-figma-1762611118104)\n- [Step-by-Step: Your First API-Backed Figma Plugin](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-to-create-your-first-figma-plugin-that-pulls-in-api-data-5042572c17a7)\n- [Figma announces native import & export of variables aligning to W3C](https://obra-figma.ghost.io/design-tokens-community-group-w3c-release/)\n- [Reddit: We built a free Figma to JSON Exporter plugin](https://www.reddit.com/r/FigmaDesign/comments/1m0efwp/we_built_a_free_figma_to_json_exporter_plugin/)\n- [Reddit: Json to figma](https://www.reddit.com/r/FigmaDesign/comments/1ncdyb4/json_to_figma/)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about creating Figma plugins that can generate nodes from JSON structures.","timestamp":34821},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":34821},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PvU17cGHkZdQpsmSsyHrPN","status":"completed","timestamp":34821},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from some of these resources:","timestamp":34821},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":34821},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01D86wYC9entoPMyVcs3W9Vb","status":"completed","timestamp":34821},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search for current information about creating Figma plugins that import designs from JSON structures in 2026, here's what I found:\n\n## Current State (2026)\n\n**Native Figma Support:**\nFigma now has native support for importing and exporting design tokens/variables in JSON format, particularly aligned with the W3C Design Tokens Community Group standard.

New API is a second-generation development based on One API with enhanced features.\n\n### New API - Next Generation AI Model Gateway\n\nNew API is a comprehensive AI asset management system that serves as a \"Swiss Army knife\" for AI model integration. Here are the key features:\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n- **Multi-Model Support**: Integrates 20+ AI models including GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, Midjourney, Suno, Gemini, and many more\n- **Unified API Gateway**: Converts various model APIs into OpenAI-compatible format\n- **Asset Management**: Comprehensive billing, quota management, and user management\n- **Channel Management**: Supports multiple API channels with load balancing, priority routing, and weight distribution\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Modern UI with multi-language support\n- Token-based billing and pay-per-call options\n- User grouping with model restrictions\n- Rate limiting to prevent abuse\n- Data dashboard for monitoring usage, consumption, and distribution\n- Cache mechanism (Redis/Memory) for cost optimization\n- Advanced features like reasoning mode for OpenAI o-series and Claude models\n\n### 易支付 (EasyPayment) Integration\n\n易支付 is an online payment system that integrates with New API for user recharging.

Lock-In Effects (锁定效应)\n\nLock-in effects occur when customers become dependent on a company's products or services, making switching to competitors costly or inconvenient. In 2026, this remains a powerful competitive strategy:\n\n**Recent Examples:**\n- **Subscription Software Models**: Adobe's transition to subscription-based services locks customers into ongoing payments while providing continuous updates and features\n- **Ecosystem Lock-In**: Microsoft and Apple continue to leverage hardware-software integration, making platform switching prohibitively expensive for users\n- **Network Effects**: Social platforms and communication tools maintain lock-in through established user networks\n\n### 2. Path Dependence (路径依赖)\n\nPath dependence describes how past decisions constrain future choices, creating self-reinforcing trajectories that are difficult to alter.\n\n**2026 Applications:**\n- **Technology Standards**: The QWERTY keyboard layout remains the classic example - early adoption led to widespread training and familiarity\n- **Market Dominance**: Intel's early investments in microprocessor technology created a path that reinforces their market leadership\n- **Digital Transformation Barriers**: Manufacturing firms face path-dependent obstacles when attempting to adopt digital servitization strategies\n\n### 3. Competitive Barriers (竞争壁垒)\n\nHigh barriers prevent new market entrants and protect established players:\n\n**Current Barriers in 2026:**\n- **Capital Requirements**: Pharmaceutical and technology sectors require substantial R&D investments\n- **Regulatory Hurdles**: Extensive clinical trials and approvals in pharmaceuticals deter new competitors\n- **Proprietary Technology**: Patents and proprietary systems create defensive moats\n- **Brand Loyalty**: Established reputation and customer relationships\n\n### 4. Difficult to Imitate Advantages (难以模仿)\n\nUnique resources or capabilities that competitors cannot easily replicate:\n\n**2026 Examples:**\n- **Tesla's Competitive Advantage**: \n  - Strong innovation and sustainability brand\n  - Proprietary charging infrastructure\n  - Advanced software updates and autonomous driving technology\n  - Organizational culture focused on innovation\n\n- **Intangible Assets**:\n  - Organizational culture\n  - Brand reputation\n  - Proprietary knowledge and processes\n  - Customer relationships and trust\n\n### 5. 2026 Strategic Insights\n\nAccording to recent analysis, companies in 2026 are focusing on:\n\n1. **AI and Technology Integration**: Lock-in through AI-powered ecosystems and automation\n2. **Discernment as Competitive Advantage**: The ability to make better decisions under pressure without eroding trust\n3. **Psychological Safety**: Creating environments that enable sustainable performance\n4. **Relational Capital**: Trust and reputation as competitive assets that marketing budgets cannot replicate\n\n### Chinese Market Focus (2026)\n\nThe Chinese financial media highlights three major investment tracks for 2026:\n1. **Technology Growth Stocks**: AI computing power, semiconductors, autonomous driving, commercial aerospace\n2. **Core Blue-Chip Assets**: Traditional consumption sectors (liquor, real estate)\n3. **High Dividend Stocks**: Banks, insurance, coal, utilities\n\nThese sectors demonstrate various forms of competitive barriers - from technological lock-in in AI to brand loyalty in consumer goods, and regulatory barriers in utilities.\n\n## Sources:\n- [Lock-in Business Model - Gary Fox](https://www.garyfox.co/patterns/lock-in/)\n- [Path Dependence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence)\n- [Principles of Strategic Analysis - Analyst Notes](https://analystnotes.com/cfa-study-notes-principles-of-strategic-analysis.html)\n- [Business Ecosystems and Lock-in - Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11365-025-01078-5)\n- [The Most Overlooked Competitive Advantage in 2026 - Inc.com](https://www.inc.com/paul-gunn/the-most-overlooked-competitive-advantage-in-2026/91290902)\n- [征战2026牛途，锁定这三大赛道 - 新浪财经](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2026-01-06/doc-inhfiznp1392812.shtml)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about lock-in effects, path dependence, competitive barriers, and inimitability in 2026.","timestamp":74811},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":74811},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":74811},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0182piPXA3Xk2KBQ2e87uRyi","status":"completed","timestamp":74811},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01YGJUSP42opU7YJeokcxrjU","status":"completed","timestamp":74811},{"type":"message","content":"I found several relevant search results.

Clear Room Separation**\n- Use distinct cards or sections for each room booked\n- Add visual dividers (borders, spacing, or background shading) between rooms\n- Number each room clearly (Room 1, Room 2, etc.)\n\n**2. Room Details to Display**\nEach room section should include:\n- Room type/name (e.g., \"Deluxe King Room\", \"Standard Double Room\")\n- Number of guests per room\n- Bed configuration\n- Check-in and check-out dates\n- Price per room per night\n- Total price for each room\n- Room-specific amenities or features\n- Guest names assigned to each room (if applicable)\n\n**3. Layout Patterns**\n\n**Vertical Stacking (Most Common)**\n- Stack room cards vertically\n- Each room gets its own expandable/collapsible section\n- Best for mobile responsiveness\n- Clear visual hierarchy\n\n**Accordion Style**\n- Each room as a collapsible accordion item\n- Saves space when multiple rooms are booked\n- Shows summary (room type + price) when collapsed\n- Expands to show full details when clicked\n\n**Summary + Detail View**\n- Top section shows booking summary (total rooms, total price, dates)\n- Scrollable area below with detailed breakdown per room\n- Useful for 3+ rooms\n\n**4. Visual Design Best Practices**\n\n- **Color coding**: Use subtle color variations or borders to distinguish rooms\n- **Icons**: Add guest icons, bed icons, calendar icons for quick scanning\n- **Typography hierarchy**: Room names in bold, details in regular weight\n- **White space**: Adequate padding between rooms prevents visual clutter\n- **Responsive grid**: 2-column layout on desktop, single column on mobile\n\n**5. Interactive Elements**\n\n- Edit buttons for each room (modify guests, room type)\n- Remove/cancel individual rooms\n- Add more rooms option\n- Expand/collapse toggles for room details\n- Room assignment interface (assign guests to specific rooms)\n\n**6. Pricing Transparency**\n\n- Show per-room subtotal\n- Display total for all rooms prominently\n- Break down taxes, fees per room\n- Highlight any room-specific discounts\n- Grand total at bottom with clear visual emphasis\n\n**7. Confirmation Features**\n\n- Unique confirmation number for entire booking\n- Individual room reference numbers (optional)\n- Download/print booking summary button\n- Email confirmation sent indicator\n- Booking modification instructions\n\n**8. Best Practices from Major Platforms**\n\nModern hotel booking sites follow these patterns:\n- Group booking information at the top (hotel name, address, dates)\n- Itemized room list in the middle\n- Payment and pricing summary at bottom\n- Clear call-to-action buttons (Confirm, Modify, Cancel)\n- Progress indicators showing booking step completion\n\n### Design Principles Applied\n\n**Alignment & Grid System**: Maintain consistent alignment across all room cards for professional appearance\n\n**Visual Hierarchy**: Most important info (room type, price) should be largest/boldest\n\n**Accessibility**: Ensure proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support\n\n**Mobile-First**: Design for small screens first, then enhance for larger displays\n\n## Sources:\n- [UI Design of a Hotel Booking Website - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ui-design-of-a-hotel-booking-website/)\n- [Hotel Reservation System Design | UI, UX & Database Guide](https://phptravels.com/blog/hotel-reservation-system-design)\n- [Hotel Booking Website Design Template | Uizard](https://uizard.io/templates/website-templates/hotel-booking-website/)\n- [Hotel booking app UI wireframe example](https://mockflow.com/wireframe-examples/hotel-booking-app-wireframe)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for information about multi-room hotel booking confirmation page UI patterns.","timestamp":51978},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":51979},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_018rNC5LRbvnnBmkckR5brPv","status":"completed","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me get more specific information by fetching content from some of the most relevant pages:","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":51979},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NiV7JEyhgzfnbsg3SDrLM7","status":"completed","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about multi-room booking patterns:","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":51979},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HXHnc8i9RSsh9kQcwJwCsp","status":"completed","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for booking.com or other major hotel sites to see their multi-room confirmation patterns:","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":51979},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011CZRpRiNsuQdabFCP7nCYM","status":"completed","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for best practices in displaying multiple room selections:","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":51979},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01N68837EELGFdXPokMaeyDm","status":"completed","timestamp":51979},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about multi-room hotel booking confirmation page UI patterns:\n\n## Multi-Room Hotel Booking Confirmation Page UI Patterns\n\n### Key Design Elements for Displaying Multiple Rooms\n\n**1.
