{"id":"websearch-2","input":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","output":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?\nExcellent question. Based on current trends and expert\n analysis for 2026, here's a breakdown of the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries\n and pricing tables.\n\n### **Best Landing Page Strategies for 2026**\n\n1.  **AI\n-Powered Personalization**: Expect AI to move beyond chatbots. In 2026, AI will dynamically alter landing page content,\n headlines, and even imagery based on user data, behavior, and demographics. This creates a hyper-personalized experience for each visitor\n.\n\n2.  **Immersive & Interactive Content**: Static pages are becoming less effective. Strategies for 20\n26 focus on:\n    *   **Micro-interactions**: Small animations and feedback on user actions (e.\ng., button clicks, form inputs) to make the page feel alive.\n    *   **3D and Animated\n Graphics**: Tools like Spline and Three.js are becoming more mainstream, allowing for immersive 3D elements that users\n can interact with.\n    *   **Video Content**: Short, benefit-oriented videos that explain the product or service in\n a compelling way.\n\n3.  **Emphasis on Social Proof and Trust**: With increasing skepticism of online marketing, building\n trust is paramount.\n    *   **Video Testimonials**: More authentic and harder to fake than text.\n    *   \n**User-Generated Content**: Showcasing real customers using your product.\n    *   **Clear Privacy Policies and\n Data Usage Information**: Be upfront about how you use customer data.\n\n4.  **Minimalism and \"Glassm\norphism\"**: Clean, simple designs with a focus on typography and whitespace will continue to be popular. The \"glassmorphism\n\" trend (blurred backgrounds with a semi-transparent overlay) adds a modern, futuristic feel.\n\n5.  **Voice\n Search and Conversational UI**: With the rise of voice assistants, landing pages should be optimized for voice search with natural language keywords\n. Conversational UI elements, like more advanced chatbots and interactive forms, will also be key.\n\n### **Responsive Design Patterns for Galleries\n in 2026**\n\n1.  **CSS Grid & `aspect-ratio`**: Forget complex JavaScript\n libraries for masonry layouts. CSS Grid, combined with the `aspect-ratio` property, allows for dynamic, Pinterest-like\n gallery layouts that are both responsive and performant.\n\n2.  **AI-Powered Image Optimization**: In 202\n6, expect services that use AI to not only compress images but also to crop and resize them intelligently for different devices,\n ensuring the most important part of the image is always visible.\n\n3.  **Interactive & Animated Galleries**:\n    *   **\nCinematic Transitions**: Smooth, cinematic transitions between images when a user clicks on a thumbnail.\n    *   **Hover Effects\n**: Subtle hover effects that reveal more information or provide a slight zoom.\n    *   **VR/AR Integration**: For\n certain products, the ability to view a gallery in a virtual or augmented reality environment will be a major differentiator.\n\n4\n.  **Accessibility First**: As digital accessibility becomes a legal requirement in more jurisdictions, galleries must be designed with screen readers and\n keyboard navigation in mind. This includes proper alt text, focus states, and ARIA attributes.\n\n### **Responsive Design Patterns\n for Pricing Tables in 2026**\n\n1.  **Interactive Toggles and Sliders**: Instead of\n static tables, use toggles for monthly/annual pricing and sliders for usage-based pricing. This allows users to see\n the exact pricing for their specific needs.\n\n2.  **\"Card\"-Based Layouts on Mobile**: On mobile devices\n, instead of shrinking a large table, each pricing tier should be a separate \"card\" that can be swiped through\n or stacked vertically. This makes the information much easier to digest on a small screen.\n\n3.  **Feature Comparison\n Matrices with Progressive Disclosure**: For complex pricing with many features, don't show everything at once. Use a \"progressive\n disclosure\" pattern where users can click to expand and see a detailed feature comparison.\n\n4.  **Clear \"Most\n Popular\" or \"Recommended\" Tier**: Use visual cues (e.g., a colored border, a \"Most Popular\" badge)\n to guide users to the pricing tier that is best for them. This simplifies the decision-making process.\n\n5.  \n**Context-Aware Pricing**: For SaaS products, the pricing table could be context-aware, highlighting the features that are most relevant to\n the user based on their behavior on the site.\n\nBy implementing these strategies and patterns, you can create landing pages,\n galleries, and pricing tables that are not only visually appealing but also highly effective at converting visitors into customers in 20\n26.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","timestamp":38175},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":38175},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769680909430-0b249be3731aa","status":"completed","timestamp":38175},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769680909446-40457c6cddb82","status":"completed","timestamp":38175},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769680909465-d1bff735bc6a3","status":"completed","timestamp":38175},{"type":"message","content":"Excellent question.

{"id":"websearch-49","input":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","output":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026\nDeploying a GPT model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026 involves using\n the `azure-native` Pulumi provider to programmatically define and deploy the necessary Azure resources. Azure AI Foundry is a\n platform for working with foundation models, and by provisioning an Azure OpenAI Service and deploying a model to it, the model becomes available within\n the AI Foundry.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how you can accomplish this:\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\n\nBefore you start, you'll need:\n\n*   An Azure account with an active subscription.\n*   \nThe Azure CLI installed and configured. You should be logged in to your Azure account.\n*   The Pulumi CLI installed\n.\n*   Node.js and npm (or your preferred language environment for Pulumi, like Python).\n\n### 2\n. Set Up Your Pulumi Project\n\nFirst, create a new Pulumi project:\n\n\n```bash\nmkdir azure-ai-found\nry-deployment\ncd azure-ai-foundry-deployment\npulumi new azure-typescript\n\n```\n\n\nThis will create\n a new Pulumi project with the necessary files. When prompted, install the dependencies.\n\n### 3. Define Your\n Infrastructure as Code\n\nIn your `index.ts` file, you will define the necessary Azure resources. This includes:\n\n*\n   A **Resource Group**: A logical container for your Azure resources.\n*   An **Azure OpenAI Service Account**: The\n service that will host your GPT model.\n*   A **Model Deployment**: This will deploy a specific GPT model to\n your OpenAI service account.\n\nHere is a Pulumi program in TypeScript that demonstrates this:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport *\n as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n\n// 1. Create a new resource group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"ai\n-foundry-rg\", {\n    location: \"EastUS\", // You can choose a different region\n});\n\n\n// 2. Create an Azure OpenAI Service Account\nconst openAiAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account\n(\"openai-account\", {\n    // A globally unique name for the account\n    accountName: `openai-account-${\npulumi.getStack()}`, \n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",\n\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\", // Choose the appropriate SKU for your needs\n    },\n    location:\n resourceGroup.location,\n});\n\n// 3. Deploy a GPT model\nconst modelDeployment = new azure_native.\ncognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-4o-deployment\", {\n    accountName: openAiAccount.name\n,\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-4o\", // The\n name of your deployment\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            \nname: \"gpt-4o\", // The model you want to deploy\n            version: \"2024-\n05-13\", // Specify the model version\n        },\n    },\n    sku: {\n        \nname: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10, // Define the scale/capacity\n    }\n});\n\n//\n Export the endpoint of the OpenAI account\nexport const endpoint = openAiAccount.properties.apply(p => p.endpoint\n);\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Deploy Your Infrastructure\n\nOnce you have saved your `index.ts` file, you can\n deploy your infrastructure using the Pulumi CLI:\n\n1.  **Preview the deployment:**\n    \n```bash\n    pulumi\n preview\n    \n```\n\n    This command will show you what resources Pulumi will create.\n\n2.  **Deploy\n the resources:**\n    \n```bash\n    pulumi up\n    ```\n\n    You will be prompted to confirm the deployment.\n Once you approve, Pulumi will provision the resources in your Azure account.\n\n### 5. Verify the Deployment in Azure\n AI Foundry\n\nAfter the deployment is complete, you can go to the Azure Portal and navigate to the Azure AI Foundry.\n You will find your new Azure OpenAI Service and the deployed GPT-4o model available for use.\n\nThis approach allows\n you to manage your AI model deployments as code, which is great for versioning, automation, and reproducibility.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","timestamp":43360},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":43360},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769681051225-74998f15a94428","status":"completed","timestamp":43360},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769681051243-7f058f4e6c86e8","status":"completed","timestamp":43360},{"type":"message","content":"Deploying a GPT model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026 involves using","timestamp":43360},{"type":"message","content":" the `azure-native` Pulumi provider to programmatically define and deploy the necessary Azure resources.

{"id":"websearch-88","input":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","output":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?\nIn 2026, LangGraph is projected to offer a mature and robust\n ecosystem for memory state management and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) context injection, building upon its current capabilities with a focus on enterprise\n-readiness, stability, and advanced features. Here’s a detailed overview of what you can expect:\n\n### Memory State\n Management\n\nLangGraph’s approach to memory is designed to be persistent and stateful, allowing for the creation of durable\n, long-running agents. The framework distinguishes between two primary types of memory:\n\n*   **Short-Term Memory\n (Thread-Level Persistence):** This is managed as part of an agent's state and is persisted using \"checkpointers.\" It\n includes conversation history, retrieved documents, and other transient data necessary for a single interaction or thread.\n*   **Long\n-Term Memory (User/Application-Level Persistence):** This allows agents to retain information across multiple sessions. This is crucial for personalization\n and context-aware interactions over time.\n\nBy 2026, you can expect the following enhancements to memory management:\n\n\n*   **Advanced Checkpointers:** The checkpointer system, which already supports backends like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Redis\n, will be more robust. The recent addition of a MongoDB checkpointer and compression for PostgreSQL checkpoints indicates a trend toward more\n scalable and efficient storage solutions.\n*   **Cloud-Native Persistence:** Expect more native support for cloud-managed checkpoint\ning services, making it easier to deploy and manage LangGraph applications in production environments.\n*   **Structured and Serializable\n State:** The state will continue to be strongly typed and serializable, ensuring consistency and enabling powerful debugging features like \"time\n travel\" to inspect previous states.\n\n### RAG Context Injection\n\nLangGraph excels at building \"agentic RAG\n\" systems, where the LLM-powered agent intelligently decides when to retrieve external information. This is a significant step up\n from simply adding retrieved context to a prompt.\n\n*   **Agentic Decision-Making:** The core of RAG in LangGraph\n is the agent's ability to use tools. You define a retriever tool, and the agent decides whether to call that\n tool, another tool, or respond directly to the user. This is managed through conditional edges in the graph.\n*   **\nContext Engineering:** The focus will be on more sophisticated \"context engineering,\" which involves strategically selecting, compressing, and isolating information\n to make the most of the LLM's context window. This could also involve applying RAG to tool descriptions themselves\n to improve tool selection.\n*   **Multi-Agent RAG Architectures:** LangGraph's support for multi\n-agent systems will enable more complex RAG patterns. For example, you could have one agent for query analysis, another for planning\n research steps, and several specialist agents for retrieving information from different sources.\n\n### 2026 Outlook and Key Features\n\n\nThe roadmap for LangGraph points to a more mature and developer-friendly framework by 2026:\n\n*\n   **LangGraph 2.0:** Expected in the second quarter of 2026, this release will focus\n on API stability, improved type safety, and a cleaner developer experience.\n*   **Enhanced Observability:** Deeper integration\n with LangSmith will provide better trace visualization, making it easier to debug complex graph executions.\n*   **Enterprise-\nGrade Guardrails:** Expect more built-in nodes for content filtering, rate limiting, and compliance logging, which are critical\n for enterprise adoption.\n*   **Standardized Agent Communication:** With first-class support for protocols like Agent-to-Agent (\nA2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP), LangGraph agents will be able to communicate more effectively with other agents\n and securely ingest structured business context.\n*   **Mature Tooling:** The LangGraph platform, including tools like LangGraph Studio\n for visual debugging and LangGraph Cloud for deployment, will be more mature, simplifying the entire development lifecycle.\n\nIn summary, by\n 2026, LangGraph will be a powerful and stable framework for building sophisticated AI agents. Its memory management and\n RAG capabilities will be more robust, scalable, and easier to manage, enabling the development of truly intelligent and context-aware applications.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","timestamp":39948},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":39948},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769681139126-c3ad4cce011ca8","status":"completed","timestamp":39948},{"type":"message","content":"In 2026, LangGraph is projected to offer a mature and robust","timestamp":39948},{"type":"message","content":" ecosystem for memory state management and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) context injection, building upon its current capabilities with a focus on enterprise","timestamp":39948},{"type":"message","content":"-readiness, stability, and advanced features.

{"id":"websearch-212","input":"How to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?","output":"How to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?\nDocker bypasses UFW because it directly\n manipulates `iptables`. The recommended way to manage this is to use a tool called `ufw-docker`.\n\n\n### 1. Install `ufw-docker`\n\nThis command downloads the `ufw-docker` script,\n makes it executable, and moves it into a directory in your `PATH`.\n\nI will now explain and then execute the command to download\n and install `ufw-docker`.\nDocker\n bypasses UFW because it directly manipulates iptables. The recommended way to manage this is to use a tool called `uf\nw-docker`.\n\n### 1. Install `ufw-docker`\n\nThis command downloads the `ufw-\ndocker` script, makes it executable, and moves it into a directory in your `PATH`.\n\nI will now explain\n and then execute the command to download and install `ufw-docker`.\nDocker bypasses UFW because it directly manipulates `iptables`, creating its own rules that override\n UFW's settings. This can expose container ports you intended to keep private.\n\nThe most common and recommended solution\n is to use a utility called `ufw-docker`. This script intelligently manages firewall rules to make UFW and Docker work\n together correctly.\n\nHere’s how to set it up:\n\n### 1. Install `ufw-docker`\n\nOpen\n a terminal and run the following commands to download the script and make it executable:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo wget -O\n /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/\nraw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\n\n```\n\n\n\n### 2. Integrate with UFW\n\nNext, run the `ufw-docker` install command. This will\n modify UFW's configuration to filter Docker's traffic correctly.\n\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw-docker install\n\n\n```\n\n\nAfter this, it's a good practice to restart your server for the new rules to take effect reliably\n.\n\n\n```bash\nsudo reboot\n```\n\n\n### 3. Manage Container Ports\n\nNow, you can manage Docker\n container ports just like any other service with UFW. For example, to allow access to a container running on port 808\n0:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw-docker allow <container_name> 8080\n```\n\n\nOr\n, to allow access from a specific IP address:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw-docker allow <container_name>\n 8080 from <ip_address>\n\n```\n\n\n### Alternative: Bind to Localhost\n\nIf your\n containerized service only needs to be accessed from the host machine itself (not from the external network), you can avoid exposing the\n port altogether by binding it to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).\n\nWhen starting your container\n, use the following syntax:\n\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:80\n80:80 my_container\n\n```\n\n\nThis makes the container's port `80` accessible only on\n port `8080` of the host machine's localhost interface.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to stop Docker from bypassing UFW firewall for external traffic and internal networks in 2024?","timestamp":32244},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":32244},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769681421217-5d6ba6d38ab158","status":"completed","timestamp":32244},{"type":"message","content":"Docker bypasses UFW because it directly","timestamp":32244},{"type":"message","content":" manipulates `iptables`.

This is a logical check to prevent wasting\n gas on a transaction that goes nowhere.\n\n### The Solution\n\nThe solution is to add a `require` or `if\n` statement in your Solidity code that checks if the current chain's ID is different from the destination chain's ID before\n initiating the bridging process.\n\nHere is an example of how you might implement this check in a Solidity facet:\n\n\n```sol\nidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\n/**\n * @title\n BridgeFacet\n * @notice A hypothetical facet for handling bridging operations.\n */\ncontract BridgeFacet {\n\n    /**\n\n     * @dev Thrown when a bridging operation attempts to send assets to the same network.\n     * @param current\nChainId The ID of the chain where the transaction originated.\n     * @param destinationChainId The ID of the target\n chain for the bridge operation.\n     */\n    error CannotBridgeToSameNetwork(uint256 currentChainId,\n uint256 destinationChainId);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Initiates a bridge transfer of a token to a different\n chain.\n     * @param _destinationChainId The ID of the chain to bridge to.\n     * @\nparam _token The address of the token to bridge.\n     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to bridge.\n\n     * @param _receiver The address on the destination chain to receive the tokens.\n     */\n    function start\nBridgeTokens(\n        uint256 _destinationChainId,\n        address _token,\n        uint2\n56 _amount,\n        address _receiver\n    ) external {\n        // Get the current chain ID.\n\n        uint256 currentChainId = block.chainid;\n\n        // Prevent bridging to the same network\n.\n        if (currentChainId == _destinationChainId) {\n            revert CannotBridgeToSameNetwork\n(currentChainId, _destinationChainId);\n        }\n\n        // --- Further bridging logic would go here ---\n\n        // e.g., interacting with a specific bridge protocol, locking tokens,\n        // emitting events for off-chain relay\ners, etc.\n\n        // Example: Log a successful initiation (replace with actual bridge event)\n        // emit Bridge\nInitiated(currentChainId, _destinationChainId, _token, _amount, _receiver);\n    }\n\n\n    // Other facet-specific functions...\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1.  **Custom\n Error:** The line `error CannotBridgeToSameNetwork(uint256 currentChainId, uint256\n destinationChainId);` defines a custom error. This is more gas-efficient than using `require` with a string message.\n\n2.  **Get Current Chain ID:** `uint256 currentChainId = block.chainid;\n` retrieves the ID of the chain where the contract is currently being executed.\n3.  **The Check:** \n`if (currentChainId == _destinationChainId)` compares the current chain ID with the destination chain ID provided by the user.\n\n4.  **Revert:** If the chain IDs are the same, `revert CannotBridgeToSameNetwork(\ncurrentChainId, _destinationChainId);` is called. This stops the transaction and returns the custom error with the current\n and destination chain IDs, making it clear to the user what went wrong.\n\nBy implementing this check, you can prevent\n the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error and ensure that your bridging contract functions as expected.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to fix the lifi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error in solidity 2026","timestamp":28681},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":28681},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769681702681-7b8f711a78ca88","status":"completed","timestamp":28681},{"type":"message","content":"The `CannotBridgeTo","timestamp":28681},{"type":"message","content":"SameNetwork` error in Solidity, especially within the context of LI.FI's diamond standard implementation (\"facets\"), is","timestamp":28681},{"type":"message","content":" a custom error that prevents users from accidentally bridging funds to the same network they are already on.\n\nHere's a","timestamp":28681},{"type":"message","content":" breakdown of the error and how to fix it:\n\n### The Problem\n\nWhen you're bridging assets from one blockchain","timestamp":28681},{"type":"message","content":" to another (e.g., from Ethereum to Polygon), you need to specify a destination chain.

However, the field of database concurrency control is an active area of research\n within the IEEE community.\n\nHere's a summary of the current landscape and where you can find the latest research:\n\n\n### Key Concepts in Concurrency Control:\n\n*   **Advisory Locks:** These are cooperative locking mechanisms. They are\n not enforced by the database system itself but rely on the cooperating processes to explicitly acquire and release locks. This provides flexibility but requires\n careful application design to avoid conflicts.\n*   **Shared (S-lock) and Exclusive (X-lock) Modes\n:** These are fundamental locking modes. Shared locks allow multiple transactions to read the same data concurrently, while an exclusive lock is\n required for writing and prevents any other transaction from accessing the data.\n*   **Two-Phase Locking (2PL\n):** A protocol that ensures serializability by dividing a transaction's life into a \"growing phase\" (acquiring locks) and\n a \"shrinking phase\" (releasing locks).\n*   **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC\n):** A technique where the database system maintains multiple versions of data to allow readers and writers to operate concurrently without blocking each\n other.\n\n### Upcoming 2025 IEEE Conferences:\n\nThe latest research in this area is likely to be presented at major\n IEEE conferences in 2025. Keep an eye on the publications from these events:\n\n*   **IEEE International Conference\n on Data Engineering (ICDE 2025)**\n*   **IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2025\n**\n*   **IEEE BigData 2025**\n*   **IEEE International Conference on Software Quality\n, Reliability, and Security (QRS 2025)**\n\n### Industry Trends:\n\nIt's also worth\n noting that major database vendors continue to innovate in this space. For example, SQL Server 2025 is introducing\n a feature called \"Optimized Locking\" to improve concurrency management.\n\nWhile a specific advisory from IEEE for 202\n5 is not available, the proceedings from the conferences mentioned above will be the best source for the latest academic research on advisory\n locks and other concurrency control mechanisms.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What is the latest 2025 IEEE research on advisory lock database concurrency control?","timestamp":26714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":26714},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769681884306-cd24514c24dd5","status":"completed","timestamp":26714},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search, there isn't a specific \"202","timestamp":26714},{"type":"message","content":"5 IEEE research advisory\" on advisory lock database concurrency control.

Here are the recommended approaches:\n\n### 1. Using a Single `JSONB\n` Parameter (Most Recommended)\n\nThis is the most flexible and robust method, especially when you have multiple optional parameters. It allows you to\n pass a single JSON object from your client, and you can check for the existence of keys within the object in your PostgreSQL\n function.\n\n**PostgreSQL Function Definition:**\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_pricing_with_over\nrides(params JSONB)\nRETURNS TABLE (\n    product_id UUID,\n    price NUMERIC,\n    override\n_reason TEXT\n)\nLANGUAGE plpgsql\nAS $$\nDECLARE\n    _override_products UUID[];\nBEGIN\n\n    -- Extract optional array of product IDs for pricing overrides\n    IF params ?

Direct Array Parameters with Default Values\n\nFor simpler cases, you can define the array parameter directly in the function signature\n with a default value of `NULL`.\n\n**PostgreSQL Function Definition:**\n\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get\n_pricing_with_overrides_direct(\n    override_products UUID[] DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS TABLE (\n\n    product_id UUID,\n    price NUMERIC,\n    override_reason TEXT\n)\nLANGUAGE plpgsql\n\nAS $$\nBEGIN\n    RETURN QUERY\n    SELECT\n        p.id,\n        CASE\n            WHEN\n override_products IS NOT NULL AND p.id = ANY(override_products) THEN\n                p.price * \n0.9 -- Example: 10% discount\n            ELSE\n                p.price\n        END AS price\n,\n        CASE\n            WHEN override_products IS NOT NULL AND p.id = ANY(override_products)\n THEN\n                'Promotional Discount'\n            ELSE\n                NULL\n        END AS override_reason\n    FROM\n\n        products p\n    WHERE\n        p.is_active = TRUE;\nEND;\n$$;\n\n```\n\n\n**Client-Side Call (JavaScript):**\n\n\n```javascript\n// With pricing overrides\nconst { data, error }\n = await supabase.rpc('get_pricing_with_overrides_direct', {\n  override_products:\n ['product-uuid-1', 'product-uuid-2']\n});\n\n// Without any pricing overrides\nconst\n { data: data2, error: error2 } = await supabase.rpc('get_pricing_with_over\nrides_direct', {});\n\n```\n\n\n### Performance and Security Considerations\n\n*   **Indexing:** If you are filtering based\n on the array parameter, ensure you have appropriate indexes on the columns being queried. For array columns, GIN indexes are generally\n recommended.\n*   **`ANY` Operator:** Use the `= ANY()` operator for checking if a value exists in\n an array. It's efficient and, more importantly, secure against SQL injection, as it uses parameterized queries.\n*\n   **Conditional Logic:** For complex queries with multiple optional parameters, consider using `IF/ELSE` blocks within your PL\n/pgSQL function to construct different queries based on the provided parameters. This can lead to more efficient query plans than a\n single query with multiple `OR` conditions.\n\n### Pricing Overrides and Supabase Costs\n\nThe Supabase pricing model is\n not directly affected by *how* you handle optional array parameters, but rather by the overall usage of the platform. Here'\ns what to keep in mind:\n\n*   **Data Egress:** The size of the array you pass to the RPC\n and the data returned will contribute to your data egress (bandwidth usage). Larger arrays mean more data transfer.\n*   **Compute\n:** The complexity of your RPC function will impact compute resources. More complex logic for handling pricing overrides will consume more CPU and\n memory.\n*   **Edge Function Invocations:** If your RPC is implemented as a Supabase Edge Function, each\n call counts as an invocation.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can create flexible and efficient Supabase RPCs for handling pricing\n overrides with optional array parameters.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","timestamp":54379},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":54379},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769682180331-2c4c9b82c3bd4","status":"completed","timestamp":54379},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769682180353-851a430dbd25e","status":"completed","timestamp":54379},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769682180372-1d448968240ad8","status":"completed","timestamp":54379},{"type":"message","content":"When handling an optional array parameter in a","timestamp":54379},{"type":"message","content":" Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026, the best practices revolve around leveraging PostgreSQL's powerful features for","timestamp":54379},{"type":"message","content":" flexibility, performance, and security.

{"id":"websearch-614","input":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","output":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024\nBased on my research, here are\n the most common reasons why your embedded YouTube videos might not be indexed in Google Search Console in 2024 and how\n you can fix them.\n\n### Key Reasons for Indexing Issues\n\nGoogle's main goal is to index and show\n pages that provide a good user experience and have video as a central part of the content. Here are some of the most\n common reasons why Google may not be indexing your embedded YouTube videos:\n\n*   **The Video Isn't the Main Content\n:** Google is less likely to index a video if it appears to be supplementary to the text on the page.\n*   **Poor\n Video Placement:** Videos hidden at the bottom of the page or in a sidebar are less likely to be seen as important.\n\n*   **Lack of Structured Data:** Without `VideoObject` schema markup, you're not giving Google specific details about your video\n.\n*   **Technical Barriers:** Your site's `robots.txt` file or `noindex` tags\n might be preventing Google from crawling the page where the video is embedded.\n*   **The Page Lacks Focus:** If the page\n's title, description, and surrounding text aren't closely related to the video's topic, Google may not see the\n video as relevant.\n\n### How to Fix These Issues\n\nHere is a list of actionable steps you can take to improve\n the chances of your embedded YouTube videos being indexed:\n\n1.  **Make the Video Prominent**\n    *   \n**Placement is Key:** Position your video \"above the fold\" (visible without scrolling), ideally near the top of the page.\n\n    *   **Create a \"Watch Page\":** For important videos, create a dedicated page where the video is the\n main focus. This sends a strong signal to Google that the page is a \"watch page.\"\n\n2.  **Use\n `VideoObject` Schema Markup**\n    *   **What it is:** `VideoObject` is a type of structured\n data that you add to your page's HTML to give search engines detailed information about your video, such as its title,\n description, duration, and thumbnail URL.\n    *   **How to Implement It:** You can use Google's [\nRich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to help you generate and validate your \n`VideoObject` markup.\n\n3.  **Optimize the Surrounding Content**\n    *   **Relevant Text:** Make sure the\n page's title, meta description, and the text immediately surrounding the video are all highly relevant to the video's content\n.\n    *   **Include a Transcript:** Adding a video transcript not only helps with accessibility but also provides more text for search engines\n to crawl.\n\n4.  **Check for Technical Issues**\n    *   **Google Search Console:** Use the **\nURL Inspection Tool** in Google Search Console to check if the page with the video is being indexed.

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"How to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"How to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026\nTo handle Clerk webhook events for \n`organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted`, you need to create a webhook endpoint in your application\n that listens for these events, verifies their authenticity, and then processes them accordingly.\n\nHere is a step-by-step\n guide:\n\n### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint in Clerk\n1.  Go to your Clerk Dashboard and\n navigate to the \"Webhooks\" page.\n2.  Click \"Add Endpoint\".\n3.  For the \"Endpoint\n URL\", provide a URL from your application that can receive POST requests. For local development, you can use a tool like `ngrok\n` to expose a local URL to the internet.\n4.  In the \"Subscribe to events\" section, select\n `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted`.\n5.  After creating the endpoint, copy\n the \"Signing secret\". You will need this to verify incoming webhooks.\n\n### 2. Create the Webhook Handler\n in Your Application\nIn your application, create a public API route that will handle the incoming webhook POST requests from Clerk. This\n route should not be protected by authentication, as Clerk does not send authentication headers with webhook events.\n\n### 3. Verify\n the Webhook Signature\nIt is critical to verify the signature of every incoming webhook request to ensure it is from Clerk. You\n can use the `svix` library to verify the signature.\n\nHere is an example of how to verify a webhook in\n a Node.js application:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport { Webhook } from 'svix';\nimport { buffer\n } from 'micro';\n\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: false,\n  },\n\n};\n\nconst webhookSecret = process.env.CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET;\n\nexport default async function\n handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method !== 'POST') {\n    return res.\nstatus(405).end();\n  }\n\n  const svix_id = req.headers['svix\n-id'];\n  const svix_timestamp = req.headers['svix-timestamp'];\n  const svix_\nsignature = req.headers['svix-signature'];\n\n  if (!svix_id || !svix_\ntimestamp || !svix_signature) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing sv\nix headers' });\n  }\n\n  const body = (await buffer(req)).toString();\n  const wh = new Web\nhook(webhookSecret);\n\n  let msg;\n  try {\n    msg = wh.verify(body, {\n\n      'svix-id': svix_id,\n      'svix-timestamp': svix_timestamp,\n\n      'svix-signature': svix_signature,\n    });\n  } catch (err) {\n\n    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err);\n    return res.status(400).json({ '\nerror': err.message });\n  }\n\n  const { id } = msg.data;\n  const eventType =\n msg.type;\n\n  console.log(`Received a ${eventType} event for organization ${id}`);\n\n  // Handle\n the event\n  switch (eventType) {\n    case 'organization.created':\n      // Add the organization to your database\n\n      break;\n    case 'organization.updated':\n      // Update the organization in your database\n      break;\n    \ncase 'organization.deleted':\n      // Delete the organization from your database\n      break;\n  }\n\n  \nres.status(200).json({ response: 'Success' });\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Process\n the Events\nOnce you have verified the webhook, you can process the event. The event payload contains a `data` object with the\n organization's details.\n\nA common use case is to keep your application's database in sync with Clerk's data\n. For example:\n*   `organization.created`: Create a new organization record in your database.\n*   \n`organization.updated`: Update an existing organization record in your database.\n*   `organization.deleted`: Delete an\n organization record from your database.\n\nBy following these steps, you can securely and effectively handle Clerk webhook events for organizations in your application.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","timestamp":33596},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":33596},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769682662059-cfcce0ab899d1","status":"completed","timestamp":33596},{"type":"message","content":"To handle Clerk webhook events for ","timestamp":33596},{"type":"message","content":"`organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted`, you need to create a webhook endpoint in your application","timestamp":33596},{"type":"message","content":" that listens for these events, verifies their authenticity, and then processes them accordingly.\n\nHere is a step-by-step","timestamp":33596},{"type":"message","content":" guide:\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-738","input":"How to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026","output":"How to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026\nUsing KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a powerful way\n to automate the creation of type-safe accessors for your localized resources. This guide will walk you through the process, from\n setting up KSP in your project to using it for i18n.\n\n### Why Use KSP for i\n18n?\n\n*   **Type Safety:** Catch errors at compile time, not runtime. No more typos in\n string keys.\n*   **Automation:** Reduces boilerplate code for accessing localized strings.\n*   **Consistency:** En\nforces a single, consistent way to access resources across all platforms.\n*   **Improved Developer Experience:** Better code completion\n and easier refactoring.\n\n### Step 1: Set up KSP in your KMP Project\n\nFirst, you need to\n add the KSP plugin to your project's `build.gradle.kts` files.\n\n1.  **In your\n project's `build.gradle.kts` (the root one):**\n\n    \n```kotlin\n    plugins {\n\n        // ... other plugins\n        id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\") version \"1.9.22\n-1.0.17\" apply false\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **In your shared module\n's `build.gradle.kts`:**\n\n    \n```kotlin\n    plugins {\n        kotlin(\"multiplatform\")\n\n        id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\")\n        // ... other plugins\n    }\n\n    kotlin\n {\n        // ... your targets (jvm, js, android, ios, etc.)\n\n        sourceSets {\n            val\n commonMain by getting {\n                // Add the generated source directory to the commonMain source set\n                kotlin.srcDir\n(\"build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 2: Choose an i18n Library (or Build Your Own)\n\nThere are\n libraries available that use KSP to generate i18n code. One of the most popular is **Moko Resources\n**. It provides a complete solution for managing resources in KMP projects.\n\nFor this guide, we'll walk through a\n conceptual example of how such a library would work, and then we'll touch on how you could build your own K\nSP processor.\n\n### Step 3: Using a KSP-powered i18n Library\n\nLet's imagine\n we're using a hypothetical library called `kmp-i18n-ksp`.\n\n1.  **\nAdd the library dependencies to your shared module's `build.gradle.kts`:**\n\n    \n```kotlin\n    kotlin\n {\n        sourceSets {\n            val commonMain by getting {\n                dependencies {\n                    // The API for\n the library\n                    api(\"com.example:kmp-i18n-ksp-api:1.0.\n0\")\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    dependencies {\n        // The KSP processor\n\n        add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"com.example:kmp-i18n-ksp-processor:\n1.0.0\")\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Create your resource files.**\n\n    These\n would typically be placed in a resources directory in your `commonMain` source set. The format could be JSON, XML\n, or another format supported by the library.\n\n    `commonMain/resources/i18n/en.\njson`:\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"hello_world\": \"Hello, World!\",\n      \"greeting\n\": \"Hello, {name}!\"\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n    `commonMain/resources/i1\n8n/es.json`:\n    \n```json\n    {\n      \"hello_world\": \"¡Hola, Mundo!\",\n\n      \"greeting\": \"¡Hola, {name}!\"\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **\nBuild your project.**\n\n    The KSP processor will run and generate code based on your resource files. The generated code might\n look something like this:\n\n    `build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin/com/example/i\n18n/Strings.kt`:\n    \n```kotlin\n    package com.example.i18n\n\n    import\n kotlin.String\n\n    public object Strings {\n      public val hello_world: String\n        get() = //\n ... platform-specific code to get the localized string\n\n      public fun greeting(name: String): String = // ... platform\n-specific code\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n4.  **Use the generated code in `commonMain`:**\n\n\n    \n```kotlin\n    import com.example.i18n.Strings\n\n    fun getGreeting(name\n: String): String {\n        return Strings.greeting(name)\n    }\n\n    fun getHelloWorld(): String {\n\n        return Strings.hello_world\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### Step 4: Creating Your Own KSP Processor\n (Advanced)\n\nIf you want to create your own i18n KSP processor, here's a high\n-level overview of the steps involved:\n\n1.  **Create a new Kotlin module for your KSP processor.**\n This module will contain your KSP `SymbolProcessor` and `SymbolProcessorProvider`.\n2.  **Define your resource format\n.** Decide whether you'll use JSON, XML, or another format for your string resources.\n3.  **Implement\n the `SymbolProcessor`**.\n    *   In the `process` method, you'll get a `Resolver\n` instance.\n    *   Use the `Resolver` to find your resource files (you might need to use standard file\n I/O for this, as KSP is primarily for processing Kotlin code).\n    *   Parse the resource files.\n\n    *   Use a code generation library like KotlinPoet to generate the Kotlin source files for your type-safe access\nors.\n4.  **Implement the `SymbolProcessorProvider`**. This is a simple factory class that creates an\n instance of your `SymbolProcessor`.\n5.  **Register your processor.** Create a file in `src/main/resources\n/META-INF/services/com.google.devtools.ksp.processing.SymbolProcessorProvider` and add\n the fully qualified name of your `SymbolProcessorProvider` to it.\n\nThis is a simplified overview. Creating a robust KSP\n processor requires a good understanding of KSP APIs and code generation.\n\nBy using KSP for i18n,\n you can create a more robust and maintainable internationalization system in your Kotlin Multiplatform projects.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026","timestamp":46117},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":46117},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769682752683-e58d8127f03c7","status":"completed","timestamp":46117},{"type":"message","content":"Using KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a powerful way","timestamp":46117},{"type":"message","content":" to automate the creation of type-safe accessors for your localized resources.

These techniques will focus on providing clear, context-rich, and multi-faceted instructions to the\n AI. Here are the key techniques:\n\n### 1. **Multimodal Prompts: Combining Text and Visuals**\nThe\n most effective approach involves combining textual instructions with visual cues directly in the prompt.\n\n*   **Textual Instructions:** Be\n highly specific. Instead of \"find tumors,\" a better prompt is, \"Identify and draw bounding boxes around all suspected malignant\n nodules in the upper lobe of the right lung in this CT scan.\"\n*   **Visual Prompts:** Incorporate\n visual hints in the image itself. This could be arrows pointing to regions of interest, circles around subtle abnormalities, or even\n example bounding boxes. This helps to ground the model's attention.\n\n### 2. **Chain-of-Thought\n and Step-by-Step Reasoning**\nBreak down complex diagnostic tasks into a logical sequence within the prompt. This forces\n the model to follow a more rigorous, human-like reasoning process, which improves accuracy.\n\n*   **Example:**\n \"For this chest X-ray, first, identify the lung fields. Second, examine the cardiac silhouette for any enlargement\n. Third, inspect the lung parenchyma for infiltrates or nodules, and place bounding boxes around any findings.\"\n\n### 3\n. **Providing Rich Context**\nMedical image analysis is not done in a vacuum. Providing clinical context within the prompt can significantly\n improve detection accuracy.\n\n*   **Example:** \"Patient is a 65-year-old male with a\n history of smoking, presenting with a persistent cough. Please analyze the provided chest CT for any signs of lung cancer, such as solid\n or subsolid nodules, and mark them with bounding boxes.\"\n\n### 4. **Negative Prompting and Constraints**\nTo\n reduce false positives, it's crucial to tell the model what *not* to look for, especially when dealing with common benign\n structures that can be mistaken for pathology.\n\n*   **Example:** \"Detect and bound any suspicious microcalcifications.\n Do not include benign vascular calcifications in the results.\"\n\n### 5. **Structured Output and Zero-Shot B\nounding Box Generation**\nVertex AI's Gemini models can generate structured outputs like bounding box coordinates without needing to be ret\nrained on a custom dataset. Your prompt should be designed to elicit this specific format.\n\n*   **Vertex AI Specific\ns:** You can provide an image and a text prompt like, \"Show me bounding boxes for all the surgical instruments in this image\n,\" and the model will output the coordinates, typically in a normalized `[y_min, x_min, y\n_max, x_max]` format.\n\n### Future Trends for 2026 and Beyond:\n\n*   **3\nD and Volumetric Analysis:** With the rise of models capable of processing 3D data (like Google's CT Foundation\n), prompts will evolve to guide analysis through entire volumetric scans (e.g., \"Analyze this 3D CT volume\n slice by slice and create bounding boxes for any lesions found in the liver\").\n*   **Agentic Vision and Automated\n Analysis:** By 2026, AI models will be more \"agentic.\" You can expect to provide a high\n-level goal, and the model will formulate its own plan, which might involve scanning, zooming, and counting objects with\n bounding boxes as part of its process.\n*   **Longitudinal Analysis:** Prompts will increasingly involve comparing current images to\n prior scans to detect changes over time.

The primary types of insets to consider are:\n\n*   **System Bar\n Insets:** For the status bar at the top and the navigation bar at the bottom. These should be used to pad tapp\nable views to prevent them from being hidden.\n*   **System Gesture Insets:** These define the areas where system gestures\n (like the back gesture) take priority. Use these insets to move or pad views to avoid gesture conflicts.\n*\n   **IME (Input Method Editor) Insets:** To adjust the UI when the on-screen keyboard is visible.\n\n###\n 3. Implementation in Jetpack Compose and Views\n\n**Jetpack Compose:**\n\n*   **`Scaffold`:**\n Use the `Scaffold` composable as it provides a structure for handling insets.\n*   **Material \n3 Components:** Many Material 3 components like `TopAppBar`, `BottomAppBar`, and `NavigationBar` automatically handle in\nsets.\n*   **`Modifier.windowInsetsPadding()` and `Modifier.safeDrawingPadding()`:** Use these modifiers to apply\n padding to your composables to avoid overlapping with system UI.\n\n**Views:**\n\n*   **`AppBarLayout`:**\n Wrap `MaterialToolbar` with `AppBarLayout` to correctly handle insets.\n*   **Avoid `android:fitsSystemWindows\n`:** Do not use `android:fitsSystemWindows=\"true\"` in your XML layouts. Instead, handle insets program\nmatically.\n\n### 4. Handling Gesture Conflicts\n\nFor applications that have their own swipe gestures near the edges of the screen,\n it's important to avoid conflicts with the system's back gesture.\n\n*   **Gesture Exclusion Rects:**\n Use `View.setSystemGestureExclusionRects()` to inform the system about areas where your app's gestures\n should take precedence. This should be used sparingly to maintain a consistent user experience.\n\n### 5. Best Practices Summary\n\n\n*   **Go Edge-to-Edge:** Ensure your app displays content behind the system bars.\n*   **\nHandle Insets:** Use the appropriate inset types to pad your UI and avoid visual conflicts.\n*   **Use Modern\n APIs:** Leverage Jetpack Compose and Material 3 for simpler inset handling.\n*   **Avoid Gesture Conflicts:** Use\n gesture exclusion rects when necessary.\n*   **Test Thoroughly:** Test your app on various devices and Android versions to\n ensure a consistent and usable experience.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets?","timestamp":40069},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":40069},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769683177205-a20e470f3add18","status":"completed","timestamp":40069},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769683177223-229460eebec558","status":"completed","timestamp":40069},{"type":"message","content":"The 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset","timestamp":40069},{"type":"message","content":" handling and navigation bar gesture insets are centered around creating immersive, edge-to-edge experiences by default.

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"how to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"how to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026\nPyTorch can experience deadlocks when loading models in\n a multiprocessing context, especially on Linux-based systems. This is a long-standing issue that is not expected to be resolved\n by any particular year, including 2026. The root cause is often related to the default `fork` start method\n for creating new processes, which can lead to conflicts with libraries like OpenMP and CUDA.\n\nHere are the common causes and how\n to fix them:\n\n### 1. Change the Multiprocessing Start Method\n\nThe most common cause of deadlocks is\n the `fork` start method. Child processes inherit the state of the parent, which can lead to corrupted states and deadlocks,\n especially when using CUDA.\n\n**Solution:** Explicitly set the start method to `spawn` or `forkserver` at the\n beginning of your script. This ensures that child processes start fresh and don't inherit problematic states.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\n.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Use 'spawn' or 'forkserver'\n to avoid deadlocks\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n\n    # Your\n code to load the model and run multiprocessing tasks\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Manage OpenMP Threads\n\nPyTorch's use\n of OpenMP for CPU operations can conflict with multiprocessing, leading to deadlocks or reduced performance.\n\n**Solution:** Set the\n number of OpenMP threads to 1 in your worker processes.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef worker_function\n():\n    # Set the number of threads to 1 to avoid conflicts\n    torch.set_num_threads(\n1)\n    \n    # Your model loading and processing code here\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    # ...

Best\n Practices for `DataLoader`\n\nIf you are using `DataLoader` with `num_workers > 0`, deadlocks can occur if\n the CUDA runtime is initialized in the main process before the workers are forked.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n*   Always use the\n `spawn` or `forkserver` start method when using `DataLoader` with multiple workers, especially when working with GPUs.\n\n*   Ensure that dataset initialization that might involve non-fork-safe operations occurs within the worker processes.\n\n### 4\n. Efficiently Share Models\n\nIf you need to share a model across multiple processes, you can use `model.share_memory\n()` to avoid creating redundant copies and potential deadlocks.\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n\nclass MyModel(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(MyModel,\n self).__init__()\n        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)\n\n    def\n forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(x)\n\ndef worker(model):\n    # Use\n the shared model\n    print(f\"Worker process using shared model: {model.linear.weight}\")\n\nif __name\n__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n\n    model\n = MyModel()\n    # Share the model's parameters across processes\n    model.share_memory()\n\n    processes\n = []\n    for _ in range(4):\n        p = mp.Process(target=worker, args\n=(model,))\n        p.start()\n        processes.append(p)\n\n    for p in processes:\n\n        p.join()\n\n```\n\n\nBy following these best practices, you can avoid the common pitfalls that lead to deadlocks\n when using PyTorch with multiprocessing.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","timestamp":33309},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":33309},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769683542510-cc9808ea8c2c3","status":"completed","timestamp":33309},{"type":"message","content":"PyTorch can experience deadlocks when loading models in","timestamp":33309},{"type":"message","content":" a multiprocessing context, especially on Linux-based systems.

Here are some of the most significant techniques:\n\n### 1. Gradient-Alignment-Based Data\n Selection\n\nA novel approach is to select data based on how well it aligns with the model's learning gradient. The\n **LearnAlign** method, for instance, identifies \"learnable and representative\" data points that are most effective at reducing the model'\ns loss. This technique significantly reduces the amount of data required for training while maintaining or even improving performance.\n\n### \n2. Active Learning and LLM-Driven Data Selection\n\nLLMs are now being used not just as the model being trained, but\n also as a tool for selecting the data itself. In active learning frameworks, LLMs use their in-context reasoning and few\n-shot learning capabilities to assess the uncertainty and diversity of data. This allows them to select the most informative instances for training.\n Techniques like **ActiveLLM** and **ActivePrune** leverage LLMs to prune unlabeled data and refine few-shot demonstrations\n, making the data selection process more intelligent and efficient.\n\n### 3. Adaptive Curriculum Learning\n\nTo optimize the training process,\n **Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL)** has gained traction. This strategy dynamically adjusts the difficulty of the training data to match\n the LLM's current capabilities. By re-estimating the difficulty of problems within data batches, ADCL addresses the \"\nDifficulty Shift\" phenomenon, where the model's perception of what is difficult changes as it learns. This ensures the model is always learning\n from data that is challenging but not overwhelmingly so.\n\n### 4. Synthetic Data Generation and Multi-Step Reinforcement Learning\n\nWith\n the high cost and time involved in human annotation, synthetic data generation has become a key area of research. Techniques like **Step\n-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL)** are being used to iteratively generate multi-step reasoning and tool-use data.\n The model then learns from these generated trajectories. This is a shift from single-step optimization to addressing more complex, multi-\nstep reasoning tasks by providing more granular, step-wise feedback.\n\n### 5. Refined Reward Functions and Cross-Domain General\nization\n\nThe design of the reward function is critical in RL. In addition to rule-based reward functions (e.g.,\n correctness on a math problem), researchers are exploring more nuanced reward functions, such as cosine-shaped rewards, to better control the length\n of the output and improve training consistency. There is also a focus on creating high-quality, multi-domain datasets to\n improve the cross-domain transferability of LLMs.\n\n### 6. Data Quality and Cleaning\n\nFinally, there is a\n renewed emphasis on the fundamental importance of high-quality data. This includes techniques for quality filtering, data cleaning, and the\n detection and removal of personally identifiable information (PII). Heuristic filters are being used to remove low-quality or repetitive content, and\n there is a focus on excluding machine-generated text that lacks true diversity.\n\nThese advancements are helping to make the process\n of training LLMs with reinforcement learning more efficient, effective, and scalable.

Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.\n\n2.  Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.\n\n### 2. Create Two Versions\n of Your Extension\n\nFirst, I'll create the directories and files for two different versions of a sample extension.\n\n\nI will now create the necessary directories (`v1` and `v2`) and the manifest/background script files for each version\n.\nOf course. Testing Chrome extension permission warnings locally is a process of simulating an update. You create two packed\n versions of your extension—an old one with fewer permissions and a new one with more. The year 2026\n doesn't change this process, which is a standard part of extension development.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide\n:\n\n### 1. Enable Developer Mode\nFirst, you need to enable Developer Mode in Chrome:\n1.  \nNavigate to `chrome://extensions`.\n2.  In the top-right corner, turn on the **Developer mode\n** switch.\n\n### 2. Create Two Versions of Your Extension\nNext, you will need to create two folders\n, `v1` and `v2`, to hold the two versions of your extension.\n\n**Version 1 (\nThe \"Old\" Version)**\nCreate a directory named `v1`. Inside `v1`, create two files:\n\n\n`v1/manifest.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Permission Test\",\n  \"\nversion\": \"1.0\",\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"background\": {\n    \"service\n_worker\": \"background.js\"\n  },\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"storage\"\n  \n]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n`v1/background.js`\n\n```javascript\n// A simple background script\n\nconsole.log(\"Version 1.0 installed.\");\n\n```\n\n\n**Version 2 (The \"New\" Updated\n Version)**\nCreate a second directory named `v2`. Inside `v2`, create these two files. Notice the version\n number is higher and we've added `\"activeTab\"` and `\"scripting\"` to the permissions list.\n\n\n`v2/manifest.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Permission Test\",\n  \"\nversion\": \"2.0\",\n  \"manifest_version\": 3,\n  \"background\": {\n\n    \"service_worker\": \"background.js\"\n  },\n  \"permissions\": [\n    \"storage\n\",\n    \"activeTab\",\n    \"scripting\"\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n`v2/background\n.js`\n\n```javascript\n// A simple background script\nconsole.log(\"Version 2.0 installed.\");\n\n\n```\n\n\n### 3. Pack and Install Version 1\n1.  Go back to the `chrome://extensions\n` page.\n2.  Click the **Pack extension** button.\n3.  For the \"Extension root\n directory,\" select your `v1` folder.\n4.  Leave the \"Private key file\" field blank for\n the first packing.\n5.  Click **Pack extension**.\n6.  Chrome will create `v1.\ncrx` and `v1.pem` (your private key) in the directory containing `v1`. **\nKeep the `.pem` file safe; you'll need it to pack version 2.**\n7.  Drag and\n drop the newly created `v1.crx` file onto the `chrome://extensions` page to install it.\n\n###\n 4. Pack and \"Update\" with Version 2\nNow, you simulate the update:\n1.  \nClick the **Pack extension** button again.\n2.  For the \"Extension root directory,\" select your `v2` folder\n.\n3.  For the \"Private key file,\" browse and select the `v1.pem` file that was generated\n in the previous step. This is crucial—it tells Chrome that `v2` is an update to an existing extension.\n\n4.  Click **Pack extension**. This will create `v2.crx`.\n5.  Drag and\n drop `v2.crx` onto the `chrome://extensions` page.\n\nBecause you are installing an update (\n`version: \"2.0\"`) signed with the same key but with new permissions, Chrome will now display the permission warning dialog\n, asking you to accept the new permissions (`activeTab` and `scripting`). The extension will be disabled until you accept\n. This is exactly what a user would see when your extension updates from the Chrome Web Store.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I test chrome extension permission warning updates locally by packing the extension in 2026?","timestamp":48735},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":48735},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769683803173-366d30e6f2d26","status":"completed","timestamp":48735},{"type":"message","content":"Testing Chrome extension permission warnings locally","timestamp":48735},{"type":"message","content":" involves creating two versions of your extension: an old version with fewer permissions and a new version with added permissions.

HTML Structure\n\nFirst, create a basic HTML file (`index.html`) to define the text element you want to\n style.\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <\nmeta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial\n-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>CSS Background-Clip Text Effect</title>\n    <link rel\n=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1 class=\"clipped-\ntext\">HOVER ME</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. CSS Styling\n\nNext, create a\n CSS file (`style.css`) to apply the styling for the text and the hover effect.\n\n\n```css\nbody {\n\n    background-color: #111;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center\n;\n    align-items: center;\n    min-height: 100vh;\n    margin\n: 0;\n}\n\n.clipped-text {\n    font-size: 10rem;\n\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    position: relative\n;\n    background: linear-gradient(45deg, #ff8a00, #e52\ne71);\n    -webkit-background-clip: text;\n    background-clip: text;\n\n    color: transparent;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    transition: color 0.5s ease-in\n-out;\n}\n\n.clipped-text::before {\n    content: '';\n    position: absolute;\n    top\n: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    bottom: 0\n;\n    background: radial-gradient(circle at center, rgba(255, 255,\n 255, 0.5) 0%, rgba(255, 255,\n 255, 0) 80%);\n    opacity: 0;\n    transition: opacity\n 0.5s ease-in-out;\n    pointer-events: none;\n}\n\n.clipped\n-text:hover::before {\n    opacity: 1;\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### How It Works\n\n1.\n  **`background-clip: text`**: This property is the core of the effect. It clips the element's background to\n the shape of the text. The `-webkit-` prefix is included for maximum browser compatibility. To make the background visible, the \n`color` of the text is set to `transparent`.\n\n2.  **Radial Gradient Overlay**:\n    *   \nA `::before` pseudo-element is used to create the overlay. It's positioned to cover the text completely.\n\n    *   The `background` of the pseudo-element is a `radial-gradient` that transitions from a semi\n-transparent white at the center to fully transparent at the edges.\n    *   By default, the `opacity` of this\n pseudo-element is `0`, so it's hidden.\n\n3.  **Hover Effect**:\n    *   When\n the `.clipped-text` element is hovered over, the `opacity` of the `::before` pseudo-element\n is smoothly transitioned to `1`, revealing the radial gradient and creating the overlay effect.\n    *   `pointer-events:\n none;` is applied to the pseudo-element to ensure that it doesn't interfere with mouse events, allowing you to still select\n the text if needed.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to use CSS background-clip text with a radial gradient overlay hover effect in 2026?","timestamp":23181},{"type":"tool_call","name":"write_file","status":"pending","timestamp":23181},{"type":"tool_call","name":"write_file-1769683865897-650e2ed228075","status":"completed","timestamp":23181},{"type":"tool_call","name":"write_file-1769683867863-9a2a12cc169c98","status":"completed","timestamp":23181},{"type":"message","content":"To use CSS `background-clip: text` with","timestamp":23181},{"type":"message","content":" a radial gradient overlay hover effect, you can follow these steps.

{"id":"websearch-1041","input":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","output":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?\nBased on the search results, here are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors\n in `govulncheck` and how to resolve them in 2026:\n\n### Common Causes and\n Resolutions:\n\n**1. Outdated Go Toolchain Version:**\n\n*   **Cause:** `govulncheck\n` itself may have minimum Go version requirements. Running an older Go toolchain might lead to errors or incomplete vulnerability scans. Additionally\n, older Go versions often contain known vulnerabilities within the Go standard library, which `govulncheck` will report.\n*   \n**Resolution:** Always use the latest stable version of Go. This ensures `govulncheck` operates optimally and that\n your project benefits from the most recent security patches in the Go standard library. You can update your Go installation and then install\n or update `govulncheck` using `go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/\ngovulncheck@latest`.\n\n**2. Mismatch Between `go.mod` and Installed Go Version:**\n\n*\n   **Cause:** The `go` directive in your `go.mod` file specifies the minimum Go version required for your module\n. If the Go version installed on your system is older than the one specified in `go.mod`, you might encounter build\n issues or `govulncheck` might report vulnerabilities that are already fixed in newer Go versions.\n*   **Resolution\n:** Ensure that your installed Go version is equal to or newer than the version specified in your `go.mod` file. After\n updating your Go version, run `go mod tidy` to ensure dependencies are up to date.\n\n**3. \n`govulncheck` Using an Unexpected Go Version for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Cause:** `govulncheck` uses\n the `go` command found on your system's `PATH` to determine the Go version for analysis. If you\n have multiple Go versions installed and your `PATH` points to an older or unintended version, `govulncheck` might report vulnerabilities\n relevant to that older Go version, even if your project is built with a newer one.\n*   **Resolution:** Explicit\nly control the Go version used by `govulncheck` by manipulating your `PATH` environment variable. You can prepend the\n `bin` directory of your desired Go installation to the `PATH` before running `govulncheck`.\n\n**4\n. `govulncheck` Operating in `GOPATH` Mode or with a `vendor` Folder:**\n\n*   \n**Cause:** `govulncheck` is designed to work with Go modules. If your project is still in `GOPATH\n` mode or if a `vendor` folder is present and causing conflicts, `govulncheck` might not detect\n vulnerabilities correctly or might produce confusing output.\n*   **Resolution:** Ensure your project is properly initialized as a Go module by\n running `go mod init`. `govulncheck` works best when Go modules are the primary dependency management mechanism. If\n you encounter issues with a `vendor` folder, try deleting it and running `go mod tidy` to regenerate the module\n graph.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors in govulncheck and how to resolve them in 2026?","timestamp":29281},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":29281},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769683930626-12e755b21a34e8","status":"completed","timestamp":29281},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here are the common causes of Go version compatibility errors","timestamp":29281},{"type":"message","content":" in `govulncheck` and how to resolve them in 2026:\n\n### Common Causes and","timestamp":29281},{"type":"message","content":" Resolutions:\n\n**1.

Create\n a `manifest.json` file in your project's root directory:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\n\": \"Your Web App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"WebApp\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"theme_color\n\": \"#000000\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"icon\n-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"icon-\n512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\nLink to it\n in the `<head>` of your `index.html`:\n\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/\nmanifest.json\">\n\n```\n\n\n**Step 3: Create and Register a Service Worker**\n\nThe service worker is a\n JavaScript file that runs in the background and handles push notifications.\n\nCreate a `service-worker.js` file in your\n root directory:\n\n\n```javascript\n// service-worker.js\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n\n  const data = event.data.json();\n  const options = {\n    body: data.body,\n    \nicon: 'icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: 'badge-72x7\n2.png'\n  };\n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(data.title, options\n)\n  );\n});\n\n```\n\n\nRegister the service worker in your main JavaScript file:\n\n\n```javascript\nif\n ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')\n    \n.then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);\n    })\n    \n.catch(error => {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n**Step 4: Implement Push Notification Subscription Logic**\n\nIn your frontend JavaScript, add the logic to ask\n for permission and subscribe the user to push notifications.\n\n1.  **Generate VAPID Keys:** VAPID (Vol\nuntary Application Server Identification) keys are used to identify your application server to the push service. You only need to generate these\n once. You can use an online tool or a library like `web-push` for Node.js:\n\n    \n```bash\n\n    npx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n    \n```\n\n\n    This will give you a public and a\n private key. The **public key** is used in your frontend code, and the **private key** is used on\n your backend.\n\n2.  **Subscription Logic:**\n\n    \n```javascript\n    // In your main JavaScript file\n    \nconst vapidPublicKey = 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY';\n\n    function urlBase64ToUint\n8Array(base64String) {\n      const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length\n % 4) % 4);\n      const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n        \n.replace(/-/g, '+')\n        .replace(/_/g, '/');\n\n      const rawData = window\n.atob(base64);\n      const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n\n\n      for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n        outputArray\n[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n      }\n      return outputArray;\n    }\n\n    async\n function subscribeUser() {\n      try {\n        const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n        const\n subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n          userVisibleOnly: true,\n          applicationServerKey: url\nBase64ToUint8Array(vapidPublicKey)\n        });\n\n        // Send the subscription object to your backend\n\n        await fetch('/api/subscribe', {\n          method: 'POST',\n          body: JSON.stringify\n(subscription),\n          headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n          }\n\n        });\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Failed to subscribe the user: ', error);\n\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Add a button to your HTML to trigger the subscription\n    // <button id=\"\nsubscribeBtn\">Subscribe to Notifications</button>\n    document.getElementById('subscribeBtn').addEventListener('click', () => {\n      \nNotification.requestPermission().then(permission => {\n        if (permission === 'granted') {\n          subscribeUser();\n\n        }\n      });\n    });\n    \n```\n\n\n**Step 5: Set Up Your Backend to Send Push Notifications**\n\n\nYour backend will store the user subscriptions and send push messages. Here's a conceptual example using the `web-push\n` library for Node.js:\n\n1.  **Install `web-push`:**\n\n    \n```bash\n\n    npm install web-push\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Backend Logic:**\n\n    \n```javascript\n    // server.\njs\n    const webpush = require('web-push');\n    const express = require('express');\n    const bodyParser\n = require('body-parser');\n\n    const app = express();\n    app.use(bodyParser.json());\n\n    const\n vapidKeys = {\n      publicKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY',\n      privateKey: 'YOUR\n_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY'\n    };\n\n    webpush.setVapidDetails(\n\n      'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n      vapidKeys.publicKey,\n      vapidKeys\n.privateKey\n    );\n\n    // In a real app, you would save this to a database\n    let\n subscriptions = [];\n\n    app.post('/api/subscribe', (req, res) => {\n      const subscription = req\n.body;\n      subscriptions.push(subscription);\n      res.status(201).json({});\n    });\n\n\n    app.post('/api/send-notification', (req, res) => {\n      const notificationPayload = {\n        \ntitle: 'New Notification',\n        body: 'This is a push notification!'\n      };\n\n      const promises = subscriptions.\nmap(subscription =>\n        webpush.sendNotification(subscription, JSON.stringify(notificationPayload))\n      );\n\n\n      Promise.all(promises)\n        .then(() => res.sendStatus(200))\n        .catch(err\n => {\n          console.error(\"Error sending notification, reason: \", err);\n          res.sendStatus(500\n);\n        });\n    });\n\n    const port = 3000;\n    app.listen(port,\n () => {\n      console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);\n    });\n    \n```\n\n\nBy following these steps\n, you can implement web push notifications for Safari on iOS 16.4 and later, providing a more engaging experience\n for your users who have added your web app to their Home Screen.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":52643},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":52643},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769684052513-26a6d5f0544178","status":"completed","timestamp":52643},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769684052532-3433802c3d8b7","status":"completed","timestamp":52643},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769684052550-a71e2f6b16e7e","status":"completed","timestamp":52643},{"type":"message","content":"Setting up web push notifications","timestamp":52643},{"type":"message","content":" for web apps on Apple Safari for iOS 16.4 and later is possible, but it requires a specific setup","timestamp":52643},{"type":"message","content":" using the \"Add to Home Screen\" feature.

{"id":"websearch-1075","input":"How to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?","output":"How to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?\nGitHub\n Desktop is a user-friendly application that allows you to interact with GitHub using a graphical\n interface, which is great for those who are not comfortable with the command line. Here is a guide for beginners:\n\n###\n 1. Install and Set Up\n- **Create a GitHub Account**: Before you do anything else, you'll need a\n free account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com).\n- **Download GitHub Desktop**: You can download it for\n free from the [official website](https://desktop.github.com).\n- **Log in**: After downloading and\n installing the application, you'll need to log in with your GitHub account credentials to connect the application to your online account.\n\n###\n 2. Basic Terminology\n- **Repository (or \"Repo\")**: This is a folder for your project. It\n contains all of your project's files and the entire revision history.\n- **Clone**: This means to copy a\n repository from GitHub.com to your computer.\n- **Commit**: This is the action of saving your changes. Each\n time you commit, you create a snapshot of your files at that point in time. It is important to write a descriptive message\n for each commit so you know what changes were made.\n- **Push**: This uploads your committed changes from your computer\n to your repository on GitHub.com.\n- **Branch**: This is a parallel version of your repository. It allows you to work\n on changes without affecting the main version of your project, which is often called the \"main\" or \"master\" branch.\n\n\n### 3. Common Workflows\n- **Cloning a Repository**:\n  - In GitHub Desktop, go to\n `File > Clone Repository`.\n  - You'll see a list of your repositories on GitHub.com. Select\n the one you want to work on.\n  - Choose a location on your computer where you'd like to save\n the files.\n- **Making Changes**:\n  - Open the files in your preferred editor (it doesn't have\n to be a code editor).\n  - Make any changes you want and save the files.\n  - GitHub Desktop will\n automatically detect any changes you've made.\n- **Committing and Pushing**:\n  - In GitHub Desktop, you\n will see a list of the files you've changed.\n  - At the bottom, there will be a box\n to type a commit message. Write a short, descriptive summary of the changes you've made.\n  - Click \n`Commit to main` (or the name of your branch).\n  - To upload your changes to GitHub.com, click\n the `Push origin` button at the top of the application.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use GitHub Desktop to manage\n your projects without needing to use the command line.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to use GitHub Desktop for absolute beginners who aren't programmers in 2024?","timestamp":22383},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":22383},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769684176724-2f11e6a6a92a08","status":"completed","timestamp":22383},{"type":"message","content":"GitHub","timestamp":22383},{"type":"message","content":" Desktop is a user-friendly application that allows you to interact with GitHub using a graphical","timestamp":22383},{"type":"message","content":" interface, which is great for those who are not comfortable with the command line.

Here are the common causes of 500 internal server errors in REST\n API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026.\n\n### Common Causes of 500 Errors\n\n\nA 500 internal server error is a general-purpose error that indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented\n it from fulfilling the request. Here are some of the most common causes:\n\n*   **Unhandled exceptions in code**:\n This is the most frequent cause. If the API code doesn't gracefully handle errors, any unexpected issue can result in a 5\n00 error.\n*   **Database errors**: The database may be unavailable, the query may be malformed, or the\n connection may be refused.\n*   **Failed connections to other services**: If the API relies on other microservices or third\n-party APIs, any failure in those services can cascade and cause a 500 error.\n*   **\nConfiguration issues**: Incorrect database credentials, invalid API keys for other services, or other misconfigurations can lead to 500 errors\n.\n*   **Resource exhaustion**: The server may be running out of memory or CPU, which can cause the application\n to crash.\n*   **Invalid request payloads**: While this should ideally result in a 4xx error, sometimes\n a malformed request can trigger an unhandled exception on the server.\n\n### How to Debug 500 Errors in\n 2026\n\nBy 2026, we can expect debugging to be more automated and intelligent.\n Here are some of the methods and tools you can expect to use:\n\n*   **AI-powered observability platforms**: Tools\n like Datadog, and Splunk will have more advanced AI capabilities. They will be able to:\n    *   **Autom\nated root cause analysis**: The platform will analyze logs, traces, and metrics to pinpoint the exact line of code or configuration\n that is causing the error.\n    *   **Anomaly detection**: The platform will be able to detect unusual patterns in your\n application's behavior and alert you to potential problems before they cause 500 errors.\n    *   **Predict\nive analytics**: The platform will be able to predict when a service is likely to fail based on historical data.\n*   \n**Distributed tracing**: This is already a common practice, but it will be even more important in 2026. Distributed\n tracing allows you to see the entire lifecycle of a request as it travels through different services. This makes it easy to identify which\n service is failing and causing the 500 error.\n*   **Chaos engineering**: This is the practice of intentionally\n injecting failures into your system to see how it responds. This can help you to identify and fix weaknesses in your system before they cause problems\n in production.\n*   **Dynamic logging and instrumentation**: This will allow you to add logging statements and other instrumentation to your code\n without having to redeploy it. This can be very useful for debugging problems in production.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?","timestamp":34438},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":34438},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769684213323-15ae4ad21b0258","status":"completed","timestamp":34438},{"type":"message","content":"Of","timestamp":34438},{"type":"message","content":" course.

Install dependencies\n in the `ui` package\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add -D tailwindcss@\nlatest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge luc\nide-react @radix-ui/react-slot\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Initialize shadcn/ui\n in the `ui` package\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init\n```\n\nYou\n will be asked a few questions. Here are the recommended answers for a monorepo setup:\n- **Would you like to use\n TypeScript (recommended)?** Yes\n- **Which style would you like to use?** Default\n- **Which color\n would you like to use as base color?** Slate\n- **Use CSS variables for colors?** Yes\n- **Where\n is your global CSS file?** `src/styles/globals.css`\n- **Where is your `tailwind.config.\njs` located?** `tailwind.config.ts`\n- **Configure the import alias for components:** `@/components`\n\n- **Configure the import alias for utils:** `@/lib/utils`\n- **Are you using React Server Components\n?** Yes\n\n### 5. Configure the `ui` package to be exported\nAdd an `exports` field\n to your `packages/ui/package.json` to define how other packages can import from your `ui` package.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"@repo/ui\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0\n.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./globals.css\": \"./\nsrc/styles/globals.css\",\n    \"./postcss.config\": \"./postcss.config.mjs\",\n    \n\"./lib/*\": \"./src/lib/*.ts\",\n    \"./components/*\": \"./src/components/*.tsx\",\n    \"./\nhooks/*\": \"./src/hooks/*.ts\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\":\n \"eslint . --max-warnings 0\",\n    \"generate:component\": \"turbo gen react-component\"\n\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@repo/eslint-config\": \"workspace:*\",\n    \"@repo/\ntypescript-config\": \"workspace:*\",\n    \"@turbo/gen\": \"^1.12.4\",\n    \"@\ntypes/node\": \"^20.11.24\",\n    \"@types/eslint\": \"^8.\n56.5\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^18.2.61\",\n    \"@\ntypes/react-dom\": \"^18.2.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8.57\n.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18.2.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.3.3\n\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\nMake sure your `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` includes path aliases.\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@repo/typescript-config/react-library.json\",\n  \"\ncompilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@workspace/ui/*\": [\"\n./src/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\".\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\",\n \"dist\"]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 6. Integrate the `ui` package into your application\nIn your Next\n.js application (e.g., `apps/web`), you need to configure it to use the shared `ui\n` package.\n\nAdd the `ui` package as a dependency in `apps/web/package.json`:\n\n```json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"web\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"private\": true\n,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \n\"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\":\n {\n    \"@repo/ui\": \"workspace:*\",\n    \"next\": \"^14.1.1\n\",\n    \"react\": \"^18.2.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\n.2.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@next/eslint-plugin-next\": \"^\n14.1.1\",\n    \"@repo/eslint-config\": \"workspace:*\",\n    \"@repo/typescript-\nconfig\": \"workspace:*\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20.11.24\",\n    \"@\ntypes/react\": \"^18.2.61\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18.2\n.19\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^8.57.0\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\n.3.3\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\nUpdate `apps/web/tsconfig.json` to\n include path aliases for the shared `ui` package.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@repo/typescript\n-config/nextjs.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\n\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"],\n      \"@repo/ui/*\": [\"../../packages/ui/\nsrc/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"next-env.d.ts\", \"**\n/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n\n```\n\n\nImport the \n`postcss.config` from your `ui` package in `apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`.\n\n```javascript\nexport { default } from \"@repo/ui/postcss.config\";\n```\n\n\nEnsure your application's `tailwind\n.config.ts` is configured to scan for Tailwind classes in your `ui` package.\n\n```javascript\nimport type\n { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  content: [\n    \"./app/**/*.{\njs,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}\",\n    \"./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,\nmdx}\",\n    \"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}\",\n    \"../../packages\n/ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}\"\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend\n: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n};\nexport default config;\n\n```\n\n\nImport the global CSS from your\n `ui` package in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`.\n\n```typescript\nimport \"@repo/ui/\nglobals.css\";\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.\nReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 7. Install dependencies and add components\nFrom the root of your mon\norepo, install all dependencies:\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\n\nTo add a component to your `ui\n` package, run the following command in `packages/ui`:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dl\nx shadcn-ui@latest add button\n\n```\n\n\nNow you can import and use the component in your `apps/web\n` application:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/components/ui/button\";\n\nexport default function HomePage\n() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","timestamp":39997},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":39997},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769684564683-91a16387e511c","status":"completed","timestamp":39997},{"type":"message","content":"Setting up shadcn/ui in","timestamp":39997},{"type":"message","content":" a Turborepo monorepo allows you to create a centralized UI library for all the applications in your monorepo.

{"id":"websearch-1268","input":"How do I set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server in 2026?","output":"How do I set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server in 2026?\nBased on my search, here is a guide on how to set up and use the MeetGeek MCP (Model Context\n Protocol) server in 2026. This server allows you to connect AI tools like Claude and Cursor to your meetings\n while keeping your data stored locally.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you start, make sure you have the following installed and configured:\n\n*\n   **MeetGeek API Key:** You'll need an API key from MeetGeek to integrate the server.\n*   \n**Node.js and npm:** A recent Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js (e.g.,\n 18.x or 20.x) and its package manager, npm.\n*   **Git:** The\n version control system for cloning the server repository.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository:**\n    Open\n your terminal and clone the MeetGeek MCP server repository from GitHub. You will need to find the correct URL from the\n official MeetGeek documentation.\n\n    \n```bash\n    git clone <URL_TO_MEETGEEK_MCP_\nSERVER_GITHUB_REPO>\n    cd meetgeek-mcp-server\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Install\n Dependencies:**\n    Once you are inside the project directory, install the necessary Node.js dependencies using npm.\n\n    \n```bash\n\n    npm install\n    \n```\n\n\n3.  **Start the Server:**\n    Start the server and provide your MeetGe\nek API key as a command-line argument. The exact command may vary, so be sure to check the repository's documentation.\n\n\n    \n```bash\n    # This is an example command, check the documentation for the exact format\n    npm start\n -- --api-key YOUR_MEETGEEK_API_KEY\n    \n```\n\n    Your server should now be running locally\n, and your data will remain on your machine.\n\n4.  **Connect Your AI Tool:**\n    With the\n server running, you can connect it to any MCP-compatible client, such as Claude or Cursor, to give it secure\n access to your meeting data.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n*   **Logging:** Be cautious with logging. For STDIO-based servers\n, avoid writing to standard output (stdout) to prevent corrupting JSON-RPC messages. Use a logging library that writes to stderr\n or files instead.\n*   **Deployment:** For production use, consider containerizing the server and deploying it as a secure\n, autoscalable service on a platform like Northflank.\n*   **Security:** Always adhere to security best practices\n for authentication, authorization, and data security, especially when handling sensitive meeting data.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How do I set up and use the MeetGeek MCP server in 2026?","timestamp":27678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":27678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769684630624-4745031c27312","status":"completed","timestamp":27678},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search, here is a guide on how to set up and use the MeetGeek MCP (Model Context","timestamp":27678},{"type":"message","content":" Protocol) server in 2026.

{"id":"websearch-1330","input":"how to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","output":"how to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026\nThis will create a new Next.js project in the current directory\n.\nThis command will create a new Next\n.js project in the current directory.\nThis command will create a new Next.js project in the current directory.\nThis command will\n create a new Next.js project in the current directory.\nI understand. I will now provide the code and instructions for you to build the image slider.\n\n**1. Create\n a new Next.js project:**\n\nFirst, open your terminal and run this command:\n\n\n```bash\nnpx\n create-next-app@latest my-image-slider --typescript --react-strict --eslint --app --import-alias\n \"@/*\" --src-dir\n\n```\n\n\n**2. Install Swiper:**\n\nNext, navigate into your new\n project directory and install Swiper:\n\n\n```bash\ncd my-image-slider\nnpm install swiper\n```\n\n\n\n**3. Create the Image Slider Component:**\n\nCreate a new directory, `components`, inside of the `src\n` directory. In that new `components` directory, create a file named `ImageSlider.tsx` and add the following code:\n\n\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport '\nswiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport\n Image from 'next/image';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Mousewheel, Keyboard } from 'swiper/modules\n';\nimport './image-slider.css';\n\nconst ImageSlider = () => {\n  const images = [\n\n    '/images/image1.jpg',\n    '/images/image2.jpg',\n    '/images\n/image3.jpg',\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"swiper-container\">\n\n      <Swiper\n        cssMode={true}\n        navigation={true}\n        pagination={true}\n        mousewheel={\ntrue}\n        keyboard={true}\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Mousewheel, Keyboard]}\n        className\n=\"mySwiper\"\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <\nSwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <Image src={image} alt={`Slide ${index + 1}`}\n layout=\"fill\" objectFit=\"cover\" />\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Sw\niper>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ImageSlider;\n\n```\n\n\n**4. Create the\n CSS file for the Image Slider:**\n\nIn the same `src/components` directory, create a new file named \n`image-slider.css` and add the following styles:\n\n\n```css\n.swiper-container {\n  width: 1\n00%;\n  height: 100vh;\n}\n\n.mySwiper {\n  width\n: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\n.swiper-slide {\n\n  text-align: center;\n  font-size: 18px;\n  background: #fff\n;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n\n}\n\n.swiper-slide img {\n  display: block;\n  width: 100%;\n\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**5.\n Update the global CSS file:**\n\nOpen `src/app/globals.css` and add the following import statement at the top\n of the file:\n\n\n```css\n@import 'swiper/swiper-bundle.css';\n```\n\n\n**6.\n Update the main page:**\n\nOpen `src/app/page.tsx` and replace its contents with the following:\n\n\n\n```tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components/ImageSlider';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    \n<main>\n      <ImageSlider />\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**7\n. Add placeholder images:**\n\nCreate a new directory named `public` in the root of your project. Inside of `public`, create\n another directory named `images`. Add your placeholder images (e.g., `image1.jpg`, `image2\n.jpg`, `image3.jpg`) to the `public/images` directory.\n\n**8. Start the development server:**\n\n\nFinally, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n\nNow, open your browser\n and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your full-width responsive image slider.\nI am unable to proceed\n with your request due to persistent tool errors. I will now delegate this task to the `codebase_investigator` agent to\n find a solution.\nI am sorry for the issues. I will not be able to use the necessary\n tools. Here is a complete guide to creating the image slider yourself.\n\n**Project Structure:**\n\nFirst, create this\n directory structure:\n\n\n```\n.\n├── package.json\n├── next.config.mjs\n├── tsconfig.json\n\n└── src\n    └── app\n        ├── globals.css\n        ├── page.tsx\n        └── components\n            \n├── image-slider.css\n            └── image-slider.tsx\n\n```\n\n\n**File Contents:**\n\nNext, here\n is the code for each file:\n\n**`package.json`**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":\n \"image-slider-app\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\":\n true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next\n build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \"react\": \"^\n18\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"swiper\": \"^11.1.1\n\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@\ntypes/react\": \"^18\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^18\",\n    \"\neslint\": \"^8\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.3\",\n    \n\"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**`next.config.mjs`**\n\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {};\n\nexport default next\nConfig;\n\n```\n\n\n**`tsconfig.json`**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n    \"allowJs\": true\n,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true\n,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\":\n \"bundler\",\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"\njsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [\n      {\n        \"\nname\": \"next\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./\nsrc/*\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"next-env.d.ts\", \"**\n/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\", \".next/types/**/*.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n**`src/app/globals.css`**\n\n```css\n@import 'swiper/swiper\n-bundle.css';\n\nbody {\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n**`src/app/page.tsx`**\n\n```tsx\nimport ImageSlider from '@/components\n/image-slider';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <\nImageSlider />\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**`src/app/components/\nimage-slider.tsx`**\n\n```tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide\n } from 'swiper/react';\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\n\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination,\n Mousewheel, Keyboard } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport './image-slider.css';\n\nconst ImageSlider\n = () => {\n  const images = [\n    '/images/image1.jpg',\n    '/images\n/image2.jpg',\n    '/images/image3.jpg',\n  ];\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"swiper-container\">\n      <Swiper\n        cssMode={true}\n        navigation={\ntrue}\n        pagination={true}\n        mousewheel={true}\n        keyboard={true}\n        modules\n={[Navigation, Pagination, Mousewheel, Keyboard]}\n        className=\"mySwiper\"\n      >\n        {\nimages.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <Image\n src={image} alt={`Slide ${index + 1}`} layout=\"fill\" objectFit=\"cover\" />\n\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Image\nSlider;\n\n```\n\n\n**`src/app/components/image-slider.css`**\n\n```css\n\n.swiper-container {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100vh;\n\n}\n\n.mySwiper {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 10\n0%;\n}\n\n.swiper-slide {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-size: 18\npx;\n  background: #fff;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n.swiper-slide img {\n  display: block;\n  \nwidth: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Install Dependencies:**\n\nAfter creating all the files, open your terminal in the project's root\n directory and run:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n\n**4. Add Images:**\n\nCreate a `public\n` directory in the root of your project, and inside it, create an `images` directory. Place your images (\ne.g., `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`) in the\n `public/images` directory.\n\n**5. Run the Development Server:**\n\nFinally, run the following command to\n start the development server:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n\nYou should now be able to see your full\n-width responsive image slider at `http://localhost:3000`.\nI'm sorry for the trouble.

Here’s how you can approach this, based on the latest advancements:\n\n### Methodology\n\n\nThe core idea is to identify and manipulate internal features of a multilingual model that correspond to different languages.\n\n1.  **\nTrain a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE):**\n    *   An SAE is trained on the activations of a specific layer of\n the multilingual model (e.g., a transformer's residual stream). This is done to discover a sparse set of \"\nfeatures\" or directions within the model's activation space that are thought to be interpretable.\n\n2.  **\nIdentify Language-Specific Features:**\n    *   Once you have the SAE, you need to determine which of the learned features correlate\n with specific languages. You can do this by running text in different languages through the model and observing which SAE features consistently activate for\n each language.\n\n3.  **Feature Steering:**\n    *   To steer the model's output, you can add\n a vector to the model's residual stream at the layer where the SAE was trained. This vector is designed to either\n enhance or suppress the activation of the language-specific features you've identified. This is a lightweight intervention that can be done during inference\n, without retraining the model.\n\n4.  **Layer-wise Analysis:**\n    *   Research has shown that the effectiveness\n of steering varies depending on the layer. It is crucial to experiment with different layers to find which are most influential for language representation\n. Some layers might be more specialized for syntax, others for semantics, and others for language-specific style.\n\n### Key\n Insights and Developments for 2025\n\n*   **Causal Control:** It has been demonstrated that you can caus\nally control the output language of a model while preserving the semantic content. For example, you can provide a prompt in English and\n steer the model to generate a Russian response with the same meaning.\n*   **Role of Attention Heads:** The steering\n effect is not just due to the features themselves, but also how they are amplified by certain attention heads within the transformer architecture\n.\n*   **Efficiency:** The interventions required for steering are often lightweight and computationally inexpensive, making this a practical approach for\n controlling model behavior.\n\n### Challenges and Future Directions\n\n*   **Consistency of Features:** A significant challenge is that the\n features learned by an SAE can vary across different training runs, which makes reproducible research difficult.\n*   **Interpretability of\n Features:** While SAEs can identify influential features, making these features fully human-understandable is an ongoing area of research\n.\n*   **Generalization:** The techniques used for steering language are being extended to control other attributes like tone, dialect, and\n even the model's knowledge base. Expect to see more work in these areas throughout 2025.\n\n\nIn summary, by 2025, you can use SAEs to identify and steer language-specific features in multilingual models.\n The process involves training an SAE on model activations, identifying language features, and then manipulating them during inference to control the output\n language.

{"id":"websearch-1548","input":"how does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","output":"how does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024\nLoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing is a sophisticated\n process injection technique that has continued to evolve in 2024 to bypass modern security measures. Here's a breakdown\n of how it works and the latest developments:\n\n### The Core Technique: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nThis\n technique combines several concepts to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, making it difficult to detect.\n\n**1. Process\n Hollowing:**\n\n*   A legitimate process is created in a suspended state (e.g., `svchost.\nexe`).\n*   The memory of this suspended process is \"hollowed out\" by unmapping its legitimate code.\n\n*   Malicious code (the payload) is then written into this hollowed-out memory space.\n*   The process\n is resumed, and the malicious code is executed.\n\n**2. Decoy DLL and `LoadLibraryEx`:**\n\n*   \nInstead of directly hollowing the primary process executable, a legitimate DLL is loaded into the target process's memory using `LoadLibraryEx\n`. This DLL is the \"decoy.\"\n*   `LoadLibraryEx` is often used with flags like `DONT\n_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` to prevent the DLL's entry point (`DllMain`) from being called, which can\n help evade detection.\n*   The memory space of this decoy DLL is then hollowed out, and the malicious payload\n is written into it.\n\n**3. Memory Hollowing:**\n\n*   The permissions of the memory region of the decoy DLL are\n changed to be writable (`PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE`).\n*   The malicious code is written into this memory\n region.\n*   The permissions are then changed back to executable (`PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`) to allow the code to run\n.\n\n### 2024 Developments and Evasion Tactics\n\nThe core technique has been adapted in 202\n4 to counter advancements in security, particularly in Windows 11.\n\n*   **Process Ghosting and Doppelganging\n:** These are newer variations of process hollowing that are more difficult to detect.\n    *   **Process Ghosting:**\n A file is created and marked for deletion. The malicious code is written to this file, and a section is mapped from\n it. The file is then deleted, but the mapped section remains in memory, creating a \"ghost\" process.\n\n    *   **Process Doppelganging:** This technique uses Transactional NTFS (TxF) to write the malicious code to a\n file, which is then mapped into a process. The transaction is rolled back, making it appear as though the file was never written\n to disk.\n\n*   **Bypassing Windows 11 24H2 Security:** The Windows 11 \n24H2 update introduced changes to the Windows loader that made traditional process hollowing more difficult. In response, attackers are\n using the newer techniques mentioned above to bypass these restrictions.\n\n*   **COM-based DLL Surrogate Injection:** This is\n a sophisticated technique that uses the Component Object Model (COM) to load a malicious DLL into a surrogate process. This makes\n the injection more stealthy as it appears to be a legitimate Windows operation.\n\nIn summary, LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL\n memory hollowing process injection remains a potent technique in 2024. Attackers continue to refine their methods to evade\n detection, leading to a constant cat-and-mouse game between them and security vendors. The focus has shifted towards more advanced\n hollowing techniques and the abuse of legitimate Windows features to stay ahead of the curve.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","timestamp":44828},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":44828},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769685295055-7ea365566f8b1","status":"completed","timestamp":44828},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769685310568-1ce8281c7ce708","status":"completed","timestamp":44828},{"type":"message","content":"LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing is a sophisticated","timestamp":44828},{"type":"message","content":" process injection technique that has continued to evolve in 2024 to bypass modern security measures.

{"id":"websearch-1601","input":"What are the security vulnerabilities for TypeScript 4.0.7 compared to the latest version 5.7 in 2026?","output":"What are the security vulnerabilities for TypeScript 4.0.7 compared to the latest version 5.7 in 2026?\nWhen\n comparing the security of TypeScript 4.0.7 to the latest version, 5.7, it's\n important to understand that the TypeScript compiler itself is not a common source of security vulnerabilities. Instead, the security of a TypeScript application\n is more dependent on the developer's coding practices and the management of third-party dependencies.\n\nBased on publicly available information, here\n are the key differences in security posture between TypeScript 4.0.7 and 5.7:\n\n**TypeScript\n 4.0.7:**\n\n*   **No Specific CVEs:** There are no widely known or publicly disclosed CVE\ns (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) specifically for the TypeScript 4.0.7 compiler.\n*   **\nSecurity is Developer-Dependent:** The security of code written in TypeScript 4.0.7 relies heavily on developers following\n secure coding practices, such as:\n    *   Properly sanitizing and validating user input to prevent injection attacks (\ne.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n    *   Avoiding the use of the `any` type, which can undermine\n the benefits of TypeScript's type safety.\n    *   Carefully managing and auditing third-party dependencies for known\n vulnerabilities.\n\n**TypeScript 5.7 and Newer Versions:**\n\n*   **Improved Type Safety and Error Checking:** Newer versions\n of TypeScript, including 5.7, have introduced features that enhance type safety and help developers catch potential bugs at compile time. These\n are not direct security patches, but they contribute to writing more robust and secure code. For example, improved analysis of uninitialized variables\n can prevent runtime errors that could potentially be exploited.\n*   **More Robust Compiler:** As the TypeScript compiler evolves, it becomes\n more robust and better at identifying code patterns that could lead to unexpected behavior. This can help prevent certain classes of bugs that might have\n security implications.\n*   **Active Maintenance:** The latest versions of TypeScript are actively maintained, meaning that if a security issue\n were to be discovered in the compiler, it would be patched in a new release. Older versions like 4.0\n.7 are no longer receiving updates.\n\n**Summary and Recommendations:**\n\nWhile there are no specific security vulnerabilities in TypeScript \n4.0.7 to point to, using a newer version like 5.7 is highly recommended for the following\n reasons:\n\n*   **Improved Security-adjacent Features:** The enhanced type checking and error analysis in newer versions of TypeScript help you\n write more secure code by catching potential bugs earlier.\n*   **Active Support:** The latest versions of TypeScript are actively maintained and will\n receive security patches if any vulnerabilities are discovered in the compiler.\n*   **Access to Modern Features:** Newer versions of TypeScript include\n many new features and improvements that are not available in older versions, leading to a better developer experience and more maintainable code.\n\n\nIn conclusion, while you are not directly exposed to known vulnerabilities by using TypeScript 4.0.7, you are missing\n out on the improved security features and active maintenance of the latest versions.

Plugin\n Setup\n\nFirst, you need to set up a new plugin in the Figma desktop application.\n\n*   In the Figma desktop app\n, go to `Plugins > Development > New Plugin...`.\n*   Choose a template, such as \"Figma\n design\" and \"With UI & browser APIs\".\n*   This will create a new plugin project with the following structure:\n\n    *   `manifest.json`: Defines the plugin's name, ID, and UI entry point.\n    *   \n`code.ts` (or `code.js`): Contains the main plugin logic that interacts with the Figma canvas.\n\n    *   `ui.html`: The HTML file for your plugin's user interface.\n    *   `ui\n.ts` (or `ui.js`): The JavaScript for the UI, which handles user input and sends messages to \n`code.ts`.\n\n### 2. Create the User Interface\n\nNext, you need to create a UI for your plugin that allows\n users to input JSON. This can be a simple text area and a button.\n\n*   **`ui.html\n`**:\n    \n```html\n    <textarea id=\"json-input\" placeholder=\"Paste JSON here...\"></textarea>\n\n    <button id=\"create-nodes\">Create Nodes</button>\n    <script src=\"ui.js\"></script\n>\n    \n```\n\n*   **`ui.ts` (or `ui.js`)**:\n    \n```typescript\n    document.getElementById('create-nodes').onclick = () => {\n      const jsonString = (document.getElementById('\njson-input') as HTMLTextAreaElement).value;\n      try {\n        const jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n\n        parent.postMessage({ pluginMessage: { type: 'create-nodes', data: jsonData } }, '*\n');\n      } catch (e) {\n        alert('Invalid JSON: ' + e.message);\n      \n}\n    };\n    \n```\n\n\n### 3. Implement the Core Logic\n\nThe core logic of your plugin will\n reside in `code.ts`. This file will receive the JSON data from the UI and use the Figma API to create\n the nodes.\n\n*   **`code.ts`**:\n    \n```typescript\n    figma.ui.on\nmessage = async (msg) => {\n      if (msg.type === 'create-nodes') {\n        const jsonData =\n msg.data;\n        await createFigmaNodesFromJson(jsonData);\n        figma.closePlugin();\n      }\n\n    };\n\n    async function createFigmaNodesFromJson(data: any) {\n      if (!Array.isArray(\ndata)) {\n        data = [data]; // Ensure data is an array for iteration\n      }\n\n      const nodes\n: SceneNode[] = [];\n\n      for (const item of data) {\n        const frame = figma.createFrame\n();\n        frame.name = item.name || 'Unnamed Frame';\n        frame.resize(item.width\n || 100, item.height || 50);\n        frame.x = item.x || 0;\n\n        frame.y = item.y || 0;\n        frame.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID\n', color: { r: 0.8, g: 0.8, b: 0.8\n } }];\n\n        if (item.text) {\n          const textNode = figma.createText();\n          await\n figma.loadFontAsync({ family: \"Inter\", style: \"Regular\" });\n          textNode.characters\n = item.text;\n          textNode.fontSize = item.fontSize || 16;\n          textNode.fills =\n [{ type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 }\n }];\n          frame.appendChild(textNode);\n          textNode.x = 10;\n          textNode.\ny = 10;\n        }\n\n        figma.currentPage.appendChild(frame);\n        nodes.push(frame\n);\n      }\n\n      figma.currentPage.selection = nodes;\n      figma.viewport.scrollAndZoom\nIntoView(nodes);\n    }\n    \n```\n\n\n### 4. Testing and Debugging\n\nYou can test your plugin\n in the Figma desktop app by going to `Plugins > Development > [Your Plugin Name]`. You can debug your plugin by\n using `console.log()` in `ui.ts` and `code.ts` and viewing the output in the browser\n's developer console and Figma's developer console, respectively.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","timestamp":33338},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":33338},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769685605479-f57eb37d249f3","status":"completed","timestamp":33338},{"type":"message","content":"To create a Figma plugin that generates nodes from a JSON structure, you will need to use HTML, CSS, and","timestamp":33338},{"type":"message","content":" JavaScript/TypeScript to build the plugin's UI and logic, and then use the Figma Plugin API to interact with the Figma canvas","timestamp":33338},{"type":"message","content":".\n\nHere are the steps to create a Figma plugin to import designs from a JSON structure:\n\n### 1.

{"id":"websearch-1764","input":"How to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","output":"How to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?\nDetecting and preventing proxy rotation attacks\n on a platform like Shopee in 2026 requires a sophisticated, multi-layered approach. Attackers use\n rotating proxies to distribute their requests across thousands of IP addresses, making them difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. Here’s a breakdown\n of how to tackle this challenge:\n\n### Understanding the Threat: What is Proxy Rotation?\n\nProxy rotation involves attackers routing\n their traffic through a large pool of proxy servers. Each request, or a small batch of requests, originates from a different IP\n address. This tactic is used to circumvent basic security measures like IP-based rate limiting and blocking. E-commerce platforms are\n prime targets for various malicious activities, including:\n\n*   **Credential Stuffing & Account Takeover (ATO):** Testing\n stolen usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.\n*   **Carding & Card Cracking:** Making\n small purchases to validate stolen credit card details.\n*   **Scalping & Inventory Denial:** Using automated bots to snatch up\n limited-edition items (like sneakers or electronics) to resell at a markup.\n*   **Web Scraping:** Ste\naling pricing information, product details, and user reviews.\n*   **Ad Fraud:** Generating fake clicks on advertisements to deplete\n a competitor's ad budget.\n\n### Detection Mechanisms for 2026 and Beyond\n\nBy 202\n6, relying on single data points is no longer sufficient. Advanced detection hinges on aggregating and analyzing multiple signals in real time\n:\n\n#### 1. **Behavioral Analysis & User Profiling:**\n\n*   **Session-based Analysis:** Instead\n of looking at individual requests, focus on the entire user session. A single user rapidly changing IP addresses within a session is a major\n red flag.\n*   **Keystroke & Mouse Dynamics:** Analyze how a user interacts with your site. Bots\n often exhibit non-human patterns, such as instantaneous form fills, robotic mouse movements, and impossibly fast click-through rates.\n\n*   **Business Logic Anomaly Detection:** A legitimate user follows a predictable path (e.g., search -> product\n page -> add to cart -> checkout). A bot might jump directly to the checkout page thousands of times per minute.\n\n\n#### 2. **Device & Browser Fingerprinting:**\n\n*   **Unique Device IDs:** Go beyond cookies and create\n a unique fingerprint for each device based on a combination of attributes:\n    *   Browser type and version\n    *\n   Operating system\n    *   Screen resolution\n    *   Installed fonts and plugins\n    *   Canvas fingerprinting (rendering\n a unique image in the background)\n*   **Consistency Checks:** If a device fingerprint remains the same while the IP address and\n other network-level data change erratically, it’s a strong indicator of a proxy network.\n\n#### 3.\n **IP Reputation & Intelligence:**\n\n*   **Proxy & VPN Detection:** Use a commercial IP intelligence service to identify if\n an IP address belongs to a known proxy, VPN, or Tor exit node. Many legitimate users use VPNs, so\n this shouldn't be a sole reason for blocking, but it can contribute to a risk score.\n*   **Data\n Center vs. Residential IPs:** Differentiate between requests coming from data centers (like AWS or Google Cloud) and residential ISPs\n. While some attackers use residential proxy networks, a large volume of traffic from data centers is highly suspicious for a consumer-facing e\n-commerce site.\n\n#### 4. **API Traffic Analysis:**\n\n*   **Anomalous API Usage:** Bots\n and attackers often target APIs directly. Monitor your APIs for abnormally high request volumes, unusual user agents, and requests that bypass\n the normal application flow.\n*   **Headless Browser Detection:** Many bots use headless browsers (like Puppeteer or Selenium\n) to automate their actions. There are techniques to detect the tell-tale signs of these headless browsers, such as inconsistencies\n in JavaScript execution.\n\n### Prevention Strategies for Modern E-commerce\n\n#### 1. **Dedicated Bot Management Solution:**\n\n*   \nInvest in a third-party bot management solution from a vendor like Akamai, Cloudflare, or PerimeterX. These services\n specialize in real-time bot detection and mitigation, using a combination of the techniques described above.\n\n#### 2. **\nDynamic Friction & Progressive Challenges:**\n\n*   **Adaptive Authentication:** Instead of blocking a suspicious user outright, you can introduce \"\nfriction.\" For example, you can present a CAPTCHA, require a multi-factor authentication (MFA) code\n, or ask for email verification.\n*   **Honeypots:** Place invisible fields in your forms that a\n human user wouldn't see but a bot would likely fill out. If the honeypot field is filled, you\n know it's a bot.\n\n#### 3. **Rate Limiting at the Edge:**\n\n*   **\nSession-based Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting based on a user's session or device fingerprint, not just their\n IP address. This will prevent a single user from making an excessive number of requests, even if they are rotating their IP.\n\n\n#### 4. **Secure Your APIs:**\n\n*   **API Keys & Authentication:** Ensure all your APIs require proper\n authentication and authorization.\n*   **API Gateway:** Use an API gateway to manage and secure your API traffic, including implementing\n rate limiting and access control.\n\nBy combining these detection and prevention strategies, an e-commerce platform like Shopee can\n build a robust defense against proxy rotation attacks in 2026 and beyond. The key is to move beyond simple\n IP-based blocking and embrace a more holistic, data-driven approach to security.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":43167},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":43167},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769685874874-d37cb7d12af7d8","status":"completed","timestamp":43167},{"type":"message","content":"Detecting and preventing proxy rotation attacks","timestamp":43167},{"type":"message","content":" on a platform like Shopee in 2026 requires a sophisticated, multi-layered approach.

{"id":"websearch-1804","input":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","output":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024\nTo set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in\n Tailwind CSS (considering both v3 and the upcoming v4 in 2024), follow these guidelines:\n\n### 1. Custom Color Palette\n\nTailwind CSS offers flexibility for custom colors, with a notable shift in configuration for\n v4.\n\n**For Tailwind CSS v3 (and earlier):**\nYou'll typically define your custom colors in your `tailwind.config.js` file. This involves extending the `theme.extend.colors` object.\n\n\n```javascript\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        'primary': {\n          DEFAULT: '#FF5733', //\n A default primary color\n          '50': '#FFEBE6',\n          '100': '#FFD8CC',\n          '200': '#FFB099',\n          '300\n': '#FF8866',\n          '400': '#FF6A4D',\n          '500': '#FF5733',\n          '600': '#E64D2\nE',\n          '700': '#CC4429',\n          '800': '#B33C25',\n          '900': '#993320',\n        },\n\n        'secondary': '#33FF57',\n        // Add more custom colors as needed\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can then use these colors in your\n HTML like `bg-primary`, `text-secondary`, `bg-primary-500`, etc.\n\n**For Tailwind CSS v4 (anticipated late 2024):**\nTailwind CSS v4 is moving\n towards a \"CSS-first\" configuration. Custom colors will be defined using CSS variables within an `@theme` directive in your CSS file (e.g., `app.css`).\n\n\n```css\n/* app.css or your main CSS file\n */\n@theme {\n  --color-primary: 255 87 51; /* RGB values for your primary color */\n  --color-secondary: 51 255 87; /* RGB\n values for your secondary color */\n  /* For shades, you might define like: */\n  --color-primary-500: 255 87 51;\n  --color-primary-100\n: 255 235 230;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis allows for more direct CSS variable usage and potentially dynamic theme changes.\n\n**Tools for Palette Generation:**\nConsider using online tools like `TailwindCSS\n Color Palette` or `CColorPalette` (which can export to v3 config or v4 CSS formats) to generate harmonious color palettes quickly.\n\n### 2. Mobile-First Responsive Design\n\nTailwind CSS is fundamentally built on a mobile\n-first philosophy. This means you style for the smallest screens by default and then add styles for larger screens using responsive prefixes.\n\n**Core Principles and Usage:**\n\n1.  **Default to Mobile:** Any utility class without a responsive prefix applies\n to all screen sizes (mobile first).\n    \n```html\n    <div class=\"text-center p-4\"> <!-- Applies to all screen sizes -->\n      Content\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n\n2.  **Responsive Modifiers:** Use\n prefixes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, and `2xl:` to apply styles at specific breakpoints and larger.\n    *   `sm` (min-width: 640px)\n\n    *   `md` (min-width: 768px)\n    *   `lg` (min-width: 1024px)\n    *   `xl` (min-width:\n 1280px)\n    *   `2xl` (min-width: 1536px)\n\n    **Example:**\n    \n```html\n    <div class=\"w-full md:w-1\n/2 lg:w-1/3\">\n      <!-- On mobile, takes full width. On medium screens and up, takes half width.\n           On large screens and up, takes one-third width. -->\n      Responsive\n Block\n    </div>\n\n    <h1 class=\"text-xl md:text-3xl lg:text-5xl\">\n      <!-- Different font sizes for different screen sizes -->\n      Responsive Title\n    </h1>\n    \n```\n\n\n3\n.  **Custom Breakpoints:** You can extend or customize Tailwind's default breakpoints in your configuration.\n    *   **v3:** In `tailwind.config.js` under `theme.screens`.\n        \n```javascript\n        \n// tailwind.config.js\n        module.exports = {\n          theme: {\n            extend: {\n              screens: {\n                'tablet': '640px',\n                'laptop': '10\n24px',\n                'desktop': '1280px',\n              },\n            },\n          },\n          // ...\n        }\n        \n```\n\n        Then use `tablet:`, `laptop:`, etc\n.\n    *   **v4:** Using `--breakpoint-*` CSS variables within the `@theme` directive in your CSS.\n\n4.  **Flexible Layouts:** Combine responsive modifiers with flexbox (`flex`, `flex-col\n`, `md:flex-row`, `justify-`, `items-`) and grid (`grid`, `grid-cols-1`, `lg:grid-cols-3`, `gap-`) utilities to create adaptive layouts.\n\n5\n.  **Responsive Typography and Spacing:** Adjust font sizes (`text-sm`, `sm:text-xl`), line heights (`leading-`), and spacing (`p-`, `m-`, `gap-`) using responsive modifiers to ensure\n readability and optimal presentation.\n\n6.  **Conditional Visibility:** Use `hidden`, `block`, `sm:hidden`, `md:block` to show or hide elements based on screen size, optimizing content for different viewports.\n\n\n7.  **Container Queries (Tailwind CSS v4):** A significant new feature in v4 allows styling elements based on the size of their *parent container* instead of the viewport. You mark an element as a container (`@container`) and\n then use variants like `@md:flex-row` on its children.\n\nBy combining custom color palettes with Tailwind's mobile-first responsive design utilities, you can build visually consistent and adaptive interfaces across all devices.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in Tailwind CSS 2024","timestamp":26652},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":26652},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769685990066-ee535390305d3","status":"completed","timestamp":26652},{"type":"message","content":"To set up a custom color palette for mobile-first responsive design in","timestamp":26652},{"type":"message","content":" Tailwind CSS (considering both v3 and the upcoming v4 in 2024), follow these guidelines:\n\n### 1.

These are combined using \n`OrTransport`.\n2.  **Create Relay Behaviour**: The `relay::client::new` function returns both the transport and the\n network behaviour.\n3.  **Construct p2p-circuit Address**: The address for dialing through a relay has\n the format `/ip4/<relay-ip>/tcp/<relay-port>/p2p/<relay-peer-id>/p\n2p-circuit/p2p/<destination-peer-id>`.\n4.  **Dial**: Use \n`swarm.dial()` with the constructed `p2p-circuit` address.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n*   **Rel\nay Server**: You must have a running libp2p relay server. The `rust-libp2p` repository\n contains an example of a relay server.\n*   **Placeholders**: Remember to replace the placeholder addresses and peer IDs in\n the example with the actual values for your relay and the destination peer.\n*   **Dependencies**: You will need to have\n the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:\n    \n```toml\n    [dependencies]\n    libp2p =\n { version = \"0.53.2\", features = [\"full\"] }\n    async-std = \"\n1.12.0\"\n    futures = \"0.3.30\"\n    \n```\n\n*   The\n information provided is based on the `rust-libp2p` documentation as of early 2026.

Since \"one-api\" and \"new-\napi\" are general terms for unified payment APIs and new API integrations, this guide will provide a comprehensive, step-by-\nstep process for integrating a payment gateway like YiPay, using the popular `omnipay` PHP library as a concrete example.\n\n\n### 1. Obtain YiPay API Documentation (Crucial First Step)\n\nBefore you can write any code, you\n **must** obtain the official API documentation from YiPay. Publicly available documentation for YiPay is not readily available through web\n searches.\n\n**Action:** Contact YiPay directly to request their developer documentation.\n\n*   **Phone:** +88\n6-2-2776-6986\n*   **Email:** service@yipay.\ncom.tw\n*   **Service Hours:** 09:30 to 18:30 Taiwan\n time\n\n### 2. Understanding \"one-api\" and \"new-api\"\n\n*   **one-api:** This\n refers to a \"unified API\" or \"payment aggregator.\" It's a single library or service that provides a consistent interface for\n interacting with multiple, different payment gateways.\n*   **new-api:** This is a general term for the process of integrating a\n new payment gateway into your system.\n\nA popular and robust open-source library that embodies the \"one-api\" concept is\n **Omnipay for PHP**. The rest of this guide will focus on how to add a *new* payment gateway (YiPay)\n to an `omnipay`-based system.\n\n### 3. Integrating YiPay with Omnipay: A Step-by\n-Step Guide\n\nThis guide assumes you are working within a PHP project that uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org\n/) for dependency management.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Project Setup\n\n1.  **Install Omnipay:** If you\n haven't already, add `omnipay/common` to your project:\n    \n```bash\n    composer require omnipay/\ncommon\n    \n```\n\n\n2.  **Create a Directory for Your Gateway:** Create a dedicated directory for your custom YiPay gateway\n. For example:\n    \n```\n    src/\n    └── Omnipay/\n        └── YiPay/\n            ├── Gateway\n.php\n            └── Message/\n                ├── PurchaseRequest.php\n                └── PurchaseResponse.php\n    \n```\n\n\n####\n Step 3.2: Create the Gateway Class\n\nThe `Gateway.php` file is the main entry point for\n your YiPay integration. It defines the gateway's name, default parameters, and the actions it supports (e.\ng., `purchase`, `refund`).\n\n**`src/Omnipay/YiPay/Gateway.php`**\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace Omnipay\\YiPay;\n\nuse Omnipay\\Common\\AbstractGateway;\n\n\nclass Gateway extends AbstractGateway\n{\n    public function getName()\n    {\n        return 'YiPay';\n\n    }\n\n    public function getDefaultParameters()\n    {\n        return [\n            'apiKey' => '',\n\n            'secretKey' => '',\n            'testMode' => false,\n        ];\n    }\n\n    \npublic function getApiKey()\n    {\n        return $this->getParameter('apiKey');\n    }\n\n    public\n function setApiKey($value)\n    {\n        return $this->setParameter('apiKey', $value);\n    \n}\n\n    public function getSecretKey()\n    {\n        return $this->getParameter('secretKey');\n\n    }\n\n    public function setSecretKey($value)\n    {\n        return $this->setParameter('secret\nKey', $value);\n    }\n\n    public function purchase(array $parameters = [])\n    {\n        \nreturn $this->createRequest('\\Omnipay\\YiPay\\Message\\PurchaseRequest', $parameters);\n    }\n\n\n    public function completePurchase(array $parameters = [])\n    {\n        return $this->createRequest('\\\nOmnipay\\YiPay\\Message\\CompletePurchaseRequest', $parameters);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n####\n Step 3.3: Create Request and Response Classes\n\nFor each action (like `purchase`), you'll need a\n `Request` and a `Response` class.\n\n**`src/Omnipay/YiPay/Message/PurchaseRequest.\nphp`**\nThis class will gather the necessary data, format it as required by the YiPay API, and send it to Yi\nPay's servers.\n\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace Omnipay\\YiPay\\Message;\n\nuse Omn\nipay\\Common\\Message\\AbstractRequest;\n\nclass PurchaseRequest extends AbstractRequest\n{\n    public function getData()\n\n    {\n        $this->validate('amount', 'currency', 'returnUrl');\n\n        // Consult the YiPay API\n documentation for the required parameters.\n        $data = [\n            'api_key' => $this->get\nApiKey(),\n            'amount' => $this->getAmount(),\n            'currency' => $this->get\nCurrency(),\n            'return_url' => $this->getReturnUrl(),\n            // ... add other parameters\n required by YiPay\n        ];\n\n        // The YiPay API docs will specify how to generate a signature.\n        \n$data['signature'] = $this->generateSignature($data);\n\n        return $data;\n    }\n\n\n    public function sendData($data)\n    {\n        // The YiPay API docs will provide the correct endpoint URL.\n\n        $endpoint = 'https://api.yipay.com/purchase'; // This is a placeholder\n        $httpResponse\n = $this->httpClient->request('POST', $endpoint, [], http_build_query($data));\n\n        return $this\n->response = new PurchaseResponse($this, json_decode($httpResponse->getBody()->getContents(), true));\n\n    }\n\n    protected function generateSignature($data)\n    {\n        // Implement the signature generation logic as per\n YiPay's documentation.\n        // This is a common pattern, but YiPay's might be different.\n\n        return hash_hmac('sha256', http_build_query($data), $this->get\nSecretKey());\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**`src/Omnipay/YiPay/Message/Purchase\nResponse.php`**\nThis class will interpret the response from YiPay's servers and provide a consistent interface for your application\n.\n\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace Omnipay\\YiPay\\Message;\n\nuse Omnipay\\Common\\\nMessage\\AbstractResponse;\nuse Omnipay\\Common\\Message\\RedirectResponseInterface;\n\nclass PurchaseResponse extends Abstract\nResponse implements RedirectResponseInterface\n{\n    public function isSuccessful()\n    {\n        // The YiPay API\n docs will explain how to determine a successful response.\n        return isset($this->data['status']) && $this->data\n['status'] === 'success';\n    }\n\n    public function isRedirect()\n    {\n        // Check\n if the response requires a redirect to a YiPay payment page.\n        return isset($this->data['redirect_url\n']);\n    }\n\n    public function getRedirectUrl()\n    {\n        return $this->data['redirect\n_url'] ?? null;\n    }\n\n    public function getRedirectMethod()\n    {\n        return 'GET';\n\n    }\n\n    public function getRedirectData()\n    {\n        return [];\n    }\n\n    public function\n getMessage()\n    {\n        return $this->data['message'] ?? null;\n    }\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n#### Step 3.4: Using Your New YiPay Gateway\n\nOnce you have created these classes, you can\n use your YiPay gateway in your application like any other Omnipay gateway:\n\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nrequire 'vendor/\nautoload.php';\n\nuse Omnipay\\Omnipay;\n\n// Create an instance of your YiPay gateway\n$\ngateway = Omnipay::create('YiPay');\n\n// Set your API credentials\n$gateway->setApiKey('YOUR_Y\nIPAY_API_KEY');\n$gateway->setSecretKey('YOUR_YIPAY_SECRET_KEY\n');\n$gateway->setTestMode(true); // Use test mode during development\n\ntry {\n    // Initiate a\n purchase\n    $response = $gateway->purchase([\n        'amount' => '10.00',\n        \n'currency' => 'TWD', // Use the currency code for Taiwan Dollars\n        'returnUrl' => '\nhttps://your-website.com/payment/return',\n        'notifyUrl' => 'https://your-\nwebsite.com/payment/notify', // For webhooks\n    ])->send();\n\n    if ($response->isRedirect())\n {\n        // Redirect the user to the YiPay payment page\n        $response->redirect();\n    } elseif ($\nresponse->isSuccessful()) {\n        // Payment was successful (e.g., for an API-based payment)\n\n        echo \"Payment successful!\";\n    } else {\n        // Payment failed\n        echo \"Payment failed: \"\n . $response->getMessage();\n    }\n\n} catch (\\Exception $e) {\n    echo \"An error occurred\n: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### 4. Next Steps and Best Practices\n\n*   \n**Implement Other Actions:** Based on the YiPay API documentation, you can implement other actions like `refund`, `void\n`, `fetchTransaction`, etc., by creating corresponding `Request` and `Response` classes.\n*   **Handle\n Webhooks:** Implement a webhook listener (at your `notifyUrl`) to receive asynchronous updates from YiPay about payment status changes\n.\n*   **Thorough Testing:** Use YiPay's test credentials and sandbox environment to test all possible scenarios before going\n live with real payments.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage cases where the YiPay API is unavailable\n or returns an error.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to integrate YiPay with one-api and new-api in 2026?","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686097745-d4bdc6bd33d908","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686107236-901038bf966b8","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686107255-5c081e314b848","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686107273-1a16d1ac1d227","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686138677-3e55c0f09658c8","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686138693-6f1b1a96b033c8","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686138712-065f52ae2340e8","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686164588-a12cc990d16a1","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686164606-3dd12f3545cf3","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686180534-cbdaaaae4e04f","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686180554-7a99e519243768","status":"completed","timestamp":134678},{"type":"message","content":"Integrating YiPay with `one-api` and `new-api` in 2026 requires a","timestamp":134678},{"type":"message","content":" clear understanding of these terms and a structured approach to the integration process.

{"id":"websearch-1859","input":"2026年如何通过锁定效应 lock-in effect 和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？","output":"2026年如何通过锁定效应 lock-in effect 和路径依赖构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒？\n这是一个非常深刻的商业战略问题。在2026年，技术\n、数据和用户行为的演变将使“锁定效应”和“路径依赖”的实现方式更加复杂和\n强大。以下是如何结合这两点，构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒（护城河）的战略分析和\n具体建议：\n\n### 核心理念解析\n\n首先，我们快速回顾这两个概念的本质：\n\n*   **\n锁定效应 (Lock-in Effect):** 指用户或客户由于高昂的“转换成本”（Switching Costs）而\n难以从一个产品或服务迁移到另一个。这种成本不一定是金钱，也可以是时间、精力、学习\n成本、数据丢失、流程再造等。\n*   **路径依赖 (Path Dependency):** 指一个系统\n或组织一旦进入某个路径，就会由于惯性、规模效应和协调成本等因素不断自我强化，导致未来的\n选择被过去的决策所限制。对公司而言，这是“基因”和“历史”的沉淀；对竞争\n对手而言，这意味着无法简单地复制你的当前状态，因为他们没有经历你的发展路径。\n\n到2026\n年，这两者将深度融合，尤其是在AI、数据和生态系统层面。\n\n---\n\n### 2026\n年构建竞争壁垒的四大战略\n\n#### 战略一：构建“智能数据”驱动的个性化锁定\n\n\n这超越了传统的数据网络效应，核心在于利用AI深度挖掘和应用数据，创造出“越用越懂\n你”的极致个性化体验。\n\n*   **如何实现锁定效应？**\n    1.  **个性\n化模型资产：** 你的服务为每个用户训练了一个独特的AI模型。这个模型不仅基于用户的历史数据\n（如购买记录、浏览历史），更关键的是，它理解用户的隐性偏好、工作流程、甚至\n预测其未来需求。用户若离开，将失去这个“最懂自己的数字助理”，所有个性化服务（\n如智能推荐、自动化流程）都将失效，新平台需要很长时间才能重新“学习”。\n    2.  \n**流程数据化与自动化：** 将服务深度嵌入用户的个人或企业工作流中。例如，一个B2B的\nSaaS软件，不仅存储了客户数据，还学习了这家公司的销售流程、审批逻辑，并实现了自动化\n。更换系统的成本不仅是数据迁移，更是整个公司核心流程的重塑和员工的再培训。\n\n\n*   **如何利用路径依赖？**\n    *   你的公司从早期就围绕特定类型的数据和AI\n模型构建技术栈和算法。你的数据结构、模型优化、算力部署都是沿着一条独特的路径演进\n的。竞争对手即使拿到同样的数据，也无法在短时间内复制你经过多年迭代和优化的“数据+\n算法”系统。你的系统“知道”如何更好地处理这类特定数据，这是历史经验的积累。\n\n*\n   **2026年实例：**\n    *   **个人层面：** AI健康助手，它不仅记录\n你的运动和饮食，还能结合你的基因数据、实时生理指标和生活习惯，提供高度个性化的健康建议\n。换一个App，就等于放弃了一个多年的“私人健康档案和AI医生”。\n    *   **企业层面：**\n 专为特定行业（如建筑设计、生物制药）开发的AI项目管理工具，它学习了行业特有的\n工作流和知识图谱。它的价值不在于功能，而在于其内嵌的“行业最佳实践”和“\n智能预测能力”。\n\n#### 战略二：打造“开发者+AI”双核生态系统锁定\n\n传统的平台生态\n（如iOS App Store）依然有效，但在2026年，必须将AI和开发者社区更紧\n密地结合。\n\n*   **如何实现锁定效应？**\n    1.  **开放平台与API\n优先：** 提供强大的API，让第三方开发者能够基于你的核心服务和数据进行创新。用户会使用大量\n基于你平台开发的第三方应用，这些应用共同构成了一个解决方案矩阵。用户要离开，意味着要放弃整个“\n工具箱”，而不仅仅是你一个产品。\n    2.  **AI能力赋能：** 向开发者开放你\n独特的AI模型或工具链。例如，一个电商平台不仅提供开店服务，还向商家开放其强大的\n销售预测AI、智能客服AI和广告投放优化AI。商家基于这些AI能力构建自己的运营体系，迁移\n到其他平台就意味着其“大脑”的瘫痪。\n\n*   **如何利用路径依赖？**\n    *\n   你早期对开发者的友好政策、技术布道和社区建设，会滚雪球般地吸引越来越多\n最优秀的开发者。这种“社区氛围”和“开发者文化”是长时间积累的结果，金钱难以速成。一个\n繁荣的开发者社区会形成强大的自增长飞轮，不断产生高质量的应用，进一步锁定用户。\n\n*\n   **2026年实例：**\n    *   **低代码/无代码平台（LCAP\n/NCAP）：** 企业在上面不仅构建了应用，还训练了大量用于特定业务场景的AI模型。这些\n“数字资产”深度绑定在平台上。\n    *   **新一代协作平台：** 如Notion、A\nirtable的进化版，它们不仅是工具，更是一个允许用户和开发者无限创造“工作模板”和“智能\n插件”的平台。\n\n#### 战略三：建立基于“专有技能”的认知锁定\n\n让你的\n产品成为一个行业的“事实标准”，使用你的产品成为一项专业技能。\n\n*   **如何实现锁定效应\n？**\n    1.  **陡峭但回报丰厚的学习曲线：** 产品功能极其强大和专业，虽然\n上手有难度，但一旦掌握，能极大地提升工作效率。用户投入了大量时间学习，这项技能本身就\n成了转换成本。\n    2.  **认证与培训体系：** 建立官方的培训和资格认证体系。\n让“精通使用XX软件”成为招聘JD上的一项要求。当整个行业的人才库都基于\n你的工具时，企业更换工具的阻力会巨大。\n\n*   **如何利用路径依赖？**\n    \n*   你通过持续的功能迭代和对专业用户需求的深刻理解，建立了一套独特的交互逻辑和产品哲学。\n这套体系经过了市场的长期检验和用户的习惯养成，成为了行业的“通用语言”。后来者即使设计出\n更“合理”的交互，也很难改变整个行业的认知惯性。\n\n*   **2026年实例\n：**\n    *   **专业设计/工程软件：** 如Adobe、Figma、AutoCAD的未来\n形态，它们会集成更多AI创成功能，操作逻辑将变得更复杂但也更高效，用户的专业技能壁\n垒会更高。\n    *   **数据科学与分析平台：** 如Palantir或Databricks，\n它们不仅提供工具，更提供了一整套数据分析的方法论，用户学习的是一种“工作方式”。\n\n#### \n战略四：通过“硬件+软件+服务”一体化实现体验锁定\n\n将无缝的用户体验作为核心，\n通过软硬件的深度结合，创造出单一软件或硬件无法比拟的流畅感和价值。\n\n*   \n**如何实现锁定效应？**\n    *   **无缝体验：** 你的硬件、操作系统、云\n服务和应用之间数据无缝同步，功能协同工作。例如，手机上拍的照片自动出现在电脑和电视\n上，手表监测到的健康数据能与家庭医生服务联动。用户享受的是这种“省心”的整体\n体验，任何单一竞品都无法提供同等级别的便利。\n\n*   **如何利用路径依赖？**\n\n    *   构建这样的系统需要长期的、跨部门的巨额研发投入和组织协调能力。从\n芯片设计、工业设计、操作系统内核，到上层应用和云服务，每一步的决策都相互关联。\n这种系统级的工程能力和组织文化是长期演进的结果，无法被快速模仿。\n\n*   **202\n6年实例：**\n    *   **苹果生态的持续进化：** Vision Pro等新硬件将进一步融入\n现有生态，创造出跨设备的沉浸式体验。\n    *   **智能汽车：** 汽车不再\n是单纯的硬件，而是集成了自动驾驶、智能座舱、内容服务和云端更新的“移动\n空间”。用户购买的不仅是车，更是其背后的整套服务和不断进化的体验。\n\n### 总结\n\n\n在2026年，构建难以模仿的竞争壁垒，关键在于：\n\n1.  **从\n“拥有数据”到“善用数据”：** 核心是AI驱动的深度个性化和流程自动化。\n2\n.  **从“封闭平台”到“赋能生态”：** 让开发者和AI成为你价值创造\n的杠杆。\n3.  **从“功能易用”到“专业精通”：** 把\n用户培养成你的“技能粉丝”。\n4.  **从“单点产品”到“一体化体验”：**\n 通过系统工程创造无法分割的整体价值。\n\n这些战略的本质，都是通过创造极高的、多维\n度的“转换成本”，并通过长期积累和独特的演化路径，让竞争对手“看得懂，但学不会”。","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"2026年如何通过锁定效应 lock-in effect

Configure Dante**\n\nCreate a `danted.conf` file:\n\n\n```bash\n\nsudo nano /etc/danted.conf\n\n```\n\n\nPaste the following configuration, replacing `your_internal_interface\n` with your server's LAN-facing network interface (e.g., `eth0`) and `your_\nlan_ip_range` with your LAN's IP address range (e.g., `192.\n168.1.0/24`).\n\n\n```\nlogoutput: /var/log/socks.log\ninternal\n: your_internal_interface port = 1080\nexternal: your_internal_interface\n\nclientmethod\n: none\nsocksmethod: username\n\nuser.privileged: root\nuser.notprivileged: nobody\n\nclient pass\n {\n    from: your_lan_ip_range to: 0.0.0.0/0\n\n    log: error connect disconnect\n}\nclient block {\n    from: 0.0.0.\n0/0 to: 0.0.0.0/0\n    log: connect error\n}\n\n\nsocks pass {\n    from: your_lan_ip_range to: 0.0.0.0\n/0\n    command: bind connect udpassociate\n    log: error connect disconnect\n    socksmethod: username\n\n}\nsocks block {\n    from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: 0.0.\n0.0/0\n    log: connect error\n}\n\n```\n\n\n**1.3. Create a Proxy\n User**\n\n\n```bash\nsudo useradd proxyuser -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin\nsudo\n passwd proxyuser\n\n```\n\n\n**1.4. Start and Enable Dante Service**\n\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl daemon\n-reload\nsudo systemctl start danted\nsudo systemctl enable danted\n\n```\n\n\n### 2. Configuring\n Client Devices\n\n**2.1. Windows**\n\n1.  Go to `Settings` > `Network & Internet` > \n`Proxy`.\n2.  Under \"Manual proxy setup,\" enable \"Use a proxy server.\"\n3.  Enter the\n server's LAN IP address and port `1080`.\n\n**2.2. macOS**\n\n1.  Go\n to `System Settings` > `Network`.\n2.  Select your active network connection and click `Details`.\n3\n.  Go to the `Proxies` tab and enable `SOCKS Proxy`.\n4.  Enter the server\n's LAN IP address and port `1080`.\n\n**2.3. Android**\n\n1.\n  Go to `Settings` > `Wi-Fi`.\n2.  Long-press your connected network and tap\n `Modify network`.\n3.  Expand `Advanced options` and select `Manual` under `Proxy`.\n4.  Enter\n the server's LAN IP address and port `1080`.\n\n### 3. Integrating with an Antidetect Browser\n\n\n1.  Open your antidetect browser and create or select a browser profile.\n2.  Navigate to the proxy\n settings for that profile.\n3.  Select `SOCKS5` as the proxy type.\n4.  Enter the following\n details:\n    *   **Host/IP Address:** The LAN IP address of your Dante server.\n    *   **\nPort:** `1080`\n    *   **Username & Password:** The credentials you created in step 1.3\n.\n5.  Test the proxy connection within the browser.\n\n### 4. Best Practices for 2026\n\n\n*   **Use High-Quality Proxies:** For external anonymity, consider using residential or mobile SOCKS5 proxies\n.\n*   **Realistic Fingerprints:** Ensure your antidetect browser generates realistic and consistent browser fingerprints.\n*   \n**Isolate Profiles:** Use separate browser profiles for different accounts to prevent cross-contamination.\n*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your\n antidetect browser and its fingerprint libraries updated.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"how to set up HAPP proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using a SOCKS5 port in an antidetect browser for 2026","timestamp":41907},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search","status":"pending","timestamp":41907},{"type":"tool_call","name":"google_web_search-1769686665887-ecda1e3f24c148","status":"completed","timestamp":41907},{"type":"message","content":"Here","timestamp":41907},{"type":"message","content":" is a guide on how to set up a SOCKS5 proxy with \"Allow connections from LAN\" using an antidetect","timestamp":41907},{"type":"message","content":" browser, based on information relevant for 2026.\n\n### 1.

However\n, I can provide you with a comprehensive guide to managing Terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and Checkov in a\n production environment, based on current best practices and forward-looking trends that are likely to be relevant in 2026.\n\n\n### The Philosophy: Exceptions are Necessary, but Scrutinized\n\nSecurity scanning tools are not perfect. They can\n have false positives, or there might be legitimate business reasons to accept a risk. Therefore, a process for managing exceptions is crucial\n. However, exceptions should be rare, well-documented, and temporary.\n\n### Core Principles for Exception Management\n\n1.  **\nLeast Privilege, Narrowest Scope:** An exception should be as specific as possible, applying only to the resource and rule in\n question. Avoid broad, sweeping exceptions.\n2.  **Clear Justification:** Every exception must have a clear,\n written justification. This should include:\n    *   Why the finding is a false positive or an acceptable risk.\n\n    *   Any compensating controls that are in place.\n    *   The name of the person who is accepting the risk.\n\n3.  **Formal Approval Workflow:** Exceptions should be reviewed and approved by a security team or a designated authority. This should\n be a formal, auditable process.\n4.  **Regular Review and Expiration:** Exceptions should not live forever. They should\n have an expiration date and be reviewed periodically to see if they are still valid.\n\n### Tool-Specific Guidance\n\nBoth\n `tfsec` and `checkov` offer mechanisms for ignoring findings.\n\n#### **tfsec**\n\n*   **\nIn-code comments:** For ignoring a specific finding on a specific resource, use an ignore comment:\n    \n```terraform\n\n    resource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"my_bucket\" {\n      #tfsec:ignore:\nAWS006\n      bucket = \"my-bucket\"\n      acl    = \"private\"\n    }\n\n    \n```\n\n*   **Configuration Files:** For broader ignores (e.g., ignoring a rule across an entire module\n), you can use a configuration file (`.tfsec/config.yml`).\n\n#### **Checkov**\n\n*   **\nIn-code comments:** Similar to tfsec, you can use comments to skip checks:\n    \n```terraform\n    resource\n \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"my_bucket\" {\n      #checkov:skip=CKV_\nAWS_20: \"Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest\"\n      bucket =\n \"my-bucket\"\n      acl    = \"private\"\n    }\n    \n```\n\n*   **Configuration\n Files:** Checkov also supports configuration files for more complex scenarios.\n\n### Baseline Management in 2026:\n Policy as Code and GitOps\n\nBy 2026, the management of security scanning baselines will be heavily\n reliant on Policy as Code (PaC) and GitOps principles.\n\n*   **Policy as Code (PaC):**\n Your security policies, including your exceptions, should be defined as code and stored in a version control system (like Git). This provides\n an audit trail and allows for automated testing of your policies.\n*   **GitOps:** The Git repository becomes the single\n source of truth for your security policies. Any changes to the policies, including adding or removing exceptions, are done through a pull\n request (PR) workflow.\n\n### A Suggested Workflow for 2026\n\nHere's a forward-looking workflow\n that combines these principles:\n\n1.  **Developer Identifies a Finding:** A developer runs `tfsec` or\n `checkov` locally and identifies a finding that they believe is a false positive or an acceptable risk.\n2.  **\nIn-Code Ignore:** The developer adds an in-code ignore comment to the Terraform code.\n3.  **Pull\n Request:** The developer opens a pull request with the change.\n4.  **Automated Scanning:** The CI/CD pipeline automatically\n runs `tfsec` and `checkov`. The pipeline is configured to fail if there are any new ignores that have\n not been justified.\n5.  **Justification as Code:** To justify the ignore, the developer adds an entry to a dedicated\n YAML file in the repository (e.g., `security/exceptions.yml`):\n    \n```yaml\n    -\n id: CKV_AWS_20\n      resource: aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket\n      just\nification: \"This bucket is used for public, non-sensitive data.\"\n      approved_by: \"security-\nteam@example.com\"\n      expiration_date: \"2026-12-31\"\n\n    \n```\n\n6.  **Security Team Review:** The security team is automatically added as a reviewer on the PR. They\n review the justification and approve the PR if it is valid.\n7.  **Merge and Update Baseline:** Once the PR is merged\n, the baseline is updated. The CI/CD pipeline will no longer fail for this specific ignore.\n8.  **Automated\n Expiration Reminders:** An automated process (e.g., a scheduled job) periodically scans the `exceptions.yml` file and\n creates tickets or sends notifications for exceptions that are nearing their expiration date.\n\nThis workflow ensures that exceptions are managed in a\n transparent, auditable, and automated way, which will be the standard for infrastructure as code security in 2026 and beyond\n.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"How to manage terraform security scanning baseline exceptions for tfsec and checkov in production for 2026?","timestamp":32698},{"type":"message","content":"I use `ls -F` to survey the current directory's file structure, informing where","timestamp":32698},{"type":"message","content":" to focus my modifications.","timestamp":32698},{"type":"tool_call","name":"run_shell_command","status":"pending","timestamp":32698},{"type":"tool_call","name":"run_shell_command-1769686880002-23016bb3dd5d9","status":"completed","timestamp":32698},{"type":"message","content":"I can","timestamp":32698},{"type":"message","content":"'t directly modify the codebase to answer this \"how-to\" question about Terraform security scanning.
