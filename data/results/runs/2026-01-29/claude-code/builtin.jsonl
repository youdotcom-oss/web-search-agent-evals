{"id":"websearch-2","input":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","output":"Based on my research, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026:\n\n## Landing Page Strategies for 2026\n\n**Core Conversion Principles:**\n- **Mobile-First Approach**: 83% of landing page visits happen on mobile devices. Design for mobile first, then scale up\n- **Speed Optimization**: Pages must load in under 3 seconds (53% of users abandon slower sites). Use WebP/AVIF formats and minify resources\n- **Message Match**: Landing pages should mirror the ad/link that brought visitors, using identical headlines and offers to reduce bounce rates\n- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Critical elements (headline, benefits, CTA) must be above the fold with minimal distractions\n- **AI-Powered Optimization**: Modern landing pages leverage AI for layout decisions and meet Google Core Web Vitals standards\n\n**Psychological Triggers:**\n- Social proof to reduce doubt\n- Urgency to trigger action\n- Clear benefits over features\n- Single, focused CTA (multiple CTAs reduce conversions by 10%)\n- Strategic white space to guide attention\n\n**Continuous Improvement:**\n- A/B testing is essential for data-driven optimization\n- Audience segmentation with tailored messaging per segment\n- Video integration (30s-2min clips can boost conversions by 86%)\n\n## Responsive Gallery Design Patterns\n\n**Layout Options:**\n- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Modern standard for responsive galleries\n- **Masonry Layout**: Pinterest-style with fixed width, variable heights that minimize gaps\n- **Quilted Layout**: Google Photos style with mixed sizes\n- **Uniform Grid**: Fixed dimensions for consistency\n\n**2026 Best Practices:**\n- **Container Queries**: Now mainstream for truly modular components\n- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when entering viewport (critical for performance)\n- **Fluid Design**: Build for any screen size, not specific breakpoints (67% of traffic is mobile, 75%+ for retail/entertainment)\n- **Performance Metrics**: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms\n\n**Modern CSS Features:**\n- `:has()` selector for parent-based styling\n- Subgrid for nested layouts\n- Variable fonts for typography\n- Content-first breakpoints (adjust where content requires it)\n\n## Responsive Pricing Table Patterns\n\n**Popular 2026 Designs:**\n\n1. **Toggle-Based Tables**: Monthly/yearly billing switches with checkbox-based interactions and \"Best Value\" highlighting via scale transforms\n2. **Card-Based Layout**: Each plan in its own bordered card for easy comparison\n3. **Minimal/Clean**: Maximum white space, essential information only\n4. **Multicolor**: Distinct colors per tier to draw attention\n5. **Glassmorphism**: Modern depth effects for visual appeal\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- **CSS Grid**: Structural foundation for responsive behavior\n- **CSS Custom Properties**: Easy theming and consistency\n- **Sticky Headers**: `position: sticky` for comparison during scrolling\n- **Responsive Breakdowns**: Table elements stack into rows on smaller screens\n- **Mobile-First Structure**: Vertical stacking on mobile, horizontal comparison on desktop\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- Start with mobile vertical layouts\n- Use semantic HTML for accessibility\n- Highlight recommended/popular plans with visual emphasis\n- Include clear feature comparisons\n- Make CTAs prominent in each pricing tier\n\nSources:\n- [Leadfeeder | 12 Landing Page Best Practices of 2026](https://www.leadfeeder.com/blog/landing-pages-convert/)\n- [Best 20 Landing Page Optimization Practices for

The architecture includes:\n\n1. **Router** - Decides if the query needs retrieval\n2. **Retriever** - Fetches documents from vector stores\n3. **Grader** - LLM evaluates retrieved document relevance\n4. **Generator** - Synthesizes answers from context\n\n### Context Injection Pattern\n\n```python\n# Typical prompt construction combining retrieved context and user query\nprompt_template = \"\"\"\nSystem: {system_message}\nContext: {retrieved_context}\nUser Query: {user_query}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nComponents operate on `MessagesState` - graph state containing a messages key with a list of chat messages.\n\n### Production Best Practices (2026)\n\n- **Hybrid Search**: Dense embeddings + BM25 for better retrieval\n- **Rerankers**: Use Cohere or BGE models to refine results\n- **Entity-Level Trust Scoring**: Not just document-level validation\n- **Provenance Tracking**: Track every node and edge in graph\n- **Cited Answers**: Link responses to source documents\n- **Critic Loops**: Self-reflection to validate outputs\n- **JSONL Traces**: For evaluation and observability\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nGraphRAG systems in production now require entity-level trust scoring and provenance tracking for every node and edge to ensure reliable, auditable outputs.\n\n## Example Implementation Pattern\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState\n\n# Define checkpointer for persistence\ncheckpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"postgresql://...\")\n\n# Build graph with memory\ngraph = StateGraph(MessagesState)\ngraph.add_node(\"retrieve\", retrieve_documents)\ngraph.add_node(\"grade\", grade_documents)\ngraph.add_node(\"generate\", generate_answer)\n\n# Compile with checkpointer for memory\napp = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n```\n\n## Sources:\n\n- [Memory overview - Docs by LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/memory)\n- [Launching Long-Term Memory Support in LangGraph](https://www.blog.langchain.com/launching-long-term-memory-support-in-langgraph/)\n- [Powering Long-Term Memory for Agents With LangGraph and MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/product-release-announcements/powering-long-term-memory-for-agents-langgraph)\n- [Build a custom RAG agent with LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/agentic-rag)\n- [Building Agentic RAG Systems with LangGraph: The 2026 Guide](https://rahulkolekar.com/building-agentic-rag-systems-with-langgraph/)\n- [GOODBYE BASIC RAG — HELLO AGENTS: THE 2026 PLAYBOOK](https://medium.com/@krtarunsingh/goodbye-basic-rag-hello-agents-the-2026-playbook-python-langgraph-llamaindex-27e9f70f3428)\n- [Persistence - Docs by LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)\n- [Mastering LangGraph Checkpointing: Best Practices for 2025](https://sparkco.ai/blog/mastering-langgraph-checkpointing-best-practices-for-2025)\n- [LangGraph & Redis: Build smarter AI agents with memory & persistence](https://redis.io/blog/langgraph-redis-build-smarter-ai-agents-with-memory-persistence/)","timestamp":45295}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"LangGraph","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769681175585,"end":1769681220879,"firstResponse":45295,"sessionCreation":0,"total":45294},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Reload UFW:\n```bash\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\n## Solution 2: Bind to Localhost\n\nModify your Docker run commands or docker-compose.yml to bind ports to localhost only:\n\n```bash\n# Instead of:\ndocker run -p 8080:80 nginx\n\n# Use:\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 nginx\n```\n\nOr in docker-compose.yml:\n```yaml\nports:\n  - \"127.0.0.1:8080:80\"\n```\n\n## Solution 3: Use UFW-Docker Tool\n\nInstall the automated helper tool:\n\n```bash\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\nsudo ufw-docker install\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n```\n\n## Solution 4: Disable Docker's iptables (Not Recommended)\n\nEdit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"iptables\": false\n}\n```\n\nThen restart Docker:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n**Warning**: This can break container networking and internet access.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Use `ufw route allow` instead of `ufw allow` for Docker services\n- Containers can still communicate within their networks\n- The DOCKER-USER chain solution is the most robust for 2024\n\nSources:\n- [GitHub - chaifeng/ufw-docker: To fix the Docker and UFW security flaw](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker)\n- [Docker and UFW: The Silent Security Hole and How to Fix It | NIMIDAM](https://nimidam.com/docker-and-ufw-the-silent-security-hole-and-how-to-fix-it/)\n- [Why Docker Bypassed My UFW Firewall & How You Can Fix It](https://rithwik.hashnode.dev/how-docker-can-be-sneaky-around-your-ufw-firewall)\n- [Docker Container Published Port Ignoring UFW Rules | Baeldung on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/docker-container-published-port-ignoring-ufw-rules)\n- [Packet filtering and firewalls | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/)\n- [How To Use Docker with a UFW Firewall](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-use-docker-with-a-ufw-firewall/)","timestamp":42847}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"Docker_Networking","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769681535017,"end":1769681577864,"firstResponse":42847,"sessionCreation":0,"total":42847},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Let me break this down:\n\n## 1. Average True Range (ATR) Formula\n\nThe ATR measures market volatility. For each period, you first calculate the True Range (TR), which is the greatest of:\n- Current High - Current Low\n- |Current High - Previous Close|\n- |Current Low - Previous Close|\n\nThen ATR is typically the 14-period moving average of the True Range values.\n\n**Example calculation:**\n```\nTR = max(\n  high - low,\n  abs(high - previous_close),\n  abs(low - previous_close)\n)\n\nATR = (TR₁ + TR₂ + ... + TR₁₄) / 14  // for 14-period ATR\n```\n\n## 2. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) Formula\n\nVWAP uses the typical price and volume:\n\n```\nTypical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3\n\nVWAP = Σ(Typical Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)\n```\n\nThis is calculated cumulatively throughout the trading day, resetting at the start of each new trading session.\n\n## 3.

{"id":"websearch-557","input":"What are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","output":"Based on the latest documentation and community practices, here are the best practices for handling optional array parameters in Supabase RPC functions for pricing overrides:\n\n## Best Practices for Optional Array Parameters\n\n### **1. Use DEFAULT NULL for Optional Parameters**\n\nThis is the recommended approach when absence has semantic meaning:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n  product_id integer,\n  override_ids integer[] DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS TABLE(...) AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF override_ids IS NOT NULL THEN\n    -- Apply specific overrides\n    RETURN QUERY \n    SELECT * FROM pricing \n    WHERE product_id = $1 \n    AND override_id = ANY(override_ids);\n  ELSE\n    -- Return base pricing\n    RETURN QUERY \n    SELECT * FROM pricing WHERE product_id = $1;\n  END IF;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n### **2. Use Empty Array Default**\n\nUse `DEFAULT '{}'` when you want to avoid null checks:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n  product_id integer,\n  override_ids integer[] DEFAULT '{}'\n)\nRETURNS TABLE(...) AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF array_length(override_ids, 1) IS NOT NULL THEN\n    -- Apply overrides\n    RETURN QUERY SELECT * FROM pricing WHERE override_id = ANY(override_ids);\n  ELSE\n    -- Return base pricing\n    RETURN QUERY SELECT * FROM pricing WHERE product_id = $1;\n  END IF;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n### **3. Client-Side Calling**\n\n```javascript\n// With overrides\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  product_id: 123,\n  override_ids: [1, 2, 3]\n});\n\n// Without overrides (uses default)\nconst { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('apply_pricing_overrides', {\n  product_id: 123\n});\n```\n\n### **4. Key Considerations**\n\n- **NULL vs Empty Array**: `NULL` means \"no value provided\", while `'{}'` means \"zero elements\". Choose based on your business logic.\n- **Array Length Check**: Use `array_length(param, 1) IS NOT NULL` rather than direct NULL comparison\n- **Parameter Order**: All parameters after a DEFAULT parameter must also have defaults\n- **STRICT Functions**: If using `STRICT`, the function won't execute if any parameter is NULL (including array parameters)\n- **Security**: Use security invoker (the default) for proper RLS enforcement\n\n### **5. For Complex Override Objects**\n\nUse JSONB for complex pricing override structures:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n  product_id integer,\n  overrides jsonb DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS TABLE(...) AS $$\nBEGIN\n  IF overrides IS NOT NULL THEN\n    -- Process complex override rules\n    -- ...\n  END IF;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\nThe choice between NULL and empty array defaults depends on your use case: use NULL when \"not provided\" has different meaning than \"provided but empty\", and use empty array when you want simpler conditional logic.\n\nSources:\n- [JavaScript API Reference | Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/rpc)\n- [Database Functions | Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/functions)\n- [send array of objects in supabase rpc parameters · supabase · Discussion #3030](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/3030)\n- [PostgreSQL: Documentation: 18: CREATE FUNCTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)\n- [How to Write a PostgreSQL Function with Optional Parameters](https://www.codegenes.net/blog/how-to-write-function-for-optional-parameters-in-postgresql/)\n- [PostgreSQL: Documentation: 12: 9.18.

{"id":"websearch-560","input":"How to use Vercel AI SDK streamText for multimodal content and image support in 2026","output":"## Using Vercel AI SDK streamText for Multimodal Content and Images (2026)\n\nThe Vercel AI SDK provides robust support for multimodal content including images through the `streamText` function. Here's a comprehensive guide:\n\n### Basic Setup\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\nnpm install ai @ai-sdk/openai\n```\n\n### Server-Side Implementation (API Route)\n\nThe server uses `streamText` with `convertToModelMessages` to handle multimodal content:\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nexport const maxDuration = 30;\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n  \n  const result = streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4o'), // or any vision-capable model\n    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n### Message Format with Images\n\nMessages use a **`parts` array** structure to combine text with images:\n\n```typescript\nsendMessage({\n  role: 'user',\n  parts: [\n    { \n      type: 'text', \n      text: 'What is in this image?' \n    },\n    {\n      type: 'file',\n      mediaType: 'image/jpeg',\n      url: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,...' // or http(s):// URL\n    }\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n### Image Format Options\n\nImages can be provided in three formats:\n- **Base64 encoded content**\n- **Data URLs**: `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`\n- **HTTP(S) URLs**: `https://example.com/image.jpg`\n\n### Converting Files to Data URLs\n\n```typescript\nasync function convertFilesToDataURLs(files: FileList) {\n  return Promise.all(\n    Array.from(files).map(file => \n      new Promise((resolve) => {\n        const reader = new FileReader();\n        reader.onload = () => {\n          resolve({\n            type: 'file',\n            mediaType: file.type,\n            url: reader.result\n          });\n        };\n        reader.readAsDataURL(file);\n      })\n    )\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Client-Side Usage with React\n\n```typescript\nimport { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const { messages, input, handleSubmit, sendMessage } = useChat();\n\n  const handleFormSubmit = async (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);\n    const files = formData.get('files') as FileList;\n    \n    const parts = [\n      { type: 'text', text: input }\n    ];\n\n    if (files?.length > 0) {\n      const fileParts = await convertFilesToDataURLs(files);\n      parts.push(...fileParts);\n    }\n\n    sendMessage({ role: 'user', parts });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {messages.map(m => (\n        <div key={m.id}>\n          {m.parts.map((part, i) => {\n            if (part.type === 'text') return <span key={i}>{part.text}</span>;\n            if (part.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')) \n              return <img key={i} src={part.url} alt=\"\" />;\n          })}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      <form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>\n        <input type=\"text\" value={input} />\n        <input type=\"file\" accept=\"image/*\" name=\"files\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-Provider Support\n\nSwitch models easily by changing one line:\n\n```typescript\n// OpenAI\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nconst result = streamText({ model: openai('gpt-4o'), messages });\n\n// Anthropic Claude\nimport { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';\nconst result = streamText({ model: anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'), messages });\n\n// Google Gemini\nimport { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';\nconst result = streamText({ model: google('gemini-1.5-pro'), messages });\n```\n\n### Key Features in 2026\n\n- **Unified API**: Works across multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)\n- **Streaming Support**: Real-time responses with `toUIMessageStreamResponse()`\n- **File Attachments**: Support for images, PDFs, and other media types\n- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing\n- **Flexible Message Format**: Parts-based structure for mixed content\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Use vision-capable models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro)\n- The `convertToModelMessages` helper transforms UI messages to model-compatible formats\n- Images are automatically processed based on their format (base64, data URL, or HTTP URL)\n- The `parts` array can contain multiple images and text segments in a single message\n\n**Sources:**\n- [AI SDK 6 -

Here's a comprehensive guide:\n\n### Basic Setup\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\nnpm install ai @ai-sdk/openai\n```\n\n### Server-Side Implementation (API Route)\n\nThe server uses `streamText` with `convertToModelMessages` to handle multimodal content:\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nexport const maxDuration = 30;\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n  \n  const result = streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4o'), // or any vision-capable model\n    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n### Message Format with Images\n\nMessages use a **`parts` array** structure to combine text with images:\n\n```typescript\nsendMessage({\n  role: 'user',\n  parts: [\n    { \n      type: 'text', \n      text: 'What is in this image?' \n    },\n    {\n      type: 'file',\n      mediaType: 'image/jpeg',\n      url: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,...' // or http(s):// URL\n    }\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n### Image Format Options\n\nImages can be provided in three formats:\n- **Base64 encoded content**\n- **Data URLs**: `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`\n- **HTTP(S) URLs**: `https://example.com/image.jpg`\n\n### Converting Files to Data URLs\n\n```typescript\nasync function convertFilesToDataURLs(files: FileList) {\n  return Promise.all(\n    Array.from(files).map(file => \n      new Promise((resolve) => {\n        const reader = new FileReader();\n        reader.onload = () => {\n          resolve({\n            type: 'file',\n            mediaType: file.type,\n            url: reader.result\n          });\n        };\n        reader.readAsDataURL(file);\n      })\n    )\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Client-Side Usage with React\n\n```typescript\nimport { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const { messages, input, handleSubmit, sendMessage } = useChat();\n\n  const handleFormSubmit = async (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);\n    const files = formData.get('files') as FileList;\n    \n    const parts = [\n      { type: 'text', text: input }\n    ];\n\n    if (files?.length > 0) {\n      const fileParts = await convertFilesToDataURLs(files);\n      parts.push(...fileParts);\n    }\n\n    sendMessage({ role: 'user', parts });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {messages.map(m => (\n        <div key={m.id}>\n          {m.parts.map((part, i) => {\n            if (part.type === 'text') return <span key={i}>{part.text}</span>;\n            if (part.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')) \n              return <img key={i} src={part.url} alt=\"\" />;\n          })}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      <form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>\n        <input type=\"text\" value={input} />\n        <input type=\"file\" accept=\"image/*\" name=\"files\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-Provider Support\n\nSwitch models easily by changing one line:\n\n```typescript\n// OpenAI\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nconst result = streamText({ model: openai('gpt-4o'), messages });\n\n// Anthropic Claude\nimport { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';\nconst result = streamText({ model: anthropic('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'), messages });\n\n// Google Gemini\nimport { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';\nconst result = streamText({ model: google('gemini-1.5-pro'), messages });\n```\n\n### Key Features in 2026\n\n- **Unified API**: Works across multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)\n- **Streaming Support**: Real-time responses with `toUIMessageStreamResponse()`\n- **File Attachments**: Support for images, PDFs, and other media types\n- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing\n- **Flexible Message Format**: Parts-based structure for mixed content\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Use vision-capable models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro)\n- The `convertToModelMessages` helper transforms UI messages to model-compatible formats\n- Images are automatically processed based on their format (base64, data URL, or HTTP URL)\n- The `parts` array can contain multiple images and text segments in a single message\n\n**Sources:**\n- [AI SDK 6 -

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"How to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"Based on the latest information from 2026, here's how to handle Clerk webhook events for organization lifecycle events:\n\n## Setting Up Organization Webhooks in Clerk\n\n### 1. Configure Webhook Endpoint in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to the **Webhooks** page in your Clerk Dashboard\n2. Click **Add Endpoint**\n3. Enter your webhook endpoint URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`)\n4. In the **Message Filtering** section, select the organization events:\n   - `organization.created`\n   - `organization.updated`\n   - `organization.deleted`\n5. Copy the **Signing Secret** and add it to your environment variables as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`\n\n### 2. Implementation Example (Next.js App Router)\n\nHere's a complete example for handling organization webhook events:\n\n```typescript\n// app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/backend/webhooks';\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers';\n\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  try {\n    // Verify the webhook signature\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(request);\n    \n    const eventType = evt.type;\n    const eventData = evt.data;\n\n    // Handle organization events\n    switch (eventType) {\n      case 'organization.created':\n        console.log('Organization created:', eventData.id);\n        // Sync to your database\n        await createOrganizationInDB({\n          clerkOrgId: eventData.id,\n          name: eventData.name,\n          slug: eventData.slug,\n          createdAt: eventData.created_at,\n          // Add other fields as needed\n        });\n        break;\n\n      case 'organization.updated':\n        console.log('Organization updated:', eventData.id);\n        // Update your database\n        await updateOrganizationInDB({\n          clerkOrgId: eventData.id,\n          name: eventData.name,\n          slug: eventData.slug,\n          // Add other fields as needed\n        });\n        break;\n\n      case 'organization.deleted':\n        console.log('Organization deleted:', eventData.id);\n        // Handle deletion in your database\n        await deleteOrganizationInDB(eventData.id);\n        break;\n\n      default:\n        console.log('Unhandled event type:', eventType);\n    }\n\n    return new Response('Webhook processed successfully', { status: 200 });\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Webhook verification failed:', err);\n    return new Response('Webhook verification failed', { status: 400 });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Alternative: Using Svix Directly\n\n```typescript\nimport { Webhook } from 'svix';\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers';\nimport { WebhookEvent } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';\n\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  const webhookSecret = process.env.CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET;\n  \n  if (!webhookSecret) {\n    throw new Error('Missing CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET');\n  }\n\n  const payloadString = await request.text();\n  const headerPayload = headers();\n  \n  const svixHeaders = {\n    'svix-id': headerPayload.get('svix-id')!,\n    'svix-timestamp': headerPayload.get('svix-timestamp')!,\n    'svix-signature': headerPayload.get('svix-signature')!,\n  };\n\n  const wh = new Webhook(webhookSecret);\n  const evt = wh.verify(payloadString, svixHeaders) as WebhookEvent;\n\n  // Handle organization events\n  if (evt.type === 'organization.created') {\n    // Handle creation\n  }\n\n  return Response.json({ message: 'Received' });\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Important Considerations\n\n- **Async & Eventually Consistent**: Webhooks are delivered quickly but not instantaneously. Your data sync is eventually consistent.\n- **Automatic Retries**: Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff, so you won't miss events.\n- **Security**: Always verify webhook signatures to prevent malicious requests.\n- **Local Testing**: Use ngrok to forward webhooks to your local development server.\n\n### 5. Environment Variables\n\n```env\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_xxx...\n```\n\n### 6. Additional Organization Events\n\nWhen an organization is created, Clerk also fires:\n- `organization.created` - The organization itself\n- `organizationMembership.created` - The creator's membership\n\nThis allows you to track both the organization and its initial member.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Clerk Webhooks Overview](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks/overview)\n- [Sync Clerk data to your app with webhooks](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/webhooks/syncing)\n- [Clerk Webhooks: Getting Started](https://clerk.com/blog/webhooks-getting-started)\n- [SDK Reference: verifyWebhook()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/verify-webhook)\n- [Handling Clerk webhook events - Inngest Documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/clerk-webhook-events)\n- [Using Clerk Authentication Webhooks with Next.js](https://dev.to/mihir_bhadak/using-clerk-authentication-webhooks-with-nextjs-sync-clerk-data-to-your-database-2pni)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you handle Clerk webhook events for organization lifecycle events in 2026.

Apps must handle drawing behind system bars, or portions of your UI may be hidden.\n\n## Primary Inset Types\n\n### System UI Insets\n- **`WindowInsets.statusBars`** - Top system bars with notifications\n- **`WindowInsets.navigationBars`** - Bottom/side navigation UI (taskbar/navigation icons)\n- **`WindowInsets.systemBars`** - Union of status bars, navigation bars, and caption bar\n\n### Gesture & Touch Insets\n- **`WindowInsets.systemGestures`** - Areas where the system intercepts gestures for navigation\n- **`WindowInsets.mandatorySystemGestures`** - System gesture areas that cannot be opted out (introduced in Android 10)\n- **`WindowInsets.tappableElement`** - Navigation UI areas where taps are handled by the system\n\n### Recommended Safe Insets (Best Practice)\n- **`WindowInsets.safeDrawing`** - Prevents content from being obscured by system UI (most common)\n- **`WindowInsets.safeGestures`** - Protects interactive content from system gesture conflicts\n- **`WindowInsets.safeContent`** - Combines both safeDrawing and safeGestures for complete protection\n\n## Navigation Bar & Gesture Handling Guidelines\n\n1. **Use `WindowInsets.safeGestures`** to protect gesture-based UI from conflicts with system gestures\n2. **Query `getMandatorySystemGestureInsets()`** to understand touch recognition thresholds\n3. **Use `Window.setSystemGestureExclusionRects()`** for apps (especially games) that need to exclude specific areas during gameplay\n4. **Apply proper offsets** to ensure critical UI elements and touch targets aren't positioned behind navigation bars\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use `enableEdgeToEdge()`** instead of `setDecorFitsSystemWindows()` - it encapsulates ~100 lines of backward-compatible code\n2. **Use Material 3 Scaffold components** - they automatically handle Android 15 edge-to-edge enforcement\n3. **Test across device types** - phones, tablets, foldables, and different form factors\n4. **Handle visibility variants** - Use `IgnoringVisibility` variants (e.g., `navigationBarsIgnoringVisibility`) for consistent sizing even in immersive mode\n\n## Implementation Pattern\n\n```kotlin\n// Recommended approach\nSpacer(modifier = Modifier.windowInsetsBottomHeight(WindowInsets.safeContent))\n```\n\nSources:\n- [About window insets | Jetpack Compose | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/system/insets)\n- [Lay out your app within window insets | Views | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/insets)\n- [Gesture Navigation: handling visual overlaps (II) | by Chris Banes | Android Developers | Medium](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/gesture-navigation-handling-visual-overlaps-4aed565c134c)\n- [Ensure compatibility with gesture navigation | Views | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/gestures/gesturenav)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the 2026 guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets.","timestamp":62274},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":62274},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SZfUSfLdT9udksVGi3fVen","status":"completed","timestamp":62274},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":62274},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Ry5rGzCf9PZndEg6327Gk5","status":"completed","timestamp":62274},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":62274},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WdSmgtf3sQHG4xpBag5f4V","status":"completed","timestamp":62274},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":62274},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KtwmQjRBCcWzsqbsRbeJxP","status":"completed","timestamp":62274},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest Android documentation (updated for 2026), here are the current guidelines for Android handset inset handling and navigation bar gesture insets:\n\n## Key Changes for 2026\n\n**Android 15+ (API 35) Enforcement**: Edge-to-edge is now enforced by default.

Interrupts require persistence\n2. **Use JSON-serializable values** - No functions, class instances, or complex objects\n3. **Don't wrap in try/except** - This catches the internal exception that triggers pausing\n4. **Keep code before interrupt() idempotent** -

{"id":"websearch-965","input":"how to fix pytorch model loading getting stuck in a deadlock when using multiprocessing in 2026","output":"Based on the latest information, here are the most effective solutions to fix PyTorch model loading deadlocks with multiprocessing in 2026:\n\n## Primary Solutions\n\n**1. Use 'spawn' instead of 'fork' start method**\n\nThe most reliable fix is to use the `spawn` start method instead of the default `fork`:\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn')\n    # Your multiprocessing code here\n```\n\nOr use a context:\n```python\nctx = mp.get_context('spawn')\nprocess = ctx.Process(target=worker_fn, args=(...))\n```\n\n**2. Load state_dict inside worker processes**\n\nInstead of loading the model in the main process, load it after spawning:\n\n```python\ndef worker_fn(rank, checkpoint_path):\n    # Initialize model in worker\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(checkpoint_path))\n    model.to(f'cuda:{rank}')\n    # Continue training...\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.spawn(worker_fn, args=(checkpoint_path,), nprocs=world_size)\n```\n\n**3. Use SimpleQueue instead of Queue**\n\nIf passing data between processes, use `SimpleQueue` which doesn't spawn background threads:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import SimpleQueue\nqueue = SimpleQueue()  # Instead of mp.Queue()\n```\n\n**4. Pass state_dict, not the model object**\n\nWhen sharing model weights, pass only the state dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Don't do this:\n# mp.spawn(worker, args=(model,))\n\n# Do this instead:\nstate_dict = model.state_dict()\nmp.spawn(worker, args=(state_dict,))\n```\n\n**5. Set thread limits to avoid CPU oversubscription**\n\n```python\nimport torch\ntorch.set_num_threads(num_cpus // num_processes)\n```\n\n## Why These Work\n\nThe deadlock typically occurs because:\n- Fork copies the parent process state including locks that may be held\n- Background threads in PyTorch/CUDA runtime don't play well with fork\n- CUDA runtime explicitly doesn't support fork\n\nThe `spawn` method starts fresh processes, avoiding these issues entirely.\n\nSources:\n- [PyTorch Multiprocessing Best Practices](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html)\n- [Load_state_dict causing deadlock in multiprocessing training - PyTorch Forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/load-state-dict-causing-deadlock-in-multiprocessing-training/191333)\n- [Torch.multiprocessing.spawn can deadlock · Issue #41694](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/41694)\n- [Deadlock when loading the model in multiprocessing context · Issue #15976](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/15976)\n- [Deadlock with multiprocessing (using fork) and OpenMP · Issue #17199](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/17199)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you resolve PyTorch model loading deadlocks with multiprocessing.

{"id":"websearch-990","input":"What are the latest data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025?","output":"Based on the latest research, here are the key data selection techniques for LLM reasoning using reinforcement learning in 2024 and 2025:\n\n## Dynamic Data Selection & Sampling\n\n**Dynamic Sampling (DAPO)**: Filters diverse datasets down to smaller candidate sets based on diversity and quality metrics, then dynamically samples within difficulty levels using effectiveness scoring. This approach filters out zero-variance prompts and refills training batches through resampling to improve training efficiency.\n\n**Difficulty-Aware Selection (GRPO-LEAD)**: Introduced difficulty-aware reinforcement learning that selects data based on problem complexity to enable more concise mathematical reasoning.\n\n**SELF (Selective Examples with Low-likelihood and Forward-KL)**: A data curation algorithm that selectively focuses on problems with low likelihood of arriving at correct answers while preserving previously learned behavior. This improves sample efficiency and mitigates coverage shrinkage during RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards).\n\n## Key Algorithmic Approaches\n\n**Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: Used by DeepSeek-R1 and introduced in DeepSeekMath (2024), this variant of PPO enhances mathematical reasoning while optimizing memory by dropping the critic/value model. GRPO has become foundational for reasoning model development.\n\n**RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards)**: Emerged as the de facto training stage in 2025 for developing reasoning capabilities, particularly for tasks with verifiable outcomes like mathematics.\n\n**Asynchronous RLHF**: Research from ICLR 2025 shows that online, on-policy data generated by the model being trained is crucial for achieving high reward while maintaining pretrained capabilities.\n\n## Data Quality & Curation Principles\n\n**High-Quality Dataset Curation**: The methodology emphasizes careful selection and filtering of prompts and responses, with attention to data mixture and training recipes. Research shows that even minimal but carefully curated human-annotated data can achieve strong performance.\n\n**Addressing Winner-Take-All Phenomenon**: RLVR can disproportionately reinforce problems with high likelihood under the base model while suppressing initially low-likelihood ones. Modern techniques address this inherent on-policy sampling bias.\n\n**Safe RLHF**: Decouples data annotation for helpfulness and harmlessness, training separate preference models and dynamically integrating them during policy optimization.\n\n## Emerging Techniques (2024-2025)\n\nSeveral advanced methods have emerged: VinePPO, VC-PPO, VAPO, and DAPO, all focused on improving RL for reasoning through better data selection and sampling strategies.\n\nThe field has shifted toward combining sophisticated data selection with reinforcement learning, particularly for mathematical problem-solving.

{"id":"websearch-1049","input":"How to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","output":"# Web Push Notifications for Safari iOS 16.4+ Setup Guide\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide to setting up web push notifications for iOS Safari 16.4+ using the Add to Home Screen Push API:\n\n## Critical Requirements\n\n### 1. Add to Home Screen (PWA) Requirement\n**Web push only works for Home Screen web apps on iOS**, not in Safari browser directly. Users must:\n- Visit your website\n- Tap the Share button\n- Select \"Add to Home Screen\"\n\n### 2. Web App Manifest\nYour `manifest.json` must include:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"App\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe `\"display\": \"standalone\"` or `\"display\": \"fullscreen\"` is **required** - this makes it function as a web app rather than just a bookmark.\n\n### 3. HTTPS Required\nYour site must be served over HTTPS (except localhost for development).\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Generate VAPID Keys\n\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\nThis generates:\n- **Public key** (use in frontend)\n- **Private key** (keep secure on backend)\n\n### Step 2: Register Service Worker\n\n```javascript\n// In your main JavaScript file\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Request Permission and Subscribe\n\n```javascript\nconst VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';\n\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  try {\n    // Wait for service worker to be ready\n    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n    \n    // Check if push manager exists (only after Add to Home Screen)\n    if (!registration.pushManager) {\n      alert('Please add this app to your Home Screen first');\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    // Request notification permission\n    const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n    if (permission !== 'granted') {\n      console.log('Notification permission denied');\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    // Subscribe to push notifications\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY)\n    });\n    \n    console.log('Push subscription:', subscription.toJSON());\n    \n    // Send subscription to your backend\n    await sendSubscriptionToBackend(subscription);\n    \n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to subscribe:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Helper function to convert VAPID key\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/\\-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\nasync function sendSubscriptionToBackend(subscription) {\n  await fetch('/api/push-subscribe', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify(subscription)\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create Service Worker (sw.js)\n\n```javascript\n// sw.js\nself.addEventListener('push', function(event) {\n  console.log('Push received:', event);\n  \n  let data = {};\n  if (event.data) {\n    data = event.data.json();\n  }\n  \n  const title = data.title || 'New Notification';\n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || 'You have a new message',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: '/badge-72x72.png',\n    data: {\n      url: data.url || '/'\n    },\n    tag: data.tag || 'default-tag',\n    requireInteraction: false\n  };\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(title, options)\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', function(event) {\n  console.log('Notification clicked:', event);\n  event.notification.close();\n  \n  const urlToOpen = event.notification.data.url || '/';\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.matchAll({ type: 'window', includeUncontrolled: true })\n      .then(windowClients => {\n        // Check if there's already a window open\n        for (let client of windowClients) {\n          if (client.url === urlToOpen && 'focus' in client) {\n            return client.focus();\n          }\n        }\n        // Open new window if none exists\n        if (clients.openWindow) {\n          return clients.openWindow(urlToOpen);\n        }\n      })\n  );\n});\n```\n\n### Step 5: Backend Server Implementation (Node.js Example)\n\n```javascript\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\n// Set VAPID keys\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY,\n  VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY\n);\n\n// Store subscriptions in database\napp.post('/api/push-subscribe', async (req, res) => {\n  const subscription = req.body;\n  // Save subscription to database\n  await saveSubscription(subscription);\n  res.status(201).json({ success: true });\n});\n\n// Send push notification\nasync function sendPushNotification(subscription, payload) {\n  try {\n    await webpush.sendNotification(subscription, JSON.stringify({\n      title: 'Hello!',\n      body: 'This is a push notification',\n      icon: '/icon-192x192.png',\n      url: 'https://yoursite.com/page'\n    }));\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error sending push:', error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## New: Declarative Web Push (iOS 18.4+)\n\nFor iOS 18.4+ (2025), you can use the new Declarative Web Push API:\n\n### Subscribe Without Service Worker\n\n```javascript\n// Direct access via window.pushManager\nconst subscription = await window.pushManager.subscribe({\n  userVisibleOnly: true,\n  applicationServerKey: VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY_ARRAY\n});\n```\n\n### Send Declarative Push Payload\n\n```json\n{\n  \"web_push\": 8030,\n  \"notification\": {\n    \"title\": \"Example Notification\",\n    \"body\": \"Your notification message\",\n    \"navigate\": \"https://example.com/target-page\",\n    \"silent\": false,\n    \"app_badge\": \"1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe declarative approach is more battery-efficient and doesn't require JavaScript execution to display notifications.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. **Testing**: `pushManager` only appears after adding to Home Screen. You can check installation status:\n```javascript\nif (window.navigator.standalone) {\n  console.log('Running as installed PWA');\n}\n```\n\n2. **Server Whitelisting**: If you control push endpoints, whitelist `*.push.apple.com` URLs.\n\n3. **Permissions**: Users manage notifications in iOS Settings → Your App → Notifications.\n\n4. **Focus Mode**: Include an `id` member in your manifest for Focus mode synchronization.\n\n5. **Browser Support**: Works in Safari, Chrome, and Edge on iOS 16.4+.\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Apple Developer Documentation - Sending web push notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending-web-push-notifications-in-web-apps-and-browsers)\n- [WebKit - Web Push for Web Apps on iOS and iPadOS](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/)\n- [WebKit - Meet Declarative Web Push](https://webkit.org/blog/16535/meet-declarative-web-push/)\n- [GitHub - webpush-ios-example](https://github.com/andreinwald/webpush-ios-example)\n- [MoEngage - Safari Web Push for iOS and iPadOS](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/13906923326100-Safari-Web-Push-for-iOS-and-iPadOS)\n- [OneSignal - iOS web push setup](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/en/web-push-for-ios)\n- [PushAlert - Setup Web Push on iOS](https://pushalert.co/documentation/ios-web-push)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest documentation on setting up web push notifications for Safari on iOS 16.4+ using the Add to Home Screen Push API.","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":92898},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HuTJJwxRMh995TL11x63uV","status":"completed","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":92898},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01AbLP9ePgyPHauKD11hFXrE","status":"completed","timestamp":92898},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017boJwYg5J7oVnp9i5RmE1o","status":"completed","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more detailed technical implementation examples:","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":92898},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01J6LJCa4V9mruoe1PbhfwM4","status":"completed","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":92898},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QTNhByF1o3bANmMaiAC8BW","status":"completed","timestamp":92898},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WHsopyqQS1MzhzwNwN47AY","status":"completed","timestamp":92898},{"type":"message","content":"# Web Push Notifications for Safari iOS 16.4+ Setup Guide\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide to setting up web push notifications for iOS Safari 16.4+ using the Add to Home Screen Push API:\n\n## Critical Requirements\n\n### 1.

This will:\n- Create a new monorepo with two workspaces: `web` and `ui`\n- Set up Turborepo as the build system\n- Configure everything automatically\n\n## Method 2: Manual Setup in Existing Turborepo\n\n### 1. Project Structure\n\nCreate this structure:\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/              # Your Next.js/React app\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/               # Shared UI components\n├── package.json\n└── turbo.json\n```\n\n### 2. Initialize shadcn/ui in Each Workspace\n\nIn your app directory (`apps/web`):\n```bash\ncd apps/web\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nIn your shared UI package (`packages/ui`):\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\n### 3.

This will:\n- Create a new monorepo with two workspaces: `web` and `ui`\n- Set up Turborepo as the build system\n- Configure everything automatically\n\n## Method 2: Manual Setup in Existing Turborepo\n\n### 1. Project Structure\n\nCreate this structure:\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── apps/\n│   └── web/              # Your Next.js/React app\n├── packages/\n│   └── ui/               # Shared UI components\n├── package.json\n└── turbo.json\n```\n\n### 2. Initialize shadcn/ui in Each Workspace\n\nIn your app directory (`apps/web`):\n```bash\ncd apps/web\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nIn your shared UI package (`packages/ui`):\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\n### 3. Configure components.json\n\nEach workspace needs its own `components.json` file with appropriate paths:\n\n**For apps/web/components.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"default\",\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.ts\",\n    \"css\": \"app/globals.css\"\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For packages/ui/components.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"default\",\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.ts\",\n    \"css\": \"src/index.css\"\n  },\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4.

Here's how to fix it:\n\n## Primary Solution: Remove Custom Start Command\n\nThe most common fix is to **remove your custom start command** from Railway's service settings:\n\n1. Go to your Railway service settings\n2. Find the \"Start Command\" field\n3. Clear/remove any custom start command you've set\n4. Let Railway use the default CMD/ENTRYPOINT from your Dockerfile\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nRailway's custom start command overrides the container's ENTRYPOINT in exec form. When you include shell commands like `cd` in the start command, they fail because:\n- The `cd` command is a shell builtin, not an executable\n- Railway expects direct executable commands, not shell operations\n- Commands in exec form don't support shell operations\n\n## Dockerfile Best Practices\n\nIf using a Dockerfile, ensure you have proper CMD or ENTRYPOINT directives:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Good examples:\nCMD [\"node\", \"index.js\"]\nCMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\nCMD [\"./app\"]\n\n# Avoid shell operations in Railway start commands:\n# BAD: \"cd /app && node index.js\"\n```\n\n## Alternative Fix: Use Shell Form\n\nIf you need to use shell commands (like `cd` or environment variable expansion), wrap your command in a shell:\n\n```dockerfile\nCMD [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"cd /app && node index.js\"]\n```\n\nThis provides a shell environment where `cd` and other builtins are available.\n\nSources:\n- [The executable 'cd' could not be found - Railway Help Station](https://station.railway.com/questions/the-executable-cd-could-not-be-found-2c441b11)\n- [Issue in creating containers - Railway Help Station](https://station.railway.com/questions/issue-in-creating-containers-ee70c1a1)\n- [Build keeps failing - Railway Help Station](https://station.railway.com/questions/build-keeps-failing-6647eb88)\n- [Set a Start Command | Railway Docs](https://docs.railway.com/guides/start-command)\n- [Build from a Dockerfile | Railway Docs](https://docs.railway.com/guides/dockerfiles)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll help you investigate this \"cd could not be found\" error in Railway containers.

Let Railway use the default CMD/ENTRYPOINT from your Dockerfile\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nRailway's custom start command overrides the container's ENTRYPOINT in exec form. When you include shell commands like `cd` in the start command, they fail because:\n- The `cd` command is a shell builtin, not an executable\n- Railway expects direct executable commands, not shell operations\n- Commands in exec form don't support shell operations\n\n## Dockerfile Best Practices\n\nIf using a Dockerfile, ensure you have proper CMD or ENTRYPOINT directives:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Good examples:\nCMD [\"node\", \"index.js\"]\nCMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\nCMD [\"./app\"]\n\n# Avoid shell operations in Railway start commands:\n# BAD: \"cd /app && node index.js\"\n```\n\n## Alternative Fix: Use Shell Form\n\nIf you need to use shell commands (like `cd` or environment variable expansion), wrap your command in a shell:\n\n```dockerfile\nCMD [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"cd /app && node index.js\"]\n```\n\nThis provides a shell environment where `cd` and other builtins are available.\n\nSources:\n- [The executable 'cd' could not be found - Railway Help Station](https://station.railway.com/questions/the-executable-cd-could-not-be-found-2c441b11)\n- [Issue in creating containers - Railway Help Station](https://station.railway.com/questions/issue-in-creating-containers-ee70c1a1)\n- [Build keeps failing - Railway Help Station](https://station.railway.com/questions/build-keeps-failing-6647eb88)\n- [Set a Start Command | Railway Docs](https://docs.railway.com/guides/start-command)\n- [Build from a Dockerfile | Railway Docs](https://docs.railway.com/guides/dockerfiles)","timestamp":31080}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"Railway_Deployment","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769685805234,"end":1769685836314,"firstResponse":31080,"sessionCreation":0,"total":31080},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1470","input":"How to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","output":"I'll help you understand the best practices for handling React onClick interactions for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026.\n\n## Current Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Use the `<label>` element properly (Recommended)**\nThe most accessible and React-friendly approach is to wrap your checkbox with a `<label>` or use the `htmlFor` attribute:\n\n```jsx\n// Option 1: Wrapping (Recommended)\n<label className=\"checkbox-wrapper\">\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isChecked} onChange={handleChange} />\n  <span>Accept terms</span>\n</label>\n\n// Option 2: Using htmlFor\n<>\n  <input \n    id=\"terms\" \n    type=\"checkbox\" \n    checked={isChecked} \n    onChange={handleChange} \n  />\n  <label htmlFor=\"terms\">Accept terms</label>\n</>\n```\n\n**Why this works:** Clicking the label automatically toggles the checkbox - no `onClick` needed on the label.\n\n### 2. **Use `onChange` instead of `onClick`**\nFor checkboxes, always use `onChange` rather than `onClick`:\n\n```jsx\nfunction CheckboxComponent() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setIsChecked(e.target.checked);\n    // Additional logic here\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input \n        type=\"checkbox\" \n        checked={isChecked} \n        onChange={handleChange} \n      />\n      Accept terms\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**\n\n```jsx\n// Controlled (Recommended for most cases)\n<input \n  type=\"checkbox\" \n  checked={isChecked} \n  onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)} \n/>\n\n// Uncontrolled (for simple forms)\n<input \n  type=\"checkbox\" \n  defaultChecked={false} \n  ref={checkboxRef}\n/>\n```\n\n### 4. **Handling Complex Interactions**\n\nIf you need custom behavior on label click:\n\n```jsx\nfunction ComplexCheckbox() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setIsChecked(e.target.checked);\n  };\n\n  const handleLabelClick = (e) => {\n    // Only runs when label text is clicked\n    // The checkbox toggle still works automatically\n    console.log('Label clicked');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <label onClick={handleLabelClick}>\n      <input \n        type=\"checkbox\" \n        checked={isChecked} \n        onChange={handleChange} \n      />\n      <span>Click me</span>\n    </label>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Preventing Double-Firing**\n\nIf you have both `onChange` on input and `onClick` on label, you might get double events:\n\n```jsx\n// ❌ Avoid this -

Here's how it works in 2024:\n\n## Overview\n\nThis technique leverages the legitimate Windows API function `LoadLibraryEx` with specific flags to load a \"decoy\" DLL in a way that allows an attacker to hollow out its memory and replace it with malicious code.\n\n## Technical Process\n\n### 1. **Loading the Decoy DLL**\n```\nLoadLibraryEx(\"decoy.dll\", NULL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES)\n```\n- Uses the `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES` flag (or `LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE`)\n- Loads the DLL without executing `DllMain` or resolving imports\n- Maps the DLL into memory but doesn't initialize it\n- Creates a legitimate-looking memory region\n\n### 2. **Memory Hollowing Steps**\n\n**a) Obtain Base Address**\n- Get the base address of the loaded decoy DLL\n- Identify the size and layout of the mapped memory region\n\n**b) Change Memory Protections**\n```\nVirtualProtect(baseAddress, size, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldProtect)\n```\n- Modify memory protections to allow writing\n- Target the entire PE image or specific sections (.text, .rdata)\n\n**c) Overwrite the Decoy**\n- Replace the decoy DLL's code sections with malicious payload\n- Can overwrite the entire PE or just specific sections\n- Maintains the PE header structure to appear legitimate\n\n**d) Fix Imports/Relocations (Optional)**\n- Resolve imports for the malicious payload\n- Apply relocations if needed\n- Can manually resolve APIs to avoid IAT detection\n\n### 3. **Execution**\n\nTwo primary execution methods:\n\n**Method A: Direct Execution**\n- Call entry point of the hollowed code directly\n- `((void(*)())entryPoint)()`\n\n**Method B: Thread Creation**\n- Create a remote thread pointing to the injected code\n- `CreateRemoteThread()` or `NtCreateThreadEx()`\n\n## Evasion Characteristics (2024)\n\n### Why It's Effective:\n\n1. **Legitimate API Usage**: `LoadLibraryEx` is a standard Windows function\n2. **Signed Decoy**: Can use a signed, legitimate DLL as the decoy\n3. **Memory Attribution**: Memory appears to belong to a legitimate module\n4. **No New Process**: Stays within existing process boundaries\n5. **Minimal Suspicious Calls**: Fewer API calls than traditional injection\n\n### Detection Challenges:\n\n- **Static Analysis**: Memory still shows legitimate DLL name/path\n- **EDR Evasion**: Bypasses hooks on `CreateRemoteThread` if using direct execution\n- **Memory Scanning**: Initial scan shows legitimate DLL signature\n- **Call Stack**: Can appear to originate from legitimate module\n\n## Modern Defenses (2024)\n\nSecurity tools now employ:\n\n1. **Memory Integrity Checks**: Validate loaded modules against disk versions\n2. **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor `LoadLibraryEx` with suspicious flags\n3. **Execute-from-Write Detection**: Flag memory regions that are both writable and executable\n4. **Behavioral Analysis**: Track unusual API call sequences\n5. **Code Signing Validation**: Verify code in memory matches signed version\n6. **CFG/CIG**: Control Flow Guard and Code Integrity Guard on Windows 10/11\n\n## Variants in 2024\n\n1. **Module Stomping**: Similar technique using already-loaded modules\n2. **Phantom DLL Hollowing**: Load with `LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE_RESOURCE`\n3. **Transacted Hollowing**: Combine with NTFS transactions\n4. **DLL Unhooking**: Strip EDR hooks before injection\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```\n1.

Previously in SQLAlchemy 1.x, you could pass raw SQL strings directly to `session.execute()` or `connection.execute()`:\n\n```python\n# This worked in SQLAlchemy 1.x but fails in 2.x\nresult = session.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1\")\n```\n\nIn SQLAlchemy 2.x, this raises an `ObjectNotExecutableError` because raw strings are no longer considered executable objects for security and explicitness reasons.\n\n## The Fix: Using text()\n\nThe solution is to wrap your raw SQL strings with the `text()` construct:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\n# Correct way in SQLAlchemy 2.x\nresult = session.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1\"))\n```\n\n## Parameter Binding with text()\n\nFor parameterized queries, use named parameters with `text()`:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\n# Using bound parameters (safer against SQL injection)\nresult = session.execute(\n    text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id\"),\n    {\"user_id\": 1}\n)\n\n# Or multiple parameters\nresult = session.execute(\n    text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = :name AND age > :age\"),\n    {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}\n)\n```\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n**1. Simple SELECT query:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nrows = session.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\")).fetchall()\n```\n\n**2.

Use SecureStore for that.\n- **Key-value format**: All keys and values must be strings\n- **JSON required**: Use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` for objects\n- **Cross-platform**: Works on Android, iOS, macOS, tvOS, and Web\n- **Included in Expo Go**: Available immediately in development builds\n\n## Sources\n\n- [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/async-storage/)\n- [How to Store Data Locally in React Native Expo - freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-store-data-locally-in-react-native-expo/)\n- [AsyncStorage - Expo Documentation v52](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v52.0.0/sdk/async-storage/)\n- [Expo SDK 54 - Expo Changelog](https://expo.dev/changelog/sdk-54)","timestamp":41192}],"metadata":{"category":"Documentation","subcategory":"Expo","lang":"React","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769686360502,"end":1769686401694,"firstResponse":41192,"sessionCreation":0,"total":41192},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1761","input":"How to use the graphiti ExtractedEntities response_model in 2026","output":"Based on my research, here's how to use the graphiti `ExtractedEntities` response_model in 2026:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` is a Pydantic response model used in Graphiti for entity extraction validation. It structures the output from LLMs when extracting entities from unstructured data to build knowledge graphs.\n\n## Expected Schema\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` model expects this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extracted_entities\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Entity Name\",\n      \"entity_type_id\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Key Fields:\n- **`extracted_entities`**: Array of extracted entity objects\n- **`name`**: Name of the extracted entity (string, required)\n- **`entity_type_id`**: ID of the classified entity type (required)\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n### LLM Provider Compatibility\nGraphiti works best with LLM services that support **Structured Output**, such as:\n- OpenAI (GPT-4+)\n- Google Gemini\n\nUsing other LLM providers may result in validation errors because they might not properly support the `response_format` parameter, leading to incorrect output schemas.\n\n### Common Validation Error\n\nYou may encounter this error with incompatible providers:\n\n```\n1 validation error for ExtractedEntities\nextracted_entities\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={'entities': [...]}, input_type=dict]\n```\n\nThis occurs when the LLM returns a different schema (e.g., `entities` instead of `extracted_entities`, or `entity_name` instead of `name`).\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use supported LLM providers** (OpenAI, Gemini) for reliable structured output\n2. **Define custom entity types** using Pydantic models to represent domain-specific knowledge\n3. **Validate your entity extraction** before ingestion to catch schema mismatches early\n4.

It structures the output from LLMs when extracting entities from unstructured data to build knowledge graphs.\n\n## Expected Schema\n\nThe `ExtractedEntities` model expects this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extracted_entities\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Entity Name\",\n      \"entity_type_id\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Key Fields:\n- **`extracted_entities`**: Array of extracted entity objects\n- **`name`**: Name of the extracted entity (string, required)\n- **`entity_type_id`**: ID of the classified entity type (required)\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n### LLM Provider Compatibility\nGraphiti works best with LLM services that support **Structured Output**, such as:\n- OpenAI (GPT-4+)\n- Google Gemini\n\nUsing other LLM providers may result in validation errors because they might not properly support the `response_format` parameter, leading to incorrect output schemas.\n\n### Common Validation Error\n\nYou may encounter this error with incompatible providers:\n\n```\n1 validation error for ExtractedEntities\nextracted_entities\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={'entities': [...]}, input_type=dict]\n```\n\nThis occurs when the LLM returns a different schema (e.g., `entities` instead of `extracted_entities`, or `entity_name` instead of `name`).\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use supported LLM providers** (OpenAI, Gemini) for reliable structured output\n2. **Define custom entity types** using Pydantic models to represent domain-specific knowledge\n3. **Validate your entity extraction** before ingestion to catch schema mismatches early\n4.

{"id":"websearch-1806","input":"How do I use the rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through the relay API in 2026?","output":"Based on the current rust-libp2p documentation and examples, here's how to use the relay client behaviour to dial through a relay in 2026:\n\n## Setting Up the Relay Client\n\n### 1. Create Transport and Behaviour\n\nYou have two main approaches:\n\n**Modern SwarmBuilder Approach** (Recommended):\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{SwarmBuilder, noise, yamux};\n\nlet swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_new_identity()\n    .with_relay_client(noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)?\n    .build();\n```\n\n**Manual Setup**:\n```rust\nuse libp2p::relay::client;\nuse libp2p::core::transport::OrTransport;\n\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = client::Client::new_transport_and_behaviour(\n    local_peer_id\n);\n\n// Combine with your actual transport\nlet transport = OrTransport::new(relay_transport, actual_transport)\n    .upgrade(/* ... */);\n```\n\n## Dialing Through a Relay\n\n### 2. Construct the Relay Multiaddr\n\nThe key is building a multiaddr with this structure:\n- Relay's address (e.g., `/ip4/x.x.x.x/tcp/4001`)\n- Relay's peer ID (`/p2p/<relay-peer-id>`)\n- Circuit protocol marker (`/p2p-circuit`)\n- Destination peer ID (`/p2p/<destination-peer-id>`)\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{Multiaddr, multiaddr::Protocol};\n\nlet relay_address = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001\"\n    .parse::<Multiaddr>()?\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_peer_id))\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_peer_id));\n\n// Dial through the relay\nswarm.dial(relay_address)?;\n```\n\n### 3. Listen for Events\n\nMonitor relay-specific events:\n```rust\nloop {\n    match swarm.select_next_some().await {\n        SwarmEvent::Behaviour(relay::client::Event::ReservationReqAccepted { .. }) => {\n            println!(\"Relay accepted our reservation request\");\n        }\n        SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished { peer_id, .. } => {\n            println!(\"Connected to {} via relay\", peer_id);\n        }\n        // Handle other events...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Example Address Format\n\n```\n/ip4/192.168.1.1/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWRelay.../p2p-circuit/p2p/12D3KooWDest...\n```\n\nThis tells libp2p to:\n1. Connect to the relay at `192.168.1.1:4001`\n2. Use relay peer ID `12D3KooWRelay...`\n3. Request a circuit relay connection\n4.

Create Transport and Behaviour\n\nYou have two main approaches:\n\n**Modern SwarmBuilder Approach** (Recommended):\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{SwarmBuilder, noise, yamux};\n\nlet swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_new_identity()\n    .with_relay_client(noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)?\n    .build();\n```\n\n**Manual Setup**:\n```rust\nuse libp2p::relay::client;\nuse libp2p::core::transport::OrTransport;\n\nlet (relay_transport, relay_behaviour) = client::Client::new_transport_and_behaviour(\n    local_peer_id\n);\n\n// Combine with your actual transport\nlet transport = OrTransport::new(relay_transport, actual_transport)\n    .upgrade(/* ... */);\n```\n\n## Dialing Through a Relay\n\n### 2. Construct the Relay Multiaddr\n\nThe key is building a multiaddr with this structure:\n- Relay's address (e.g., `/ip4/x.x.x.x/tcp/4001`)\n- Relay's peer ID (`/p2p/<relay-peer-id>`)\n- Circuit protocol marker (`/p2p-circuit`)\n- Destination peer ID (`/p2p/<destination-peer-id>`)\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{Multiaddr, multiaddr::Protocol};\n\nlet relay_address = \"/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001\"\n    .parse::<Multiaddr>()?\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(relay_peer_id))\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_peer_id));\n\n// Dial through the relay\nswarm.dial(relay_address)?;\n```\n\n### 3. Listen for Events\n\nMonitor relay-specific events:\n```rust\nloop {\n    match swarm.select_next_some().await {\n        SwarmEvent::Behaviour(relay::client::Event::ReservationReqAccepted { .. }) => {\n            println!(\"Relay accepted our reservation request\");\n        }\n        SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished { peer_id, .. } => {\n            println!(\"Connected to {} via relay\", peer_id);\n        }\n        // Handle other events...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Example Address Format\n\n```\n/ip4/192.168.1.1/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWRelay.../p2p-circuit/p2p/12D3KooWDest...\n```\n\nThis tells libp2p to:\n1. Connect to the relay at `192.168.1.1:4001`\n2. Use relay peer ID `12D3KooWRelay...`\n3. Request a circuit relay connection\n4. To destination peer `12D3KooWDest...`\n\n## Notes\n\n- The relay client will automatically handle reservation requests with the relay\n- You can listen on multiple relays for improved availability\n- For production use, consider implementing AutoRelay patterns for automatic relay discovery and management\n\nSources:\n- [libp2p::relay - Rust](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/index.html)\n- [libp2p::relay::client - Rust](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/index.html)\n- [A question on circuit relay · libp2p/rust-libp2p · Discussion #2944](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions/2944)\n- [Trial towards a chat application with a relay server · libp2p/rust-libp2p · Discussion #2693](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions/2693)\n- [ClientTransport in libp2p::relay::v2::client::transport - Rust](https://rustdocs.bsx.fi/libp2p/relay/v2/client/transport/struct.ClientTransport.html)\n- [libp2p_relay::new_transport_and_behaviour - Rust](https://docs.rs/libp2p-relay/0.2.0/libp2p_relay/fn.new_transport_and_behaviour.html)","timestamp":92821}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Libp2p_Rust","lang":"Rust","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769687064718,"end":1769687157539,"firstResponse":92821,"sessionCreation":0,"total":92821},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1846","input":"How do I use Google Cloud TTS v1beta1 enable_time_pointing with TimepointType.SSML_MARK in 2026?","output":"Based on my research, here's how to use Google Cloud TTS v1beta1's `enable_time_pointing` with `TimepointType.SSML_MARK` in 2026:\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe `enable_time_pointing` parameter allows you to get timing information for `<mark>` tags in your SSML input. When set to `SSML_MARK`, the API returns timepoints that map specific locations in your input text to corresponding times in the output audio.\n\n## Implementation\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import texttospeech_v1beta1 as texttospeech\n\nclient = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()\n\nrequest = texttospeech.SynthesizeSpeechRequest(\n    input=texttospeech.SynthesisInput(\n        ssml='<speak>Hello <mark name=\"mark1\"/> world <mark name=\"mark2\"/> today</speak>'\n    ),\n    voice=texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(\n        language_code='en-US',\n        name='en-US-Neural2-A'\n    ),\n    audio_config=texttospeech.AudioConfig(\n        audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3\n    ),\n    enable_time_pointing=[texttospeech.SynthesizeSpeechRequest.TimepointType.SSML_MARK]\n)\n\nresponse = client.synthesize_speech(request=request)\n\n# Access timing information\nfor timepoint in response.timepoints:\n    print(f\"Mark: {timepoint.mark_name}, Time: {timepoint.time_seconds}s\")\n```\n\n**Node.js Example:**\n```javascript\nconst textToSpeech = require('@google-cloud/text-to-speech');\nconst client = new textToSpeech.TextToSpeechClient();\n\nconst request = {\n  input: {ssml: '<speak>Hello <mark name=\"mark1\"/> world <mark name=\"mark2\"/> today</speak>'},\n  voice: {languageCode: 'en-US', name: 'en-US-Neural2-A'},\n  audioConfig: {audioEncoding: 'MP3'},\n  enableTimePointing: ['SSML_MARK']\n};\n\nconst [response] = await client.synthesizeSpeech(request);\n\n// Access timing information\nresponse.timepoints.forEach(timepoint => {\n  console.log(`Mark: ${timepoint.markName}, Time: ${timepoint.timeSeconds}s`);\n});\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Avoid consecutive marks**: Don't place multiple `<mark>` tags without audio content between them, as this may prevent events from being generated\n2. **Use START/END marks**: Instead of placing marks at the very beginning or end of SSML, use the implicit START and END marks\n3. **Name your marks**: Give each mark a unique, descriptive name attribute for easy identification\n\n## Known Issues\n\nThere was a bug reported in 2023 where timepoints were only returned until the first period in the text. Check the Google Developer forums if you encounter similar issues.\n\n## Sources:\n- [SSML mark timepointing discussion - Google Developer forums](https://discuss.google.dev/t/ssml-mark-timepointing-v1beta1-suddenly-only-returns-the-timepoints-until-first-period/104868)\n- [v1beta1 API proto definition - GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/texttospeech/v1beta1/cloud_tts.proto)\n- [SSML Documentation - Google Cloud](https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml)\n- [v1beta1 API Reference - Google Cloud](https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.texttospeech.v1beta1)\n- [SSML Tutorial - Google Cloud](https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml-tutorial)\n- [TTS Basics - Google Cloud](https://docs.cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/basics)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about Google Cloud TTS v1beta1's `enable_time_pointing` feature with `TimepointType.SSML_MARK` in 2026.","timestamp":65471},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":65471},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0116jt9LQtoPRbDDHRMFUnu9","status":"completed","timestamp":65471},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more specific documentation about the implementation details:","timestamp":65471},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":65471},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_015AaQ86Je4bLYyPAYCbvp9K","status":"completed","timestamp":65471},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":65471},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GasWhb5tntYxjFfTWW3ELv","status":"completed","timestamp":65471},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's how to use Google Cloud TTS v1beta1's `enable_time_pointing` with `TimepointType.SSML_MARK` in 2026:\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe `enable_time_pointing` parameter allows you to get timing information for `<mark>` tags in your SSML input.
