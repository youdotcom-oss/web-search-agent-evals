{"id":"websearch-49","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to deploy a gpt model to azure ai foundry using pulumi in 2026\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to deploy a GPT model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Deploying GPT Models to Azure AI Foundry with Pulumi (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nAzure AI Foundry (formerly Azure OpenAI Service) is Microsoft's platform for deploying and managing AI models including GPT-4.1, GPT-5, GPT-5.2, and GPT-5.2-Codex. You can use Pulumi's **azure-native** or **azure** provider to provision these resources as Infrastructure as Code.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Azure Subscription** with Azure OpenAI/AI Services access approved\n2. **Pulumi CLI** installed and configured\n3. **Azure credentials** configured (via `az login` or service principal)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Cognitive Services Account (OpenAI/AIServices)\n\nFirst, create a Cognitive Services Account with `kind` set to `\"OpenAI\"` or `\"AIServices\"`:\n\n#### TypeScript Example\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// Create resource group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg-openai\", {\n    resourceGroupName: \"rg-openai-foundry\",\n    location: \"eastus\",\n});\n\n// Create Azure OpenAI / Cognitive Services Account\nconst cognitiveAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    accountName: \"my-openai-account\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",  // or \"AIServices\" for broader AI capabilities\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\",\n    },\n    properties: {\n        customSubDomainName: \"my-openai-subdomain\",\n        publicNetworkAccess: \"Enabled\",\n    },\n});\n```\n\n#### Python Example\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport pulumi_azure_native as azure_native\n\n# Create resource group\nresource_group = azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg-openai\",\n    resource_group_name=\"rg-openai-foundry\",\n    location=\"eastus\")\n\n# Create Azure OpenAI Account\ncognitive_account = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\",\n    account_name=\"my-openai-account\",\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    location=resource_group.location,\n    kind=\"OpenAI\",\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"S0\",\n    ),\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.AccountPropertiesArgs(\n        custom_sub_domain_name=\"my-openai-subdomain\",\n        public_network_access=\"Enabled\",\n    ))\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Deploy a GPT Model\n\nUse `azure-native.cognitiveservices.Deployment` to deploy GPT models:\n\n#### TypeScript Example (GPT-4.1 or GPT-5)\n```typescript\n// Deploy GPT model\nconst gptDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    accountName: cognitiveAccount.name,\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-5-deployment\",\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-5\",           // Model name: gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-5, gpt-5.2, gpt-5.2-codex\n            version: \"2025-08-07\",   // Model version\n        },\n        versionUpgradeOption: \"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    },\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10,  // Tokens-per-minute (in thousands)\n    },\n});\n\n// Export endpoint\nexport const endpoint = cognitiveAccount.properties.apply(p => p?.endpoint);\n```\n\n#### Python Example\n```python\n# Deploy GPT model\ngpt_deployment = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\",\n    account_name=cognitive_account.name,\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    deployment_name=\"gpt-5-deployment\",\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentPropertiesArgs(\n        model=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentModelArgs(\n            format=\"OpenAI\",\n            name=\"gpt-5\",\n            version=\"2025-08-07\",\n        ),\n        version_upgrade_option=\"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    ),\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"Standard\",\n        capacity=10,\n    ))\n\n# Export endpoint\npulumi.export(\"endpoint\", cognitive_account.properties.endpoint)\n```\n\n#### YAML Example\n```yaml\nname: azure-openai-deployment\nruntime: yaml\nresources:\n  resourceGroup:\n    type: azure-native:resources:ResourceGroup\n    properties:\n      resourceGroupName: rg-openai-foundry\n      location: eastus\n  \n  cognitiveAccount:\n

on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to deploy a GPT model to Azure AI Foundry using Pulumi in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Deploying GPT Models to Azure AI Foundry with Pulumi (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nAzure AI Foundry (formerly Azure OpenAI Service) is Microsoft's platform for deploying and managing AI models including GPT-4.1, GPT-5, GPT-5.2, and GPT-5.2-Codex. You can use Pulumi's **azure-native** or **azure** provider to provision these resources as Infrastructure as Code.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Azure Subscription** with Azure OpenAI/AI Services access approved\n2. **Pulumi CLI** installed and configured\n3. **Azure credentials** configured (via `az login` or service principal)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a Cognitive Services Account (OpenAI/AIServices)\n\nFirst, create a Cognitive Services Account with `kind` set to `\"OpenAI\"` or `\"AIServices\"`:\n\n#### TypeScript Example\n```typescript\nimport * as pulumi from \"@pulumi/pulumi\";\nimport * as azure_native from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\n// Create resource group\nconst resourceGroup = new azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg-openai\", {\n    resourceGroupName: \"rg-openai-foundry\",\n    location: \"eastus\",\n});\n\n// Create Azure OpenAI / Cognitive Services Account\nconst cognitiveAccount = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\", {\n    accountName: \"my-openai-account\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    location: resourceGroup.location,\n    kind: \"OpenAI\",  // or \"AIServices\" for broader AI capabilities\n    sku: {\n        name: \"S0\",\n    },\n    properties: {\n        customSubDomainName: \"my-openai-subdomain\",\n        publicNetworkAccess: \"Enabled\",\n    },\n});\n```\n\n#### Python Example\n```python\nimport pulumi\nimport pulumi_azure_native as azure_native\n\n# Create resource group\nresource_group = azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup(\"rg-openai\",\n    resource_group_name=\"rg-openai-foundry\",\n    location=\"eastus\")\n\n# Create Azure OpenAI Account\ncognitive_account = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Account(\"openai-account\",\n    account_name=\"my-openai-account\",\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    location=resource_group.location,\n    kind=\"OpenAI\",\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"S0\",\n    ),\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.AccountPropertiesArgs(\n        custom_sub_domain_name=\"my-openai-subdomain\",\n        public_network_access=\"Enabled\",\n    ))\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Deploy a GPT Model\n\nUse `azure-native.cognitiveservices.Deployment` to deploy GPT models:\n\n#### TypeScript Example (GPT-4.1 or GPT-5)\n```typescript\n// Deploy GPT model\nconst gptDeployment = new azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    accountName: cognitiveAccount.name,\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-5-deployment\",\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-5\",           // Model name: gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-5, gpt-5.2, gpt-5.2-codex\n            version: \"2025-08-07\",   // Model version\n        },\n        versionUpgradeOption: \"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    },\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 10,  // Tokens-per-minute (in thousands)\n    },\n});\n\n// Export endpoint\nexport const endpoint = cognitiveAccount.properties.apply(p => p?.endpoint);\n```\n\n#### Python Example\n```python\n# Deploy GPT model\ngpt_deployment = azure_native.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\",\n    account_name=cognitive_account.name,\n    resource_group_name=resource_group.name,\n    deployment_name=\"gpt-5-deployment\",\n    properties=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentPropertiesArgs(\n        model=azure_native.cognitiveservices.DeploymentModelArgs(\n            format=\"OpenAI\",\n            name=\"gpt-5\",\n            version=\"2025-08-07\",\n        ),\n        version_upgrade_option=\"OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable\",\n    ),\n    sku=azure_native.cognitiveservices.SkuArgs(\n        name=\"Standard\",\n        capacity=10,\n    ))\n\n# Export endpoint\npulumi.export(\"endpoint\", cognitive_account.properties.endpoint)\n```\n\n#### YAML Example\n```yaml\nname: azure-openai-deployment\nruntime: yaml\nresources:\n  resourceGroup:\n    type: azure-native:resources:ResourceGroup\n    properties:\n      resourceGroupName: rg-openai-foundry\n      location: eastus\n  \n  cognitiveAccount:\n    type: azure-native:cognitiveservices:Account\n    properties:\n      accountName: my-openai-account\n      resourceGroupName: ${resourceGroup.name}\n      location: ${resourceGroup.location}\n

The legacy library is now deprecated and will no longer receive updates. Google recommends migrating to the new SDK for access to the latest features (Gemini 2.0+, Imagen, Veo, etc.) and continued support.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Installation\n\n**Before (Legacy):**\n```bash\nnpm install @google/generative-ai\n```\n\n**After (New):**\n```bash\nnpm install @google/genai\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Client Initialization & Authentication\n\n**Before (Legacy):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenerativeAI } from \"@google/generative-ai\";\nimport { GoogleAIFileManager, GoogleAICacheManager } from \"@google/generative-ai/server\";\n\nconst genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst cacheManager = new GoogleAICacheManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\n\n// Get a model instance, then call methods on it\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\n```\n\n**After (New):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenAI } from \"@google/genai\";\n\n// Create a single centralized client object\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: \"YOUR_API_KEY\" });\n\n// Access ALL services through this single client\n// ai.models, ai.chats, ai.files, ai.caches, etc.\n```\n\n**Key Change:** The new SDK uses a single `GoogleGenAI` client object that provides access to all services (models, chats, files, caches, tuning) instead of separate managers.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Generating Content (Text)\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\nconst result = await model.generateContent(\"Tell me a story\");\nconsole.log(result.response.text());\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Tell me a story\",\n});\nconsole.log(response.text);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4.

File Uploads\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleAIFileManager } from \"@google/generative-ai/server\";\nconst fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst uploadResult = await fileManager.uploadFile(\"path/to/file.pdf\", {\n  mimeType: \"application/pdf\",\n});\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst uploadedFile = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: \"path/to/file.pdf\",\n  config: { mimeType: \"application/pdf\" },\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 9. Images in Content\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nfunction fileToGenerativePart(path, mimeType) {\n  return {\n    inlineData: {\n      data: Buffer.from(fs.readFileSync(path)).toString(\"base64\"),\n      mimeType,\n    },\n  };\n}\nconst imagePart = fileToGenerativePart(\"image.jpg\", \"image/jpeg\");\nconst result = await model.generateContent([\"Describe this image\", imagePart]);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nimport { createUserContent, createPartFromUri } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nconst uploadedImage = await ai.files.upload({ file: \"image.jpg\" });\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: [\n    createUserContent([\n      \"Describe this image\",\n      createPartFromUri(uploadedImage.uri, uploadedImage.mimeType),\n    ]),\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 10. Caching\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleAICacheManager } from \"@google/generative-ai/server\";\nconst cacheManager = new GoogleAICacheManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst cache = await cacheManager.create({ model: \"...\", contents: [...] });\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModelFromCachedContent(cache);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst cache = await ai.caches.create({\n  model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n  config: {\n    contents: [...],\n    systemInstruction: \"You are an expert...\",\n  },\n});\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n  contents: \"Your prompt\",\n  config: { cachedContent: cache.name },\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 11. Counting Tokens\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\nconst countResult = await model.countTokens(\"Your text\");\nconsole.log(countResult.totalTokens);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst countResult = await ai.models.countTokens({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Your text\",\n});\nconsole.log(countResult.totalTokens);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 12. Embeddings\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-embedding-001\" });\nconst result = await model.embedContent(\"Hello world!\");\nconsole.log(result.embedding);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst result = await ai.models.embedContent({\n  model: \"gemini-embedding-001\",\n  contents: \"Hello world!\",\n  config: { outputDimensionality: 10 }, // optional\n});\nconsole.log(result.embeddings);\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Differences\n\n| Feature | Legacy (`@google/generative-ai`) | New (`@google/genai`) |\n|---------|----------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Import | `GoogleGenerativeAI` | `GoogleGenAI` |\n| Client | Multiple managers | Single unified client |\n| Model access | `genAI.getGenerativeModel()` | `ai.models.generateContent()` |\n| Chat | `model.startChat()` | `ai.chats.create()` |\n| Files | `GoogleAIFileManager` | `ai.files` |\n| Caching | `GoogleAICacheManager` | `ai.caches` |\n| Config | At model init | In request `config` object |\n| Response text | `result.response.text()` | `response.text` |\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- **Official Migration Guide:** https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate\n- **New SDK Documentation:** https://googleapis.github.io/js-genai/\n- **npm Package:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai\n- **Code Generation Instructions:** When using AI to generate code, Google recommends using their [codegen_instructions.md](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai) to guide models toward the new SDK patterns.","hint":"A correct answer must explain that @google/generative-ai is deprecated in favor of @google/genai and describe the essential migration steps: updating the npm package name/imports, switching from the old `GoogleGenerativeAI` client patterns to the new `GoogleAI`/`@google/genai` client and model usage patterns as documented in Google’s official “Migrate to the Google GenAI SDK / Gemini API” docs, and noting any key API surface changes (e.g., how models, file handling, or chat are now accessed).[[1, 2]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to migrate from @google/generative-ai to the @google/genai npm package API documentation 2026","timestamp":43193},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":43193},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HmGNbuGiottLX37uZcf8ke","status":"completed","timestamp":43193},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me get the detailed migration documentation from Google's official migration guide:","timestamp":43193},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":43193},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VY6grAn92HQwb3W62dt55d","status":"completed","timestamp":43193},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here is a comprehensive guide on how to migrate from `@google/generative-ai` to `@google/genai`:\n\n---\n\n## Migration Guide: `@google/generative-ai` → `@google/genai`\n\n### Background\nGoogle has released a new unified SDK called `@google/genai` (currently at v1.40.0) to replace the legacy `@google/generative-ai` package.

Client Initialization & Authentication\n\n**Before (Legacy):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenerativeAI } from \"@google/generative-ai\";\nimport { GoogleAIFileManager, GoogleAICacheManager } from \"@google/generative-ai/server\";\n\nconst genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst cacheManager = new GoogleAICacheManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\n\n// Get a model instance, then call methods on it\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\n```\n\n**After (New):**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleGenAI } from \"@google/genai\";\n\n// Create a single centralized client object\nconst ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: \"YOUR_API_KEY\" });\n\n// Access ALL services through this single client\n// ai.models, ai.chats, ai.files, ai.caches, etc.\n```\n\n**Key Change:** The new SDK uses a single `GoogleGenAI` client object that provides access to all services (models, chats, files, caches, tuning) instead of separate managers.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Generating Content (Text)\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\nconst result = await model.generateContent(\"Tell me a story\");\nconsole.log(result.response.text());\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Tell me a story\",\n});\nconsole.log(response.text);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Streaming Content\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst result = await model.generateContentStream(\"Write a story\");\nfor await (const chunk of result.stream) {\n  process.stdout.write(chunk.text());\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Write a story\",\n});\nfor await (const chunk of response) {\n  console.log(chunk.text);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Configuration Options\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({\n  model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n  generationConfig: {\n    candidateCount: 1,\n    stopSequences: [\"x\"],\n    maxOutputTokens: 20,\n    temperature: 1.0,\n  },\n});\nconst result = await model.generateContent(\"Tell me a story\");\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Tell me a story\",\n  config: {\n    candidateCount: 1,\n    stopSequences: [\"x\"],\n    maxOutputTokens: 20,\n    temperature: 1.0,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Key Change:** Configuration is now passed in a `config` object within the request, not at model initialization.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Chat Sessions\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\nconst chat = model.startChat({\n  history: [\n    { role: \"user\", parts: [{ text: \"Hello\" }] },\n    { role: \"model\", parts: [{ text: \"Hi there!\" }] },\n  ],\n});\nconst result = await chat.sendMessage(\"How are you?\");\nconsole.log(result.response.text());\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst chat = ai.chats.create({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  history: [\n    { role: \"user\", parts: [{ text: \"Hello\" }] },\n    { role: \"model\", parts: [{ text: \"Hi there!\" }] },\n  ],\n});\nconst response = await chat.sendMessage({ message: \"How are you?\" });\nconsole.log(response.text);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. Safety Settings\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nimport { HarmCategory, HarmBlockThreshold } from \"@google/generative-ai\";\n\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({\n  model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n  safetySettings: [\n    {\n      category: HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT,\n      threshold: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Your prompt\",\n  config: {\n    safetySettings: [\n      {\n        category: \"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT\",\n        threshold: \"BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH\",\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. File Uploads\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleAIFileManager } from \"@google/generative-ai/server\";\nconst fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst uploadResult = await fileManager.uploadFile(\"path/to/file.pdf\", {\n  mimeType: \"application/pdf\",\n});\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst uploadedFile = await ai.files.upload({\n  file: \"path/to/file.pdf\",\n  config: { mimeType: \"application/pdf\" },\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 9. Images in Content\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nfunction fileToGenerativePart(path, mimeType) {\n  return {\n    inlineData: {\n      data: Buffer.from(fs.readFileSync(path)).toString(\"base64\"),\n      mimeType,\n    },\n  };\n}\nconst imagePart = fileToGenerativePart(\"image.jpg\", \"image/jpeg\");\nconst result = await model.generateContent([\"Describe this image\", imagePart]);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nimport { createUserContent, createPartFromUri } from \"@google/genai\";\n\nconst uploadedImage = await ai.files.upload({ file: \"image.jpg\" });\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: [\n    createUserContent([\n      \"Describe this image\",\n      createPartFromUri(uploadedImage.uri, uploadedImage.mimeType),\n    ]),\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 10. Caching\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nimport { GoogleAICacheManager } from \"@google/generative-ai/server\";\nconst cacheManager = new GoogleAICacheManager(\"YOUR_API_KEY\");\nconst cache = await cacheManager.create({ model: \"...\", contents: [...] });\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModelFromCachedContent(cache);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst cache = await ai.caches.create({\n  model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n  config: {\n    contents: [...],\n    systemInstruction: \"You are an expert...\",\n  },\n});\nconst response = await ai.models.generateContent({\n  model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n  contents: \"Your prompt\",\n  config: { cachedContent: cache.name },\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 11. Counting Tokens\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-1.5-flash\" });\nconst countResult = await model.countTokens(\"Your text\");\nconsole.log(countResult.totalTokens);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst countResult = await ai.models.countTokens({\n  model: \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n  contents: \"Your text\",\n});\nconsole.log(countResult.totalTokens);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 12. Embeddings\n\n**Before:**\n```javascript\nconst model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: \"gemini-embedding-001\" });\nconst result = await model.embedContent(\"Hello world!\");\nconsole.log(result.embedding);\n```\n\n**After:**\n```javascript\nconst result = await ai.models.embedContent({\n  model: \"gemini-embedding-001\",\n  contents: \"Hello world!\",\n  config: { outputDimensionality: 10 }, // optional\n});\nconsole.log(result.embeddings);\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Differences\n\n| Feature | Legacy (`@google/generative-ai`) | New (`@google/genai`) |\n|---------|----------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Import | `GoogleGenerativeAI` | `GoogleGenAI` |\n| Client | Multiple managers | Single unified client |\n| Model access | `genAI.getGenerativeModel()` | `ai.models.generateContent()` |\n| Chat | `model.startChat()` | `ai.chats.create()` |\n| Files | `GoogleAIFileManager` | `ai.files` |\n| Caching | `GoogleAICacheManager` | `ai.caches` |\n| Config | At model init | In request `config` object |\n| Response text | `result.response.text()` | `response.text` |\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- **Official Migration Guide:** https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate\n- **New SDK Documentation:** https://googleapis.github.io/js-genai/\n- **npm Package:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai\n- **Code Generation Instructions:** When using AI to generate code, Google recommends using their [codegen_instructions.md](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai) to guide models toward the new SDK patterns.","timestamp":43193}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Google_GenAI","lang":"TypeScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770544697126,"end":1770544740319,"firstResponse":43193,"sessionCreation":0,"total":43193},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Clean Reinstall (Most Common Fix)**\nThe most effective solution is to perform a clean reinstall:\n\n```bash\n# Remove existing droid installation\nrm -rf ~/.factory\n\n# On macOS, also remove:\nrm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factory\n\n# On Linux, also remove:\nrm -rf ~/.config/factory\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/factory\n\n# Reinstall droid\ncurl -fsSL https://app.factory.ai/cli | sh\n```\n\n### **2. Check System Requirements**\n- **Linux users**: Ensure `xdg-utils` is installed: `sudo apt-get install xdg-utils`\n- **Older CPUs**: If you have a pre-2013 x64 CPU without AVX2 support, ensure you're using the correct build\n\n### **3. Authentication Issues**\nIf the update fails with authentication errors:\n1. Run `droid logout` then `droid login`\n2. Or delete the auth cache: `rm -rf ~/.factory/auth*`\n3. Generate a new API key at [app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys)\n\n### **4. Settings File Corruption**\nIf `settings.json` became corrupted:\n1. Backup your custom configurations\n2. Delete the settings file: `rm ~/.factory/settings.json`\n3. Restart droid - it will regenerate defaults\n\n### **5. Windows-Specific Fixes**\n- Use the deferred update strategy (updates apply on next startup)\n- Check for file permission errors (EPERM)\n- Try running as administrator if file operations fail\n\n### **6.

This means when you publish ports with `-p`, external traffic can reach your containers even with `ufw deny incoming` active.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions\n\n### **Solution 1: Use `ufw-docker` Tool (Recommended)**\n\nThis is the most practical and well-maintained approach:\n\n```bash\n# Download and install ufw-docker\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\n\n# Install the UFW rules (modifies /etc/ufw/after.rules)\nsudo ufw-docker install\n\n# Reload UFW\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\n**To allow traffic to a container:**\n```bash\n# Allow HTTP/HTTPS to specific container\nufw-docker allow nginx 80\nufw-docker allow nginx 443\n\n# Or using ufw route\nufw route allow proto tcp from any to 172.17.0.2 port 80\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Bind Ports to Localhost Only**\n\nPrevent external access by binding published ports to `127.0.0.1`:\n\n```bash\n# Instead of:\ndocker run -p 80:80 nginx\n\n# Use:\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 nginx\n```\n\nThen use a reverse proxy (like Traefik or Nginx on the host) to route external traffic.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Disable Docker's iptables (Manual)**\n\n```bash\n# Create/edit /etc/docker/daemon.json\necho '{\"iptables\": false}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json\n\n# Restart Docker\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n\n# Change UFW forward policy\nsudo sed -i 's/DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"DROP\"/DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"ACCEPT\"/g' /etc/default/ufw\nsudo ufw reload\n\n# Add NAT rule for Docker network\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING ! -o docker0 -s 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE\n```\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: This can break container networking, bridge networks, and outbound container access.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 4: Don't Publish Ports**\n\nFor internal container-to-container communication:\n\n```bash\n# Create internal network\ndocker network create internal-link\n\n# Run containers without -p\ndocker run --name server -d --network internal-link nginx\ndocker run --name client -d --network internal-link ubuntu\n```\n\nContainers on the same network can communicate without exposing ports externally.\n\n---\n\n## What `ufw-docker install` Adds to `/etc/ufw/after.rules`:\n\n```\n# BEGIN UFW AND DOCKER\n*filter\n:ufw-user-forward - [0:0]\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-forward\n\n# Allow internal Docker networks\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n\n# Allow DNS responses\n-A DOCKER-USER -p udp -m udp --sport 53 --dport 1024:65535 -j RETURN\n\n# Block external access to internal networks\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-docker-logging-deny -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -d 172.16.0.0/12\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN\nCOMMIT\n# END UFW AND DOCKER\n```\n\n---\n\n## Best Practice Recommendation\n\n1. **Use `ufw-docker`** for most setups - it's actively maintained and provides granular control\n2. **Bind to localhost** (`127.0.0.1:port:port`) for services behind a reverse proxy\n3.

{"id":"websearch-304","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix the lifi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error in solidity 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix the lifi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error in solidity 2026\nBased on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` custom error in LI.FI Solidity contracts and how to fix it.\n\n## How to Fix the LiFi `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` Custom Error in Solidity\n\n### What is this Error?\n\nThe `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` is a custom error defined in LI.FI's smart contracts (in `src/Errors/GenericErrors.sol`).

Here's the complete answer:\n\n---\n\n## How to Use Vercel AI SDK `streamText` for Multimodal Content and Image Support (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Vercel AI SDK provides powerful multimodal capabilities through the `streamText` function, allowing you to process images, generate images, and handle various content types with real-time streaming.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Sending Images to Vision Models (Image Input)**\n\nVision models like GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini can process both text and images using the multimodal message format:\n\n#### Server-Side (API Route)\n```typescript\nimport { streamText, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n  \n  const result = streamText({\n    model: 'openai/gpt-4.1', // or openai('gpt-4o')\n    messages: await convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n#### Client-Side (React with useChat)\n```typescript\n'use client';\nimport { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const [input, setInput] = useState('');\n  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState('');\n  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat();\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (event: React.FormEvent) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    sendMessage({\n      role: 'user',\n      parts: [\n        // Add image if URL is provided\n        ...(imageUrl.trim().length > 0\n          ? [{\n              type: 'file' as const,\n              mediaType: 'image/png',\n              url: imageUrl,\n            }]\n          : []),\n        { type: 'text' as const, text: input },\n      ],\n    });\n    setInput('');\n    setImageUrl('');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        value={imageUrl}\n        onChange={e => setImageUrl(e.target.value)}\n        placeholder=\"Image URL...\"\n      />\n      <input\n        value={input}\n        onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)}\n        placeholder=\"Ask about the image...\"\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Direct Image Analysis with Buffer\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nconst { textStream } = streamText({\n  model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: 'user',\n      content: [\n        { type: 'text', text: 'What do you see in this image?' },\n        { type: 'image', image: imageBuffer }, // Buffer or base64\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n});\n\nfor await (const chunk of textStream) {\n  process.stdout.write(chunk);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Image Generation with `streamText` (Multimodal LLMs)**\n\nSome models can generate images while streaming text. Images arrive as events in the stream.\n\n#### Google Gemini Image Models\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\n\nasync function main() {\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: 'google/gemini-3-pro-image', // or 'google/gemini-2.5-flash-image'\n    prompt: 'Generate an artistic image of a sunset over mountains',\n  });\n\n  // Stream text output as it arrives\n  for await (const delta of result.fullStream) {\n    if (delta.type === 'text-delta') {\n      process.stdout.write(delta.text);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Access generated images after streaming completes\n  const finalResult = await result;\n  console.log(`Generated ${finalResult.files.length} image(s)`);\n  \n  // Save images\n  for (const [index, file] of finalResult.files.entries()) {\n    if (file.mediaType?.startsWith('image/')) {\n      await fs.promises.writeFile(`image-${index}.png`, file.uint8Array);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### OpenAI Models with Image Generation Tool\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: 'openai/gpt-5.1-instant',\n  prompt: 'Generate an image of a golden retriever in a park',\n  tools: {\n    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({\n      outputFormat: 'webp',\n      quality: 'high',\n    }),\n  },\n});\n\n// Images arrive as tool-result events\nfor await (const part of result.fullStream) {\n  if (part.type === 'tool-result' && part.toolName === 'image_generation') {\n    const base64Image = part.output.result;\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(base64Image, 'base64');\n    await fs.promises.writeFile('generated-image.webp', buffer);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **PDF and Document Analysis**\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nconst { textStream } = streamText({\n  model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: 'user',\n      content: [\n        { type: 'text', text: 'Summarize this document' },\n        { type: 'file', data: pdfBuffer, mimeType: 'application/pdf' },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n});\n\nfor await (const chunk of textStream) {\n  process.stdout.write(chunk);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Multiple Images in a Single Request**\n```typescript\nimport { streamText, convertToCoreMessages } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nconst userMessage = {\n  role: 'user',\n  content: [\n    { type: 'text', text: 'Compare these two images' },\n    { type: 'image', image: new URL('https://example.com/image1.png') },\n    { type: 'image', image: new URL('https://example.com/image2.png') },\n  ],\n};\n\nconst result = await streamText({\n  model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n  messages: [...convertToCoreMessages(initialMessages), userMessage],\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **AI SDK 5/6 Typed Messages (2025-2026)**\n\nThe latest SDK versions introduce typed chat messages for better type safety:\n\n```typescript\n// UIMessage vs ModelMessage pattern\nimport { streamText, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';\n\n// Convert UI messages to model messages before streaming\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n  messages: await convertToModelMessages(uiMessages),\n});\n\nreturn result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points for 2026\n\n1. **Provider Abstraction**: Same code works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.\n2. **Parts Array**: Use the `parts` array in messages for multimodal content\n3. **Image Types**: Support for URLs, buffers, base64, and file uploads\n4. **Streaming Images**: Generated images come via `result.files` (Gemini) or `tool-result` events (OpenAI)\n5. **Type Safety**: Use `convertToModelMessages()` for proper UIMessage to ModelMessage conversion\n6. **toUIMessageStreamResponse()**: Preferred method for returning streamed responses in API routes","hint":"A good answer must explain how to call `streamText` from the Vercel AI SDK with a multimodal-capable model (e.g., GPT‑4o or Gemini) and messages that include image parts/URLs or attachments, and describe how image results are returned and consumed (e.g., via tool-result events or specific fields in the stream). It should also note any 2025–2026 API patterns or version details relevant to multimodal/image support (such as AI SDK v5/v6, AI Gateway image generation behavior, and handling base64 or tool-result image payloads) rather than only covering basic text streaming.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use Vercel AI SDK streamText for multimodal content and image support in 2026","timestamp":44075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":44075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01396Qtt59SYjwYZf9ABzRjT","status":"completed","timestamp":44075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":44075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BMFHBpkxmCY4ftiaEASjab","status":"completed","timestamp":44075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0183dgUuuRMVA9EGiVMAGMXE","status":"completed","timestamp":44075},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NjKugnPgGa8PK3TywM28Ne","status":"completed","timestamp":44075},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I now have comprehensive information about using Vercel AI SDK `streamText` for multimodal content and image support.

{"id":"websearch-614","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024\nBased on the search results, here's a comprehensive answer on **how to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on blog posts in Google Search Console**:\n\n## Why Embedded YouTube Videos Don't Get Indexed\n\nThe main reason is that Google distinguishes between **\"watch pages\"** and regular pages:\n\n- A **watch page** is a page where the video is the **primary content**\n- Blog posts with embedded videos are considered pages where the video is **supplementary content**\n- Google only indexes videos from dedicated watch pages\n\n## Solutions to Fix Video Indexing Issues\n\n### 1. **Create Dedicated Video Watch Pages**\n- Create a separate page where the video is the **main focus** (not just embedded in a blog post)\n- The page's primary purpose should be watching that single video\n- You can still embed the video in your blog post as supplementary content\n\n### 2. **Add VideoObject Schema Markup**\nAdd structured data to help Google understand your video:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Video description\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-15\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Ensure Video Has a Thumbnail URL**\n- Google requires a thumbnail URL to index videos\n- YouTube embeds usually provide this automatically, but verify with schema markup\n\n### 4. **Fix \"Video Outside the Viewport\" Issues**\n- Make sure the video is visible above the fold or in a prominent position\n- Don't hide videos behind tabs, accordions, or requiring user interaction to load\n- Ensure the video iframe is properly sized and visible on page load\n\n### 5. **Check Page Indexing First**\n- The page itself must be indexed before the video can be indexed\n- Use URL Inspection tool in Search Console to verify page is indexed\n- Ensure the page is the **canonical version** (non-canonical pages won't have videos indexed)\n\n### 6. **Avoid JavaScript-Only Video Loading**\n- If your video requires JavaScript to load, Googlebot may not detect it\n- Ensure the video embed code is present in the initial HTML\n\n## Important Reality Check\n\n**For embedded YouTube videos on blog posts, Google typically won't index them as part of your site** because:\n\n1.

The video already exists on YouTube and is indexed there\n2. Your blog post isn't a \"watch page\" — it's content with a supplementary video\n3. Google avoids \"double indexing\" the same YouTube video\n\n### What You Should Do Instead:\n\n1. **Focus on YouTube SEO** — Optimize your YouTube video titles, descriptions, and tags\n2. **Link to your blog** in the YouTube video description\n3. **Create dedicated video pages** only if having the video indexed on your domain is critical for business\n4. **Use structured data** for better rich snippets, even if the video itself isn't indexed\n\n## Quick Checklist\n\n| Issue | Fix |\n|-------|-----|\n| \"Video isn't on a watch page\" | Create dedicated video page or accept it's supplementary content |\n| \"No thumbnail URL provided\" | Add VideoObject schema with thumbnailUrl |\n| \"Video outside the viewport\" | Move video higher on page, ensure it's visible |\n| Page not indexed | Fix page indexing issues first |\n| Non-canonical page | Set proper canonical URL |\n\nThe bottom line: **Embedded YouTube videos on blog posts are intentionally not indexed by Google as separate video results** because they're already indexed on YouTube.

{"id":"websearch-708","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026\nBased on the comprehensive search results, I can now provide you with a complete answer on how to handle Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` in 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Clerk Webhook Events for Organization Events (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nClerk webhooks send HTTP POST requests to your endpoint when specific events occur. For organization events, you'll handle:\n- **`organization.created`** - Triggered when an organization is created\n- **`organization.updated`** - Triggered when organization info is updated\n- **`organization.deleted`** - Triggered when an organization is deleted\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Webhook Endpoint in Clerk Dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to the [**Webhooks**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/webhooks) page in the Clerk Dashboard\n2. Select **Add Endpoint**\n3. In the **Endpoint URL** field, enter your webhook URL (e.g., `https://your-app.com/api/webhooks`)\n4. In the **Subscribe to events** section, select:\n   - `organization.created`\n   - `organization.updated`\n   - `organization.deleted`\n5. Click **Create** and copy the **Signing Secret**\n\n### Step 2: Add Environment Variable\n\nAdd your signing secret to your `.env` file:\n\n```env\nCLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here\n```\n\n### Step 3: Ensure the Webhook Route is Public\n\nWebhook requests don't contain auth information, so the route must be public. In your middleware, ensure `/api/webhooks(.*)` is not protected.\n\n### Step 4: Create the Webhook Handler\n\n#### Next.js (App Router) Example:\n\n```typescript\n// app/api/webhooks/route.ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/nextjs/webhooks'\nimport { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function POST(req: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n\n    const eventType = evt.type\n\n    switch (eventType) {\n      case 'organization.created': {\n        const { id, name, slug, created_at, public_metadata, private_metadata } = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization created: ${name} (${id})`)\n        // Insert organization into your database\n        // await db.organization.create({ data: { clerkId: id, name, slug } })\n        break\n      }\n\n      case 'organization.updated': {\n        const { id, name, slug, updated_at, public_metadata, private_metadata } = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization updated: ${name} (${id})`)\n        // Update organization in your database\n        // await db.organization.update({ where: { clerkId: id }, data: { name, slug } })\n        break\n      }\n\n      case 'organization.deleted': {\n        const { id } = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization deleted: ${id}`)\n        // Delete or soft-delete organization from your database\n        // await db.organization.delete({ where: { clerkId: id } })\n        // or: await db.organization.update({ where: { clerkId: id }, data: { deleted: true } })\n        break\n      }\n\n      default:\n        console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${eventType}`)\n    }\n\n    return new Response('Webhook received', { status: 200 })\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err)\n    return new Response('Error verifying webhook', { status: 400 })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Express Example:\n\n```typescript\n// index.ts\nimport { verifyWebhook } from '@clerk/express/webhooks'\nimport express from 'express'\n\nconst app = express()\n\napp.post('/api/webhooks', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const evt = await verifyWebhook(req)\n\n    switch (evt.type) {\n      case 'organization.created':\n        const created = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization created: ${created.name} (${created.id})`)\n        // Handle organization creation\n        break\n\n      case 'organization.updated':\n        const updated = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization updated: ${updated.name} (${updated.id})`)\n        // Handle organization update\n        break\n\n      case 'organization.deleted':\n        const deleted = evt.data\n        console.log(`Organization deleted: ${deleted.id}`)\n        // Handle organization deletion\n        break\n    }\n\n    return res.send('Webhook received')\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err)\n    return res.status(400).send('Error verifying webhook')\n  }\n})\n\napp.listen(3000)\n```\n\n### Organization Webhook Payload Structure\n\nThe payload contains:\n- **`data`**: The organization object with properties like `id`, `name`, `slug`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `public_metadata`, `private_metadata`, etc.\n- **`object`**: Always `\"event\"`\n- **`type`**: The event type (e.g., `\"organization.created\"`)\n- **`timestamp`**: When the event occurred (in milliseconds)\n- **`instance_id`**: Your Clerk instance identifier\n\n### Related Organization Events\n\nConsider also handling these related events for complete organization lifecycle management:\n- **`organizationMembership.created`** - When a member is added\n- **`organizationMembership.updated`** - When a membership is updated\n- **`organizationMembership.deleted`** - When a member is removed\n- **`organizationDomain.created`** - When a domain is added\n- **`organizationDomain.updated`** - When a domain is updated\n- **`organizationDomain.deleted`** - When a domain is removed\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Always verify webhooks**: Use Clerk's `verifyWebhook()` function to validate the signature\n2. **Return 2xx status**: Return a 200-level response to acknowledge receipt; otherwise Clerk will retry\n3. **Handle retries**: Webhooks may be retried, so make your handlers idempotent\n4. **Log everything**: Log webhook events for debugging\n5. **Handle eventually consistency**: Webhook delivery is not guaranteed to be immediate\n\n### Local Development with ngrok\n\nFor local testing, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server:\n\n```bash\nngrok http --url=<YOUR_FORWARDING_URL> 3000\n```\n\nThen use the ngrok URL as your webhook endpoint in the Clerk Dashboard.","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and verify Clerk webhooks for organization events (specifically `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted`) and show, with example handler logic or pseudo-code, how to branch on `event.type` to create/update/delete corresponding organization records (or sync data) in the application’s backend, including basic security (signature verification) and reliability (handling retries/async nature).[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle Clerk webhook events for organization.created organization.updated and organization.deleted in 2026","timestamp":36404},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":36404},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_017EovBi1KcvJCs2J3oXwPo7","status":"completed","timestamp":36404},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01ECdDWs6JFJ9FUpRu8Jx9Xu","status":"completed","timestamp":36404},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":36404},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HeAtuhd1QMonCR8kEPYxEf","status":"completed","timestamp":36404},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the comprehensive search results, I can now provide you with a complete answer on how to handle Clerk webhook events for `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, and `organization.deleted` in 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Clerk Webhook Events for Organization Events (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nClerk webhooks send HTTP POST requests to your endpoint when specific events occur.

There are several libraries and approaches available for i18n code generation:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Lyricist (Recommended for Compose Multiplatform)**\n\nLyricist is a comprehensive i18n/L10N library specifically designed for Compose Multiplatform with KSP code generation.\n\n**Setup (build.gradle.kts):**\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    id(\"com.google.devtools.ksp\") version \"${ksp-latest-version}\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    // Core library\n    implementation(\"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist:${latest-version}\")\n    \n    // KSP processor for code generation\n    ksp(\"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor:${latest-version}\")\n    \n    // Optional: migrate from strings.xml\n    ksp(\"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor-xml:${latest-version}\")\n}\n```\n\n**Multiplatform KSP setup (commonMain generation):**\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor:${latest-version}\")\n}\n\ntasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinCompile<*>>().all {\n    if(name != \"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\") {\n        dependsOn(\"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\")\n    }\n}\n\nkotlin.sourceSets.commonMain {\n    kotlin.srcDir(\"build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin\")\n}\n```\n\n**Define strings with annotations:**\n```kotlin\ndata class Strings(\n    val greeting: String,\n    val parameter: (name: String) -> String,\n    val plural: (count: Int) -> String,\n)\n\n@LyricistStrings(languageTag = \"en\", default = true)\nval EnStrings = Strings(\n    greeting = \"Hello!\",\n    parameter = { name -> \"Welcome, $name\" },\n    plural = { count -> \n        when (count) {\n            0 -> \"No items\"\n            1 -> \"One item\"\n            else -> \"$count items\"\n        }\n    }\n)\n\n@LyricistStrings(languageTag = \"es\")\nval EsStrings = Strings(/* Spanish strings */)\n```\n\n**Usage in Compose:**\n```kotlin\nval lyricist = rememberStrings()\n\nProvideStrings(lyricist) {\n    val strings = LocalStrings.current\n    Text(strings.greeting)\n    Text(strings.parameter(\"John\"))\n}\n\n// Change locale dynamically\nlyricist.languageTag = \"es\"\n```\n\n**KSP 2.0 Configuration (gradle.properties):**\n```properties\nksp.useKsp2=true\nksp.incremental=true\nksp.incremental.log=false\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: MOKO Resources with Custom KSP Generator**\n\nMOKO Resources is a mature library for resource sharing. In 2026, a common pattern is combining MOKO with a custom Gradle task that uses KotlinPoet for type-safe code generation.\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\nbuildscript {\n    dependencies {\n        classpath(\"dev.icerock.moko:resources-generator:0.25.2\")\n    }\n}\n\nplugins {\n    id(\"dev.icerock.mobile.multiplatform-resources\")\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    commonMainApi(\"dev.icerock.moko:resources:0.25.2\")\n    commonMainApi(\"dev.icerock.moko:resources-compose:0.25.2\")\n}\n\nmultiplatformResources {\n    multiplatformResourcesPackage = \"com.example.app\"\n}\n```\n\n**Custom KSP-like generator (using KotlinPoet):**\n```kotlin\n// Custom Gradle task that reads MR.kt and generates type-safe wrappers\n@CacheableTask\nabstract class ResourceGeneratorTask : DefaultTask() {\n    @TaskAction\n    fun generate() {\n        // Read generated MR.kt, extract string keys\n        // Generate sealed class wrappers using KotlinPoet\n        stringResourceKeyFileSpec(stringKeys, mrClass).writeTo(outputDir)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Generated type-safe keys:**\n```kotlin\nsealed class StringResourceKey(val resourceId: StringResource) {\n    data object ButtonRetry : StringResourceKey(MR.strings.button_retry)\n    data object ErrorMessage : StringResourceKey(MR.strings.error_message)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: i18n4k**\n\nA multiplatform (JVM, JS, Native) library with Gradle-based code generation.\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    // For JVM\n    implementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core-jvm:<VERSION>\")\n    // For JS\n    implementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core-js:<VERSION>\")\n}\n```\n\nResources are defined in `src/commonMain/i18n/` and the plugin generates type-safe accessors.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Practices for 2026**\n\n1. **Migrate from KAPT to KSP** - KAPT is deprecated; KSP provides 2x faster builds and better multiplatform support\n\n2. **Use KSP 2.0** - Enable with `ksp.useKsp2=true` for K2 compiler compatibility\n\n3. **Modular i18n architecture** - Consider splitting into:\n   - `:i18n:generator` - Code generation plugin\n   - `:i18n:api` - Interface definitions\n   - `:i18n:implementation` - Platform-specific implementations\n\n4. **Keep strings in presentation layer** - Use a `Localizer` interface for testability:\n```kotlin\ninterface Localizer {\n    fun getString(key: StringResourceKey): String\n    fun getPlural(key: PluralsResourceKey, quantity: Int): String\n}\n```\n\n5. **Test your strings** - Write unit tests for localization logic using platform-specific test runners\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Library | KSP Support | Platforms | Best For |\n|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|\n| **Lyricist** | ✅ Native | Android, iOS, Desktop, Web | Compose Multiplatform |\n| **MOKO Resources** | Via custom task | Android, iOS, macOS, JVM, JS | Traditional resources |\n| **i18n4k** | Gradle plugin | JVM, JS, Native | Pure Kotlin projects |\n\nFor Compose Multiplatform projects in 2026, **Lyricist** with its native KSP support is the recommended choice due to its type-safe strings, dynamic locale switching, and seamless Compose integration.","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and run a KSP processor in a modern (K2-era) Kotlin Multiplatform project (e.g., using `ksp<target>`/`ksp<SourceSet>` and `kspCommonMainMetadata`) and show how that processor is used to generate type‑safe i18n resources or accessors from source files (such as message bundles) that work across platforms.

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?\nLet me get more detailed information from the official LangGraph documentation and some of the better sources:\nNow let me get the official LangGraph documentation for more details on HumanInterrupt types:\nI now have comprehensive information about LangGraph's human interrupt and resume functionality. Let me provide you with a complete answer.\n\n---\n\n## LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume in Python (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nLangGraph provides a powerful human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanism through the `interrupt()` function and `Command` object. This allows you to pause graph execution at any point, wait for external input, and resume execution dynamically.\n\n### Core Components\n\n#### 1. **The `interrupt()` Function**\n\nThe `interrupt()` function pauses graph execution and returns a value to the caller:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval - payload surfaces in result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n    approved = interrupt(\"Do you approve this action?\")\n    \n    # When you resume with Command(resume=...), that value becomes 'approved'\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n```\n\n#### 2. **The `Command` Object**\n\nUsed to resume execution and optionally route to different nodes:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\n\n# Resume with a simple value\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\n\n# Resume with structured data\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume={\"action\": \"approve\", \"comment\": \"Looks good!\"}), config=config)\n\n# Resume and route to a specific node\nreturn Command(goto=\"next_node\")\n```\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. **A Checkpointer** -

Let me provide you with a complete answer.\n\n---\n\n## LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume in Python (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nLangGraph provides a powerful human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanism through the `interrupt()` function and `Command` object. This allows you to pause graph execution at any point, wait for external input, and resume execution dynamically.\n\n### Core Components\n\n#### 1. **The `interrupt()` Function**\n\nThe `interrupt()` function pauses graph execution and returns a value to the caller:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\ndef approval_node(state: State):\n    # Pause and ask for approval - payload surfaces in result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n    approved = interrupt(\"Do you approve this action?\")\n    \n    # When you resume with Command(resume=...), that value becomes 'approved'\n    return {\"approved\": approved}\n```\n\n#### 2. **The `Command` Object**\n\nUsed to resume execution and optionally route to different nodes:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\n\n# Resume with a simple value\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\n\n# Resume with structured data\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume={\"action\": \"approve\", \"comment\": \"Looks good!\"}), config=config)\n\n# Resume and route to a specific node\nreturn Command(goto=\"next_node\")\n```\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. **A Checkpointer** - Required to persist graph state during pauses:\n   ```python\n   from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n   # Or for production:\n   from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\n   ```\n\n2. **A Thread ID** - Associates execution with a conversation thread:\n   ```python\n   config = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"thread-123\"}}\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### HumanInterrupt Types (Structured Interrupts)\n\nFor more sophisticated HITL workflows, LangGraph provides typed interrupt schemas:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents.interrupt import (\n    HumanInterrupt,\n    HumanInterruptConfig,\n    ActionRequest,\n)\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt.interrupt import HumanResponse\n```\n\n#### **ActionRequest**\nRepresents a request for human action:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents.interrupt import ActionRequest\n\naction = ActionRequest(\n    action=\"send_email\",  # The action being requested\n    args={\"to\": \"user@example.com\", \"subject\": \"Meeting\"}  # Arguments for the action\n)\n```\n\n#### **HumanInterruptConfig**\nDefines what actions are allowed for a human interrupt:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents.interrupt import HumanInterruptConfig\n\nconfig = HumanInterruptConfig(\n    allow_ignore=True,    # Allow skipping this step\n    allow_respond=True,   # Allow text feedback\n    allow_edit=True,      # Allow editing the content\n    allow_accept=True     # Allow direct acceptance/approval\n)\n```\n\n#### **HumanInterrupt**\nCombines the action request with configuration:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents.interrupt import HumanInterrupt, ActionRequest, HumanInterruptConfig\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\n\nrequest = HumanInterrupt(\n    action_request=ActionRequest(\n        action=\"run_command\",\n        args={\"command\": \"rm\", \"args\": [\"-rf\", \"/tmp/cache\"]}\n    ),\n    config=HumanInterruptConfig(\n        allow_ignore=True,\n        allow_respond=True,\n        allow_edit=False,\n        allow_accept=True\n    ),\n    description=\"Please review the command before execution\"\n)\n\n# Send the interrupt and get the response\nresponse = interrupt([request])[0]\n```\n\n#### **HumanResponse**\nThe response provided by a human to an interrupt:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt.interrupt import HumanResponse\n\n# Response types:\n# -

For example, a package in `src/encoding/base64` is imported as `\"encoding/base64\"` but has the name `base64`, not `encoding_base64` or `encodingBase64`.\n\n4. **Avoid redundancy** - Don't reuse the package name in function names.

/* Safari support */\n  \n  /* Smooth transition for hover effect */\n  transition: 0.4s;\n}\n```\n\n### Radial Gradient Hover Effect with Dynamic Position\n\nTo create an interactive hover effect where the radial gradient follows the cursor or animates on hover, use CSS custom properties:\n\n```css\n.hover-text {\n  --x: 50%;\n  --y: 50%;\n  \n  color: transparent;\n  background: radial-gradient(\n    circle at var(--x) var(--y),\n    #ff00ff 0%,\n    #00ffff 50%,\n    #333 100%\n  );\n  background-clip: text;\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n  transition: --x 0.3s, --y 0.3s;\n}\n\n.hover-text:hover {\n  --x: 70%;\n  --y: 30%;\n}\n```\n\n### Mouse-Tracking Spotlight Effect\n\nFor a more advanced \"spotlight\" effect that follows the mouse cursor:\n\n```html\n<h1 class=\"spotlight-text\" data-text=\"Hover Me\">Hover Me</h1>\n```\n\n```css\n.spotlight-text {\n  --mouse-x: 50%;\n  --mouse-y: 50%;\n  \n  color: transparent;\n  background: radial-gradient(\n    circle 150px at var(--mouse-x) var(--mouse-y),\n    #fff 0%,\n    #666 100%\n  );\n  background-clip: text;\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst text = document.querySelector('.spotlight-text');\n\ntext.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {\n  const rect = text.getBoundingClientRect();\n  const x = ((e.clientX - rect.left) / rect.width) * 100;\n  const y = ((e.clientY - rect.top) / rect.height) * 100;\n  \n  text.style.setProperty('--mouse-x', `${x}%`);\n  text.style.setProperty('--mouse-y', `${y}%`);\n});\n```\n\n### Layered Gradient with Hover Transition\n\nSince gradients can't be directly transitioned, use opacity on layered pseudo-elements:\n\n```css\n.layered-text {\n  position: relative;\n  color: transparent;\n  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #333, #666);\n  background-clip: text;\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n}\n\n.layered-text::before {\n  content: attr(data-text);\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  background: radial-gradient(circle at 50% 50%, #00f 0%, #0ff 100%);\n  background-clip: text;\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n  color: transparent;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.layered-text:hover::before {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points for 2026\n\n1. **Browser Support**: `background-clip: text` is widely supported, but always include `-webkit-background-clip: text` for Safari compatibility.\n\n2. **Accessibility**: Ensure text remains readable and use `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion.\n\n3. **Performance**: For mouse-tracking effects, use CSS custom properties updated via JavaScript for smooth, GPU-accelerated animations.\n\n4. **Modern Syntax**: Radial gradient transitions now work in modern browsers including Edge 17+ without prefixes.","hint":"A good answer must explain using `background-clip: text` (and `-webkit-background-clip: text` for compatibility) with transparent text color to reveal a gradient, specify a `radial-gradient()` as the background image, and show how to change that gradient or its position/opacity on `:hover` (e.g., via `transition` on `background`/`background-position`) to create the overlay hover effect in modern 2026 browsers.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use CSS background-clip text with a radial gradient overlay hover effect in 2026?","timestamp":21694},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":21694},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Nc6w683YyK1PzSLPKVf4JL","status":"completed","timestamp":21694},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive answer on how to use CSS `background-clip: text` with a radial gradient overlay hover effect in 2026.\n\n## CSS Background-Clip Text with Radial Gradient Hover Effect\n\n### Basic Technique\n\nThe `background-clip: text` property clips a background to the shape of the text itself, allowing you to fill text with gradients, images, or patterns.\n\n```css\n.gradient-text {\n  /* Make text transparent so gradient shows through */\n  color: transparent;\n  \n  /* Apply radial gradient as background */\n  background: radial-gradient(circle, #d402f9 28%, #fafb3d 53%, #00d4ff 100%);\n  \n  /* Clip background to text shape */\n  background-clip: text;\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;

Govulncheck analyzes code using the Go version found on PATH, which may differ from your project's requirements.\n\n### 2. **GOEXPERIMENT Incompatibilities**\nAs of Go 1.25+, using `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` can cause govulncheck to panic when scanning code that imports `encoding/json`. This affects projects using experimental JSON features.\n\n### 3. **Invalid go.mod Version Format**\nThe `go` directive in go.mod must follow the format `1.x` (e.g., `go 1.23`). Patch versions like `1.22.1` are invalid and cause parsing errors.\n\n### 4. **Outdated govulncheck Version**\nUsing an older govulncheck version with newer Go releases (like Go 1.25/1.26) can cause compatibility issues, as govulncheck needs updates to support new language features.\n\n### 5. **Missing or Incorrect Go Binary Path**\nGovulncheck requires a `go` binary on PATH. If the binary is missing or points to an incompatible version, scanning fails.\n\n---\n\n## How to Resolve These Issues\n\n### **1. Align Go Versions**\n```bash\n# Check your current Go version\ngo version\n\n# Install govulncheck with the same Go version you use for building\ngo install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest\n\n# Verify govulncheck version\ngovulncheck -version\n```\n\n### **2. Use the Correct Go Version for Your Project**\n```bash\n# Ensure the Go version in go.mod matches your installed version\n# In go.mod, use format: go 1.25 (not go 1.25.1)\n\n# If using multiple Go versions, set PATH explicitly\nexport PATH=/usr/local/go1.25/bin:$PATH\ngovulncheck ./...\n```\n\n### **3. Fix GOEXPERIMENT Issues (Go 1.25+)**\n```bash\n# Temporarily disable jsonv2 experiment when running govulncheck\nGOEXPERIMENT= govulncheck ./...\n```\n\n### **4. Update govulncheck Regularly**\n```bash\n# Always use the latest version\ngo install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest\n\n# Check for updates to govulncheck-vulndb as well (for package managers)\n```\n\n### **5. Correct go.mod Format**\n```go\n// Correct format in go.mod\ngo 1.25\n\n// Use toolchain directive for specific version if needed\ntoolchain go1.25.5\n```\n\n### **6. CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices**\n```yaml\n# Ensure Go version consistency in CI\n- name: Setup Go\n  uses: actions/setup-go@v5\n  with:\n    go-version: '1.25'\n    \n- name: Install govulncheck\n  run: go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest\n  \n- name: Run vulnerability check\n  run: govulncheck ./...\n```\n\n### **7.

Build your binaries with Go 1.18+ for full vulnerability detection.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| \"package requires newer Go version\" | Update Go to match go.mod requirements |\n| Panic with GOEXPERIMENT | Run without experimental features |\n| \"no matching versions for query\" | Check network/proxy settings, retry |\n| Standard library vulnerabilities | Update Go version as indicated in report |\n| Invalid go version in go.mod | Use `go 1.x` format, not patch versions |","hint":"A good answer must note that govulncheck’s compatibility issues typically stem from mismatches between (a) the Go toolchain version in PATH and the version required by the module/tool (including `go`/`toolchain` directives in `go.mod` and CI settings) and (b) the Go version used to build or run govulncheck, causing errors like “package requires newer Go version” or use of an unavailable toolchain.

Here's the quality assessment:\n\n### Quality Characteristics:\n1. **Gap Transparency**: HistData.com is transparent about data quality - for each downloaded file, they provide:\n   - Maximum gap found (in milliseconds)\n   - All gaps larger than 1 minute (in seconds)\n   - Average tick interval (in milliseconds)\n\n2. **Expected Gaps**: According to their FAQ:\n   - Gaps of **>90 seconds** are normal during low trading volume periods\n   - Some gaps are due to normal Forex trading pause periods (weekends, holidays)\n   - They measure all gaps bigger than 1 minute\n\n3. **Price Data**: Bar prices (Open, High, Low, Close) are based on **tick Bid price**. Ask price is only included in Generic ASCII format tick data.\n\n4. **No Volume Data**: Volume information is removed since forex volumes are broker-specific and not aggregated.\n\n5. **No Warranty**: The data is free, so no warranty or certification is provided. HistData states: \"Use the data at your own will and risk.\"\n\n### 2026 Data Availability:\n**Important limitation**: Based on my search, HistData.com's most recent data updates appear to be from **September 2025** (last updated: 2025-09-09).

Let me compile a complete guide:\n\n## How to Set Up Web Push Notifications for Web Apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4+\n\n### Overview\n\nStarting with **iOS 16.4** (released March 2023), Apple supports Web Push notifications for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) added to the Home Screen. This uses the standard W3C **Push API**, **Notifications API**, and **Service Workers**.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n1. **iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or later** (also works on Chrome and Edge on iOS 16.4+)\n2. **User must add your web app to the Home Screen** (not available in Safari browser directly)\n3. **Web app must have a manifest.json** with `display: standalone` or `display: fullscreen`\n4. **VAPID keys** (no Apple Developer Program membership required)\n5. **Permission request must be triggered by user interaction** (e.g., button click)\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Generate VAPID Keys\n\nYou don't need to register with Apple. Generate your own VAPID keys:\n\n```bash\nnpx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n```\n\nThis outputs:\n```\nPublic Key: BAwUJxIa7mJZMqu78Tfy2vqbp1tFuj4KwX3gRuF2e_5WGB0tGnvCBGtvVDEa6YdjnjAors3E1WBlcCTow6pGg\nPrivate Key: Mmi54fYPtCgTQB1_8-QoH0xJOq3H6z8nBUG71t0ezCA\n```\n\n**Keep your private key secure** – it's used on your server to send notifications.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Create manifest.json\n\nPlace this at your website root:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"App\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> **Critical**: `\"display\": \"standalone\"` is required for iOS Web Push. Without it, `pushManager` will be undefined.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Link manifest in HTML\n\n```html\n<html>\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n  <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <!-- Your app content -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Create the Service Worker (serviceworker.js)\n\n```javascript\n// serviceworker.js - place at root of your domain\n\nself.addEventListener('push', (event) => {\n  const data = event.data ? event.data.json() : {};\n  const title = data.title || 'Notification';\n  const options = {\n    body: data.body || '',\n    icon: data.icon || '/icon-192.png',\n    badge: data.badge || '/badge-72.png',\n    data: data.data || {}\n  };\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification(title, options)\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', (event) => {\n  event.notification.close();\n  \n  const url = event.notification.data?.url || '/';\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow(url)\n  );\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Frontend JavaScript (frontend.js)\n\n```javascript\nconst VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';\n\n// Check if running as installed PWA (Home Screen app)\nfunction isInstalledPWA() {\n  return window.navigator.standalone === true;\n}\n\n// Register service worker\nasync function registerServiceWorker() {\n  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n    try {\n      const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/serviceworker.js');\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n      return registration;\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    }\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\n// Subscribe to push notifications\nasync function subscribeToPush() {\n  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n  \n  // Check if pushManager is available (only in Home Screen web apps on iOS)\n  if (!registration.pushManager) {\n    console.log('Push notifications not supported. Add to Home Screen first.');\n    return null;\n  }\n  \n  try {\n    const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n      userVisibleOnly: true,\n      applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array(VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY)\n    });\n    \n    console.log('Push subscription:', JSON.stringify(subscription));\n    \n    // Send subscription to your server\n    await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n    \n    return subscription;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Push subscription failed:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Helper function to convert VAPID key\nfunction urlBase64ToUint8Array(base64String) {\n  const padding = '='.repeat((4 - base64String.length % 4) % 4);\n  const base64 = (base64String + padding)\n    .replace(/-/g, '+')\n    .replace(/_/g, '/');\n  \n  const rawData = window.atob(base64);\n  const outputArray = new Uint8Array(rawData.length);\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i) {\n    outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt(i);\n  }\n  return outputArray;\n}\n\n// Send subscription to your backend\nasync function sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription) {\n  await fetch('/api/push-subscribe', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify(subscription)\n  });\n}\n\n// Initialize\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {\n  await registerServiceWorker();\n  \n  // Check if installed as PWA\n  if (!isInstalledPWA()) {\n    // Show \"Add to Home Screen\" prompt to users\n    document.getElementById('install-prompt').style.display = 'block';\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // Show subscribe button (must be triggered by user action!)\n  document.getElementById('subscribe-btn').addEventListener('click', async () => {\n    const subscription = await subscribeToPush();\n    if (subscription) {\n      alert('Successfully subscribed to notifications!');\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Backend: Sending Push Notifications (Node.js Example)\n\n```javascript\n// backend-sender.js\nconst webpush = require('web-push');\n\n// Configure VAPID\nwebpush.setVapidDetails(\n  'mailto:your-email@example.com',\n  'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY',\n  'YOUR_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY'\n);\n\n// Subscription object from the frontend\nconst subscription = {\n  endpoint: 'https://web.push.apple.com/QGuQyavXutnMH...',\n  keys: {\n    p256dh: 'BF6-hyiRMKKKiiH...',\n    auth: 'lM6vKjBJ1UX...'\n  }\n};\n\n// Send notification\nconst payload = JSON.stringify({\n  title: 'Hello from your PWA!',\n  body: 'This is a push notification',\n  icon: '/icon-192.png',\n  data: {\n    url: 'https://yourapp.com/some-page'\n  }\n});\n\nwebpush.sendNotification(subscription, payload)\n  .then(result => console.log('Push sent:', result))\n  .catch(error => console.error('Push failed:', error));\n```\n\n**Important**: Allow URLs from `*.push.apple.com` if you control your server's firewall/network.\n\n---\n\n### User Flow\n\n1. User visits your website in Safari on iOS 16.4+\n2. User taps **Share button** → **\"Add to Home Screen\"**\n3. User opens the app from their Home Screen (now runs as standalone PWA)\n4. User clicks a \"Subscribe\" button (user interaction required!)\n5. iOS shows native permission prompt\n6. Once granted, user receives notifications like any native app\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes & Limitations\n\n| Feature | iOS Web Push Support |\n|---------|---------------------|\n| Basic notifications | ✅ Yes |\n| Notification icon | ✅ Yes (from manifest) |\n| Action buttons | ❌ Not supported |\n| Rich media/images | ❌ Limited support |\n| Badging API | ✅ Yes (iOS 16.4+) |\n| Focus mode integration | ✅ Yes |\n| Apple Watch mirroring | ✅ Yes |\n\n- **No APNs certificate required** – VAPID keys are sufficient\n- **Safari in-browser push is NOT supported on iOS** – only Home Screen web apps\n- **Permission must be requested from user gesture** (button click, etc.)\n- Notifications work with Focus mode and show on Apple Watch\n\n---\n\n### Testing Tips\n\n1. Use a real iOS device (iOS Simulator doesn't support push)\n2. Verify manifest.json loads correctly (Chrome DevTools → Application tab)\n3. Check `window.navigator.standalone` is `true` when running from Home Screen\n4. Verify `registration.pushManager` exists (only available in installed PWA)\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Apple Official Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending-web-push-notifications-in-web-apps-and-browsers)\n- [WebKit Blog: Web Push for iOS](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/)\n- [GitHub Demo: webpush-ios-example](https://github.com/andreinwald/webpush-ios-example)\n- [WWDC 2022: Meet Web Push](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10098/)","hint":"A correct answer must explain that web push on iOS/iPadOS only works for Safari-installed Home Screen web apps (PWAs) on iOS 16.4+ and must outline the core technical setup: HTTPS PWA with web app manifest and service worker, using the standard Push API/Notification API flow (register service worker, request permission on a user gesture inside the Home Screen app, obtain push subscription, and send via Apple’s Web Push/APNs endpoints) in line with Apple’s 2025/modern documentation.【page2websearch1 page6websearch1 page7websearch1 page9websearch1 page12websearch1 page16websearch1 page18websearch1","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up web push notifications for web apps on Apple Safari iOS 16.4 using the Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documentation","timestamp":56604},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":56604},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01BsjECjERYJ2imsxRyqcAnM","status":"completed","timestamp":56604},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed implementation information from the Apple developer documentation:","timestamp":56604},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":56604},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01DkNweYDYJziFw6nfvTox9b","status":"completed","timestamp":56604},{"type":"message","content":"Now let me search for more implementation details and code examples:","timestamp":56604},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01LPcwrdkxttgsTEMAg2mdeD","status":"completed","timestamp":56604},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed implementation examples:","timestamp":56604},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01UWVPGkGEKEfsgaEKAYj5qf","status":"completed","timestamp":56604},{"type":"message","content":"Now I have comprehensive information.

For known failure scenarios, use more specific status codes. Debugging requires a systematic approach: validate inputs, check logs, test directly, and use proper monitoring tools.","hint":"A good answer should explain that HTTP 500 errors on REST API customer endpoints usually stem from server-side problems such as unhandled exceptions, backend dependency failures (e.g., database or third-party services), misconfigurations, or resource limits, and distinguish them from 4xx client errors as “unexpected server conditions.”[[1, 2, 3, 4]] It must also outline concrete 2026-relevant debugging practices—such as examining server and backend logs, enabling debug/trace in the API stack or gateway, using centralized logging and correlation IDs, reproducing the failing request in a controlled environment, and monitoring/alerting around 5xx rates—to systematically identify root causes and validate fixes.[[5, 6, 7, 8]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026?","timestamp":20337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":20337},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0166E8aqeDhCShwsCp7puEan","status":"completed","timestamp":20337},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive answer about common causes of 500 errors in REST API customer endpoints and how to debug them in 2026:\n\n## Common Causes of 500 Errors in REST API Customer Endpoints\n\n### 1. **Server-Side Code Errors**\n- Unhandled exceptions in backend logic\n- Syntax errors in database queries (SOQL, SQL, etc.)\n- Null pointer exceptions or missing data handling\n- Edge cases triggered by specific request parameters\n\n### 2. **Infrastructure Issues**\n- Database connection pool exhaustion\n- Service outages or backend server failures\n- Memory or resource limitations\n- Misconfigured servers or services\n\n### 3. **Data-Related Problems**\n- Invalid or corrupted data in the database\n- Missing required resources\n- Data type mismatches between API and database\n\n### 4. **Configuration Issues**\n- Incorrect or outdated endpoint URLs\n- Misconfigured API gateways or proxies\n- Environment-specific configuration problems\n\n### 5. **Third-Party Service Failures**\n- Backend services returning errors\n- External API timeouts or failures\n\n---\n\n## How to Debug 500 Errors (2026 Best Practices)\n\n### 1. **Check Server Logs First**\n- Review application and server logs for detailed error messages\n- Look for stack traces that pinpoint the exact line of failure\n- Enable debug mode on backend servers if possible\n\n### 2. **Use API Debugging Tools**\n- **Postman** or REST clients to reproduce the error\n- **API monitoring tools** (like Apigee, Treblle) for centralized error tracking\n- Test backend servers directly from message processors to isolate issues\n\n### 3. **Validate Response Status Codes**\n- A 500 error indicates a server-side issue—focus investigation there\n- Check if the error is intermittent (infrastructure) or consistent (code bug)\n\n### 4. **Implement Centralized Error Handling**\n```javascript\n// Example Express.js error handler\napp.use((err, req, res, next) => {\n  if (res.headersSent) {\n    return next(err);\n  }\n  const status = err.status || 500;\n  res.status(status).json({\n    error: {\n      message: err.message,\n      code: status,\n      details: err.details || null\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### 5. **Use Retry Strategies**\n- Implement **exponential backoff** for intermittent 500 errors\n- Set appropriate timeouts for upstream services\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for Error Responses**\n- Return the most specific error code possible (e.g., 404 for missing resources instead of generic 500)\n- Include meaningful error messages in responses\n- Never expose internal stack traces to clients in production (security risk)\n\n### 7. **Debugging Checklist**\n1. ✅ Verify request syntax and data parameters\n2. ✅ Check server logs for error details\n3. ✅ Test the endpoint directly (bypassing proxies if needed)\n4. ✅ Review recent code changes that might have introduced bugs\n5. ✅ Contact API provider if the issue is on their end\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway**: 500 errors should only be used for truly unexpected conditions (like service outages).

{"id":"websearch-1267","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to set up shadcn UI in a Turborepo monorepo 2026 tutorial\nBased on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **How to Set Up shadcn/UI in a Turborepo Monorepo (2026)**.\n\n---\n\n## Complete Guide: Setting Up shadcn/UI in a Turborepo Monorepo\n\n### Prerequisites\n- **Node.js** v18+\n- **pnpm** v10+ (recommended package manager)\n- **TypeScript** v5+\n- **Next.js** v16 (or Vite for non-Next apps)\n- **Tailwind CSS** v4\n- **Turbo** v2\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Turborepo Project\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-tailwind\n```\n\nThis creates a monorepo with:\n- `apps/` - Contains your applications (web, docs, etc.)\n- `packages/` - Contains shared packages (ui, configs, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the UI Package\n\nNavigate to `packages/ui` and configure it for shadcn:\n\n#### 2.1 Modify `tsconfig.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.2 Create `components.json`\nCreate `packages/ui/components.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json\",\n  \"style\": \"new-york\",\n  \"rsc\": true,\n  \"tsx\": true,\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"css\": \"src/styles.css\",\n    \"baseColor\": \"slate\",\n    \"cssVariables\": true\n  },\n  \"iconLibrary\": \"lucide\",\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm add class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react tw-animate-css\npnpm add -D tsup\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Create the `cn` Utility Function\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Configure tsup (Critical Step!)\n\nCreate `packages/ui/tsup.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from \"tsup\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  entry: [\"src/**/*.tsx\", \"src/**/*.ts\", \"src/styles.css\"],\n  format: [\"esm\"],\n  dts: true,\n  sourcemap: true,\n  clean: true,\n  outDir: \"dist/tsup\",\n  external: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"],\n  tsconfig: \"./tsconfig.json\",\n});\n```\n\n> **Why tsup?** The default `tsc` doesn't resolve path aliases (`@/`) in the built output, causing import errors when apps consume the package. `tsup` properly resolves these paths.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Update Package Scripts\n\nIn `packages/ui/package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:components\": \"tsup\",\n    \"check-types\": \"tsup --dts\",\n    \"dev:components\": \"tsup --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Configure Package Exports\n\nIn `packages/ui/package.json`, add exports:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"exports\": {\n    \"./styles.css\": \"./dist/index.css\",\n    \"./shadcn/ui/*\": \"./dist/tsup/components/ui/*.mjs\",\n    \"./lib/*\": \"./dist/tsup/lib/*.mjs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Add shadcn Components\n\n```bash\ncd packages/ui\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card\n# Add any other components you need\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Set Up Styles\n\nCreate `packages/ui/src/styles.css`:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@import \"@repo/tailwind-config\";\n@import \"tw-animate-css\";\n\n@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));\n\n:root {\n  /* Your CSS variables here */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Use Components in Your Apps\n\nIn your app (e.g., `apps/web`), import components:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button\";\nimport { Card } from \"@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/card\";\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Card>\n      <Button variant=\"outline\">Click me</Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final Project Structure\n\n```\n.\n├── apps/\n│   ├── web/\n│   └── docs/\n├── packages/\n│   ├── ui/\n│   │   ├── src/\n│   │   │   ├── components/ui/\n│   │   │   ├── lib/utils.ts\n│   │   │   └── styles.css\n│   │   ├── components.json\n│   │   ├── tsconfig.json\n│   │   ├── tsup.config.ts\n│   │   └──

Issues\n\n| Error | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| `Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'` | Ensure tsup is configured and `tsconfig.json` has the `@/*` path alias |\n| `Module not found '@repo/ui/shadcn/ui/button'` | Run `pnpm run build:components` and verify exports in `package.json` |\n| Components have improper styling | Ensure `@repo/tailwind-config` is imported in your CSS files |\n| CSS file keeps deleting | Use `outDir: \"dist/tsup\"` in tsup config to separate CSS and component builds |\n\n---\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- **Official shadcn/ui Monorepo Docs**:

Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install swiper\n```\n\n### 2. Create the Slider Component\n\n```jsx\n// components/ImageSlider.jsx\n'use client'; // Required for Next.js App Router\n\nimport { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from 'swiper/react';\nimport { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, A11y } from 'swiper/modules';\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\n// Import Swiper styles\nimport 'swiper/css';\nimport 'swiper/css/navigation';\nimport 'swiper/css/pagination';\n\nconst images = [\n  { src: '/images/slide1.jpg', alt: 'Slide 1' },\n  { src: '/images/slide2.jpg', alt: 'Slide 2' },\n  { src: '/images/slide3.jpg', alt: 'Slide 3' },\n];\n\nexport default function ImageSlider() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"slider-container\">\n      <Swiper\n        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, A11y]}\n        spaceBetween={0}\n        slidesPerView={1}\n        navigation\n        pagination={{ clickable: true }}\n        autoplay={{ delay: 5000, disableOnInteraction: false }}\n        loop={true}\n        style={{ width: '100%', height: '100vh' }} // Full-width & full-height\n      >\n        {images.map((image, index) => (\n          <SwiperSlide key={index}>\n            <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', height: '100%' }}>\n              <Image\n                src={image.src}\n                alt={image.alt}\n                fill\n                sizes=\"100vw\"\n                style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}\n                priority={index === 0} // Prioritize first image\n              />\n            </div>\n          </SwiperSlide>\n        ))}\n      </Swiper>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Key Concepts Explained\n\n#### **Making Next.js Image Full-Width & Responsive**\n- Use `fill` prop to make the image fill its parent container\n- Set `sizes=\"100vw\"` to indicate the image spans 100% viewport width\n- Use `style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}` to maintain aspect ratio while covering the container\n- The parent container must have `position: relative` with defined dimensions\n\n#### **Swiper Configuration**\n- `slidesPerView={1}` - Shows one slide at a time for full-width effect\n- `spaceBetween={0}` - No gap between slides\n- `loop={true}` - Enables infinite looping\n- Import only the modules you need for better performance\n\n### 4. Add Custom Styling (Optional)\n\n```css\n/* styles/slider.css */\n.slider-container {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100vh; /* Or any height you prefer */\n}\n\n/* Custom navigation buttons */\n.swiper-button-next,\n.swiper-button-prev {\n  color: white;\n}\n\n/* Custom pagination bullets */\n.swiper-pagination-bullet {\n  background: white;\n  opacity: 0.7;\n}\n\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. For Remote Images\n\nIf using remote images, configure `next.config.js`:\n\n```js\n// next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'your-image-domain.com',\n        pathname: '/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### 6. Responsive Breakpoints Example\n\nFor different slides per view on different screens:\n\n```jsx\n<Swiper\n  modules={[Navigation, Pagination]}\n  breakpoints={{\n    320: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    768: { slidesPerView: 2, spaceBetween: 20 },\n    1024: { slidesPerView: 3, spaceBetween: 30 },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* slides */}\n</Swiper>\n```\n\n### Key Tips:\n1. **Always use `'use client'`** directive in Next.js App Router for Swiper components\n2. **Set `priority`** on the first image to improve LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n3. **Use `fill` + `sizes`** for responsive full-width images\n4. **Import only needed Swiper modules** to reduce bundle size\n5. **Use `placeholder=\"blur\"`** with static imports for better UX during loading","hint":"A correct answer should describe using Swiper’s React integration with Next.js in a client component (`'use client'`), importing `Swiper`/`SwiperSlide` and Swiper CSS, and rendering slides that use the Next.js `Image` component (typically with `fill`/responsive layout and parent with relative positioning) to achieve a full-width, responsive slider; it should also mention configuring Swiper options (e.g., breakpoints or `slidesPerView`, navigation/pagination) so the slider adapts to different screen sizes.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to build a full width responsive image slider using next.js image component and swiper 2026","timestamp":27527},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":27527},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01JoNaddni3t4Pz9KouAKAXN","status":"completed","timestamp":27527},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":27527},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019pJHTwL17VmLaAWQPgn2Xv","status":"completed","timestamp":27527},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive guide on **how to build a full-width responsive image slider using Next.js Image component and Swiper in 2026**:\n\n## Full-Width Responsive Image Slider with Next.js + Swiper\n\n### 1.

For Remote Images\n\nIf using remote images, configure `next.config.js`:\n\n```js\n// next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'your-image-domain.com',\n        pathname: '/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### 6. Responsive Breakpoints Example\n\nFor different slides per view on different screens:\n\n```jsx\n<Swiper\n  modules={[Navigation, Pagination]}\n  breakpoints={{\n    320: { slidesPerView: 1 },\n    768: { slidesPerView: 2, spaceBetween: 20 },\n    1024: { slidesPerView: 3, spaceBetween: 30 },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* slides */}\n</Swiper>\n```\n\n### Key Tips:\n1. **Always use `'use client'`** directive in Next.js App Router for Swiper components\n2. **Set `priority`** on the first image to improve LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n3. **Use `fill` + `sizes`** for responsive full-width images\n4. **Import only needed Swiper modules** to reduce bundle size\n5. **Use `placeholder=\"blur\"`** with static imports for better UX during loading","timestamp":27527}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Next.js_Image_Slider","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770548915215,"end":1770548942742,"firstResponse":27527,"sessionCreation":0,"total":27527},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Let me search for more specific details about their recent strategies:\nNow I have a comprehensive picture of Locket's marketing strategy. Let me summarize the story:\n\n## The Story Behind Locket Widget's Marketing Strategy in 2026\n\n### Origins: A Love Story Turned Viral App\nLocket Widget began as a personal project when **Matt Moss** built a simple photo widget as a gift for his girlfriend. What started as a small act of love turned into one of the most viral apps on the App Store, launching in 2022 and quickly competing with BeReal for authentic social sharing.\n\n### The TikTok-First Growth Strategy\nLocket's marketing strategy has been remarkably innovative and data-driven:\n\n1. **Nano-Influencer Army**: Locket partnered with **26 ambassador accounts** and hundreds of nano/micro-influencers, paying them one-off fees to create uniform videos. Their strategy was based on volume—by distributing content across numerous accounts, they ensured that statistically, at least one out of every N videos would go viral.\n\n2. **Three Viral Hooks**: The company identified **three main hook families** that drove most of their viral reach. Their top performer, @kaias_lensss, used the same hook dozens of times and consistently achieved millions of views.\n\n3. **Staggering Results**: This systematic approach generated **298 million+ views** on TikTok and helped the app reach **250+ million views**, maintaining a consistent top 5-10 ranking on the App Store.\n\n4. **Response Video Retargeting**: Whenever an influencer's video gained momentum, Locket commissioned follow-up response videos to comments, using them as free retargeting tools.\n\n### Evolution: Celebrity Lockets (2025-2026)\nTo drive additional growth heading into 2026, Locket launched **\"Celebrity Lockets\"**—a feature allowing music artists like Suki Waterhouse and JVKE to share updates directly to fans' home screens.

Let me summarize the story:\n\n## The Story Behind Locket Widget's Marketing Strategy in 2026\n\n### Origins: A Love Story Turned Viral App\nLocket Widget began as a personal project when **Matt Moss** built a simple photo widget as a gift for his girlfriend. What started as a small act of love turned into one of the most viral apps on the App Store, launching in 2022 and quickly competing with BeReal for authentic social sharing.\n\n### The TikTok-First Growth Strategy\nLocket's marketing strategy has been remarkably innovative and data-driven:\n\n1. **Nano-Influencer Army**: Locket partnered with **26 ambassador accounts** and hundreds of nano/micro-influencers, paying them one-off fees to create uniform videos. Their strategy was based on volume—by distributing content across numerous accounts, they ensured that statistically, at least one out of every N videos would go viral.\n\n2. **Three Viral Hooks**: The company identified **three main hook families** that drove most of their viral reach. Their top performer, @kaias_lensss, used the same hook dozens of times and consistently achieved millions of views.\n\n3. **Staggering Results**: This systematic approach generated **298 million+ views** on TikTok and helped the app reach **250+ million views**, maintaining a consistent top 5-10 ranking on the App Store.\n\n4. **Response Video Retargeting**: Whenever an influencer's video gained momentum, Locket commissioned follow-up response videos to comments, using them as free retargeting tools.\n\n### Evolution: Celebrity Lockets (2025-2026)\nTo drive additional growth heading into 2026, Locket launched **\"Celebrity Lockets\"**—a feature allowing music artists like Suki Waterhouse and JVKE to share updates directly to fans' home screens. This creates unprecedented intimacy between celebrities and fans, with artists able to connect with 1,000 to 15,000 fans directly on their phone's home screen.\n\n### 2026 Status\nAs of early 2026, Locket has achieved:\n- **80+ million total downloads**\n- **9+ million daily active users**\n- **10+ billion photos shared**\n- Reached **profitability in 2024** with only $12.5 million in fundraising\n- Estimated **$13.5 million/year** in revenue\n- Won an **Apple Cultural Impact Award** in 2025\n\nThe app remains a prominent example of how **systematic TikTok influencer marketing** combined with **authentic user experiences** can drive massive consumer app growth, making it a case study cited in 2026 marketing trend reports as a \"teen-only platform gaining traction.\"","timestamp":31577}],"metadata":{"category":"General_Knowledge","subcategory":"Business","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770549070512,"end":1770549102089,"firstResponse":31577,"sessionCreation":0,"total":31577},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

{"id":"websearch-1470","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026\nBased on the search results, here's a comprehensive answer on **how to handle React onClick interactions for checkbox labels and inputs in 2026**:\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices for React Checkbox onClick Handling in 2026\n\n### 1. **Use `onChange` Instead of `onClick`**\nThe recommended approach is to use `onChange` rather than `onClick` for checkbox inputs:\n\n```jsx\nconst Checkbox = ({ checked, onChange, label }) => {\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        checked={checked}\n        onChange={() => onChange(!checked)}\n      />\n      {label}\n    </label>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n**Why?** `onChange` better handles:\n- Screen reader interactions\n- Keyboard navigation\n- All toggle scenarios beyond just mouse clicks\n\n### 2. **Wrap Input in Label for Clickable Labels**\nAlways wrap your checkbox input inside a `<label>` element to make the entire label clickable:\n\n```jsx\n<label>\n  <input\n    type=\"checkbox\"\n    checked={checked}\n    onChange={handleChange}\n  />\n  Checkbox Label\n</label>\n```\n\nOr use the `htmlFor` attribute to associate labels:\n\n```jsx\n<label htmlFor=\"my-checkbox\">Accept Terms</label>\n<input\n  type=\"checkbox\"\n  id=\"my-checkbox\"\n  checked={checked}\n  onChange={handleChange}\n/>\n```\n\n### 3. **Controlled Component Pattern (Recommended)**\nUse the controlled component pattern with `useState`:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nconst CheckboxExample = () => {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleChange = () => {\n    setIsChecked(!isChecked);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        checked={isChecked}\n        onChange={handleChange}\n      />\n      My Checkbox\n    </label>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### 4. **Multiple Checkboxes Pattern**\n\n```jsx\nconst [checkboxes, setCheckboxes] = useState({\n  option1: false,\n  option2: false,\n  option3: false,\n});\n\nconst handleCheckboxChange = (event) => {\n  const { name, checked } = event.target;\n  setCheckboxes({ ...checkboxes, [name]: checked });\n};\n\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <label>\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        name=\"option1\"\n        checked={checkboxes.option1}\n        onChange={handleCheckboxChange}\n      />\n      Option 1\n    </label>\n    {/* ... more checkboxes */}\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\n### 5. **Custom Checkbox with Full Accessibility (2026 Standard)**\n\n```jsx\nconst CustomCheckbox = ({ checked, onChange, label, ariaLabel }) => {\n  const handleKeyPress = (event) => {\n    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {\n      onChange();\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      role=\"checkbox\"\n      aria-checked={checked}\n      onClick={onChange}\n      onKeyDown={handleKeyPress}\n      tabIndex=\"0\"\n      aria-label={ariaLabel}\n      style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}\n    >\n      <input\n        type=\"checkbox\"\n        checked={checked}\n        onChange={onChange}\n      />\n      {label}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways for 2026:\n\n| Practice | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Event Handler | Use `onChange`, not `onClick` |\n| Labels | Make entire label clickable via wrapping or `htmlFor` |\n| State Management | Use controlled components with `useState` |\n| Accessibility | Include `aria-checked`, `tabIndex`, keyboard handlers |\n| Label Association | Prefer `htmlFor`/`id` over `aria-label` for visual labels |\n\nThe **standard pattern** in React 2026 emphasizes accessibility-first design with proper label associations and keyboard support, while using `onChange` as the primary event handler for all checkbox interactions.","hint":"A strong answer should explain that in modern React you normally handle checkbox interaction with a controlled component using the `checked` prop and `onChange` (not `onClick`) on the `<input type=\"checkbox\">`, and use a `<label>` correctly associated via `htmlFor`/`id` (or wrapping the input) so clicks on the label toggle the checkbox while preserving keyboard and screen‑reader accessibility.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to handle React onClick interaction for checkbox labels and inputs in

=> {\n    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {\n      onChange();\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      role=\"checkbox\"\n      aria-checked={checked}\n      onClick={onChange}\n

  onChange={onChange}\n      />\n      {label}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways for 2026:\n\n| Practice | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Event Handler | Use `onChange`, not `onClick` |\n| Labels | Make entire label clickable via wrapping or `htmlFor` |\n| State Management | Use controlled components with `useState` |\n| Accessibility | Include `aria-checked`, `tabIndex`, keyboard handlers |\n| Label Association | Prefer `htmlFor`/`id` over `aria-label` for visual labels |\n\nThe **standard pattern** in React 2026 emphasizes accessibility-first design with proper label associations and keyboard support, while using `onChange` as the primary event handler for all checkbox interactions.","timestamp":21541}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"React_Forms","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770549446760,"end":1770549468301,"firstResponse":21541,"sessionCreation":1,"total":21541},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.85,"reasoning":"Deterministic:

It's a shellcode injection method that provides stealth by making malicious code appear to reside within a legitimate, memory-backed DLL.\n\n## How It Works (Step-by-Step)\n\n### 1. **Load a \"Decoy\" DLL into the Target Process**\nThe attacker uses `LoadLibraryEx` (instead of `LoadLibrary`) with the flag `DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES`:\n\n```c\nHMODULE hModule = LoadLibraryEx(dll_path, NULL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES);\n```\n\nThis flag is critical because:\n- It loads the DLL into memory **without calling DllMain**\n- It prevents `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`, `DLL_THREAD_ATTACH`, and `DLL_THREAD_DETACH` from firing\n- This avoids the shellcode executing multiple times when threads are created/destroyed\n\n### 2. **Locate the DLL's Entry Point**\nAfter loading, the attacker parses the PE headers to find the `AddressOfEntryPoint`:\n\n```c\nIMAGE_DOS_HEADER* dosHeader = (IMAGE_DOS_HEADER*)hModule;\nIMAGE_NT_HEADERS* ntHeaders = (IMAGE_NT_HEADERS*)((DWORD_PTR)hModule + dosHeader->e_lfanew);\nLPVOID entryPoint = (LPVOID)((DWORD_PTR)hModule + ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint);\n```\n\n### 3. **Change Memory Protections**\nThe `.text` section (where the entry point resides) is normally read-execute (RX). The attacker changes it to read-write-execute (RWX) or read-write (RW):\n\n```c\nVirtualProtect(entryPoint, shellcodeSize, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldProtect);\n```\n\n### 4. **Overwrite the Entry Point with Shellcode**\nThe legitimate DLL code is \"hollowed out\" and replaced with malicious shellcode:\n\n```c\nmemcpy(entryPoint, shellcode, shellcodeSize);\n```\n\n### 5. **Restore Memory Protections**\nTo reduce detection, restore to RX:\n\n```c\nVirtualProtect(entryPoint, shellcodeSize, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &oldProtect);\n```\n\n### 6. **Execute the Shellcode**\nFor local injection, a simple function pointer cast:\n```c\n((void(*)())entryPoint)();\n```\n\nFor remote injection, use `CreateRemoteThread` pointing to the hollowed entry point.\n\n## Why This Technique Is Stealthy\n\n| Traditional Injection | DLL Hollowing |\n|----------------------|---------------|\n| Memory marked as `MEM_PRIVATE` (suspicious) | Memory marked as `MEM_IMAGE` (legitimate) |\n| Unbacked memory (not associated with a file) | Backed by a real DLL on disk |\n| Easily detected by memory scanners | Blends with legitimate loaded modules |\n\n## 2024 Evasion Enhancements\n\n### **Phantom DLL Hollowing (TxF variant)**\nUses Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) to create a \"phantom\" file handle that isn't fully committed to disk:\n1. Create a transaction with `NtCreateTransaction`\n2. Open a DLL file transacted\n3. Create a section from this phantom file\n4. The resulting mapped memory has no queryable backing file\n\n### **CFG (Control Flow Guard) Bypass**\nModern Windows has CFG that validates call targets. Techniques to bypass:\n- **Thread Context Manipulation**: Create a suspended thread, modify `RIP` to point to shellcode, then resume\n- **Patching NTDLL**: Overwrite CFG check functions in ntdll.dll\n\n### **Avoiding PEB Detection**\nAdd the hollowed DLL to the PEB's loaded modules lists (InLoadOrderModuleList, InMemoryOrderModuleList, InInitializationOrderModuleList) to avoid detection by tools that compare PEB entries against memory regions.\n\n## Detection Methods\n\n- **Memory forensics tools** like Moneta, hollows_hunter, or Volatility's Hollowfind compare DLL contents on disk vs. in memory\n- **PE header comparison**: The hollowed region won't match the original DLL's headers\n- **Section permission mismatches**: Unexpected RWX or modified permissions on image sections\n- **Missing PEB entries**: Mapped image without corresponding PEB module entry\n\n## Key Malware Using This Technique (2024)\n\n- **HijackLoader/IDAT Loader**: Loads legitimate DLLs like `pla.dll`, `d3d9.dll`, then hollows them\n- **Lumma Stealer**\n- **Cobalt Strike beacons** (via artifact kit)\n- **State-sponsored APTs** (DPRK groups observed using phantom DLL hollowing)","hint":"A good answer must explain that this is a decoy DLL / DLL hollowing or module-stomping style injection that uses LoadLibraryEx to load a benign DLL into a remote or current process, then overwrites or “hollows out” the loaded image’s code (e.g., at its entry point) in memory with malicious payload, and finally transfers execution to that payload to evade detection. It should mention the relationship to process hollowing/memory hollowing techniques (legitimate container process or module, unmapping/overwriting sections, and executing attacker code from that disguised region) and, if referencing 2024, note that it is a contemporary variant/usage rather than a deprecated or purely historical method.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow does LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection work in 2024","timestamp":49123},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":49123},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014yGxk8nCpN9dcpyUmxCeKg","status":"completed","timestamp":49123},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Apdy3fsUifNJLrEsKkq4c7","status":"completed","timestamp":49123},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CyeyLKPeqV2dHJbv7rQmks","status":"completed","timestamp":49123},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01CJUEjzCqnS42G49de3yAYX","status":"completed","timestamp":49123},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":49123},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XWPFA3MnRvQfRPsroYw8Hn","status":"completed","timestamp":49123},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive research, here's how **LoadLibraryEx decoy DLL memory hollowing process injection** works in 2024:\n\n## Overview\n\nThis technique is also known as **Module Stomping**, **Module Overloading**, or **DLL Hollowing**.

This is because:\n\n1. **Breaking change in SQLAlchemy 2.0**: Starting with SQLAlchemy 2.0, passing raw strings to `connection.execute()` or `session.execute()` is **no longer supported**. This was deprecated in SQLAlchemy 1.4 and completely removed in 2.0.\n\n2. **Technical reason**: When you pass a plain string like `\"SELECT * FROM users\"`, SQLAlchemy tries to call `statement._execute_on_connection`, but a plain string doesn't have this method, resulting in:\n   ```\n   AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '_execute_on_connection'\n   ```\n   This then raises:\n   ```\n   sqlalchemy.exc.ObjectNotExecutableError: Not an executable object: 'SELECT * FROM users'\n   ```\n\n## How to Fix It with `text()` Wrapper\n\nThe solution is to wrap your raw SQL strings with `sqlalchemy.text()`:\n\n### Before (Broken in SQLAlchemy 2.x):\n```python\n# This will raise ObjectNotExecutableError\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(\"SELECT id, name FROM users\")\n```\n\n### After (Correct for SQLAlchemy 2.x):\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(text(\"SELECT id, name FROM users\"))\n```\n\n### With Parameters (Using Named Placeholders):\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    query = text(\"SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE category = :category\")\n    result = conn.execute(query, {\"category\": \"Electronics\"})\n```\n\n### For Async Engines:\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nasync with async_engine.connect() as conn:\n    query = text(\"SELECT id, name FROM items LIMIT 50\")\n    result = await conn.execute(query)\n```\n\n### With Pandas `read_sql`:\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text, create_engine\nimport pandas as pd\n\nengine = create_engine(\"mysql://user:pass@host/db\")\nquery = text(\"SELECT * FROM my_table\")\n\n# Pass the text() wrapped query\ndf = pd.read_sql(query, engine)\n```\n\n## Key Points for 2026\n\n1. **Always use `text()`**: In SQLAlchemy 2.x (current stable version 2.0.46 as of January 2026), you must always wrap raw SQL strings with `text()`.\n\n2. **Use named parameters**: Instead of string formatting or f-strings (which are SQL injection risks), use `:parameter_name` syntax with `text()`.\n\n3. **This applies everywhere**: Whether you're using synchronous or async engines, Flask-SQLAlchemy, pandas `read_sql`, or any other tool that uses SQLAlchemy under the hood.","hint":"A good answer must explain that in SQLAlchemy 2.x `ObjectNotExecutableError` occurs because passing a plain SQL string to `Connection.execute()` (or similar) is no longer allowed, as `execute()` now requires an executable construct rather than a bare `str`, and that the fix is to wrap raw SQL in `sqlalchemy.text()` (e.g., `conn.execute(text(\"SELECT ...\"))`) or otherwise use the 2.x-style execution API.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat causes ObjectNotExecutableError in SQLAlchemy 2.x when executing raw SQL and how to fix it with text() wrapper in 2026?","timestamp":19393},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":19393},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019ZeQghvRDjpmVkWsLkWS4W","status":"completed","timestamp":19393},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I can provide you with a comprehensive answer about the `ObjectNotExecutableError` in SQLAlchemy 2.x.\n\n## What Causes `ObjectNotExecutableError` in SQLAlchemy 2.x\n\nThe `ObjectNotExecutableError` occurs when you try to execute a **raw SQL string** directly with SQLAlchemy 2.x.

{"id":"websearch-1710","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix raw mode is not supported error in Ink CLI 2026","output":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix raw mode is not supported error in Ink CLI 2026\nBased on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about how to fix the \"Raw mode is not supported\" error in Ink CLI.\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix \"Raw Mode is Not Supported\" Error in Ink CLI (2026)\n\nThis error occurs when Ink (a React-based CLI framework) tries to enable raw mode on stdin, but the environment doesn't support it. This typically happens in **non-TTY environments** like:\n- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)\n- When piping input to the command\n- Docker containers without proper TTY allocation\n- Background processes\n\n### Solutions\n\n#### 1. **Check if Raw Mode is Supported Before Rendering**\nUse the `isRawModeSupported` check exported from Ink:\n\n```javascript\nimport {render, isRawModeSupported} from 'ink';\n\nif (isRawModeSupported) {\n  // Safe to use interactive Ink features\n  render(<App />);\n} else {\n  // Fall back to non-interactive output\n  console.log('Running in non-interactive mode');\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. **For CLI Tools That Need Non-Interactive Mode**\nIf you're building a CLI that must work in CI/CD, provide a \"print\" or \"non-interactive\" mode:\n\n```javascript\n// For tools like Claude Code CLI, use flags like:\nclaude -p \"your prompt\" --print  // Use print mode in CI\n```\n\n#### 3. **Use the `stdin` Option with a Custom Stream**\nWhen rendering, you can provide a custom stdin that supports raw mode, or disable stdin entirely:\n\n```javascript\nimport {render} from 'ink';\n\n// Option 1: Disable stdin entirely\nconst {unmount} = render(<App />, {\n  stdin: undefined,  // or pass a custom readable stream\n});\n\n// Option 2: Check TTY before interactive features\nif (process.stdin.isTTY) {\n  render(<InteractiveApp />);\n} else {\n  render(<NonInteractiveApp />);\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **For CI/CD Environments (GitHub Actions, etc.)**\nAdd proper TTY allocation or use non-interactive flags:\n\n```yaml\n# In GitHub Actions workflow\n- name: Run CLI\n  run: |\n    # Either use non-interactive mode\n    my-cli --non-interactive\n    \n    # Or allocate a pseudo-TTY (may not work in all CI environments)\n    script -q -c \"my-cli\" /dev/null\n```\n\n#### 5. **Conditional useInput Hook Usage**\nIf using `useInput` hook, wrap it with the raw mode check:\n\n```javascript\nimport {useInput, isRawModeSupported} from 'ink';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  // Only use input handling when raw mode is supported\n  if (isRawModeSupported) {\n    useInput((input, key) => {\n      // Handle input\n    });\n  }\n  \n  return <Text>My Component</Text>;\n};\n```\n\n#### 6. **Docker Containers**\nWhen running in Docker, ensure you allocate a TTY:\n\n```bash\n# Use -t flag to allocate pseudo-TTY\ndocker run -it my-image my-cli-command\n\n# Or use -t alone for TTY without interactive stdin\ndocker run -t my-image my-cli-command\n```\n\n### Root Cause Summary\n\nThe error happens because:\n1. Ink uses **raw mode** for interactive terminal features (keypresses, cursor control)\n2. Raw mode requires a **TTY** (terminal) connection\n3. When stdin comes from a pipe or non-TTY source, `setRawMode()` fails\n\nAlways check `process.stdin.isTTY` or use Ink's `isRawModeSupported` before attempting interactive terminal operations.","hint":"A good answer must explain that this Ink CLI error happens because “raw mode” input requires a real TTY (interactive terminal) and fails in non‑TTY contexts (like CI, pipes, or unsupported terminals), and should describe practical fixes such as running the command in a proper terminal, disabling or conditionally enabling raw mode (e.g., checking `process.stdin.isTTY` before `setRawMode`), or falling back to a non‑interactive mode when raw mode isn’t supported.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nhow to fix raw mode is not supported error in Ink CLI 2026","timestamp":29407},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":29407},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Kxb9czFJtgM3CLdXhdFyq7","status":"completed","timestamp":29407},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":29407},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01JuBiDZ4h3BJitKvjM9Vpa8","status":"completed","timestamp":29407},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about how to fix the \"Raw mode is not supported\" error in Ink CLI.\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix \"Raw Mode is Not Supported\" Error in Ink CLI (2026)\n\nThis error occurs when Ink (a React-based CLI framework) tries to enable raw mode on stdin, but the environment doesn't support it.

Attackers use rotating residential proxies that cycle through real consumer IP addresses (average visibility of just 4.56 days per IP), making traditional IP reputation systems perpetually stale. Research shows that over 550 threat groups use residential proxy exit nodes to obfuscate malicious activity.\n\n### Multi-Layered Detection Approach\n\n**1. Advanced IP Intelligence & Reputation Scoring**\n- Deploy real-time IP reputation APIs that classify IPs as datacenter, residential, VPN, or proxy\n- Use services that track 100+ residential proxy providers directly (like IPinfo's verification-based detection)\n- Implement tiered risk scoring (Low/Medium/High/Extreme) based on:\n  - ASN analysis (datacenter vs residential)\n  - Previous abuse reports\n  - Request velocity patterns\n  - IPv6 address persistence analysis\n\n**2. Device & Browser Fingerprinting**\n- Analyze browser configurations: Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, Navigator properties\n- Track screen resolution, plugins, timezone, and language settings\n- Detect inconsistencies between fingerprint and reported location/OS\n- Flag when IPs rotate but device fingerprints remain identical (strong bot indicator)\n\n**3. Behavioral Analysis & Anomaly Detection**\n- Monitor session traversal paths and request sequences\n- Track mouse movements, typing cadence, scrolling patterns, and time-to-complete actions\n- Use AI-driven per-customer baseline models (as Cloudflare implements)\n- Analyze interaction patterns with dynamic page elements\n- Detect automation markers through behavioral fingerprinting\n\n**4. TLS/JA4 Fingerprinting**\n- Analyze TLS handshake characteristics unique to automation tools\n- Track JA4 fingerprints across customer traffic baselines\n- Detect curl_cffi, Nodriver, and other anti-detect tools through protocol-level signatures\n\n### Prevention Strategies\n\n**1. Layered Rate Limiting**\n- Implement exponential backoff for suspicious patterns\n- Apply different limits per IP, session, fingerprint, and behavioral profile\n- Cool down flagged IPs/profiles for 15-60 minutes after detection\n\n**2. Challenge-Response Systems**\n- Deploy CAPTCHAs strategically (not just IP-based)\n- Use proof-of-work challenges for suspicious sessions\n- Implement invisible challenges that bots cannot easily solve\n\n**3. Session & Cookie Management**\n- Track session state across distributed requests\n- Detect cookie anomalies and stolen session tokens\n- Require re-authentication for behavioral anomalies\n\n**4. Geographic Consistency Checks**\n- Verify proxy location matches expected regional behavior\n- Flag mismatches between timezone, language, and IP geolocation\n- Monitor for impossible travel patterns across sessions\n\n**5. API Protection**\n- Protect both web and mobile API endpoints (mobile APIs often have lighter protection)\n- Implement API-specific rate limiting and authentication\n- Monitor for reverse-engineered mobile app API abuse\n\n### E-Commerce-Specific Recommendations (Shopee-like platforms)\n\n1. **Multi-account detection**: Use fingerprinting to link accounts operating from rotating proxies\n2. **Checkout protection**: Apply stricter behavioral analysis at payment gateways\n3. **Inventory abuse prevention**: Detect bots attempting flash sale exploitation\n4. **Ad fraud prevention**: Validate that traffic conversions match human behavioral patterns\n5. **Trust mobile but verify**: Mobile environments get trust bias - implement mobile-specific behavioral checks\n\n### Key 2026 Technology Partners\n- **Bot Management**: Cloudflare, DataDome, Akamai, Imperva, HUMAN Security\n- **IP Intelligence**: IPinfo, Fraudlogix, Spur, Scamalytics\n- **Behavioral Analysis**: Netacea, Arkose Labs\n- **API Security**: Cequence, Fastly\n\nThe critical insight for 2026: **No single technique works alone**. Modern anti-bot systems must combine AI-powered behavioral analysis, TLS fingerprinting, device fingerprinting, IP reputation, and contextual signals into unified defense layers. Simple IP rotation detection is obsolete—platforms need multi-layered approaches that address every detection vector simultaneously.","hint":"Answer must (1) explain what proxy rotation attacks are in the e‑commerce context (bots or fraudsters using fast‑changing IPs/residential proxies/VPNs to evade IP‑based rate limits, detection, and blocks), and (2) describe concrete 2026‑appropriate detection and prevention measures beyond simple IP blocking—e.g., device/browser fingerprinting, behavioral/velocity analysis, account‑level and session‑level anomaly detection, ML‑based bot management, stricter authentication/step‑up verification, and WAF/CDN or specialized bot‑mitigation services applicable to large marketplaces like Shopee.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","timestamp":35485},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":35485},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01F8ZkooFa9hwJXicPm7Hij8","status":"completed","timestamp":35485},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014QNAg9NmeDH7jx1gqDL8cH","status":"completed","timestamp":35485},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01NNfvh2D9fzt51VMKX2CpK5","status":"completed","timestamp":35485},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SYyC5QoAPfLcj7E82LjSJc","status":"completed","timestamp":35485},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive answer on how to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026:\n\n## How to Detect and Prevent Proxy Rotation Attacks in E-Commerce Platforms (2026)\n\n### Understanding the Threat Landscape\n\nProxy rotation attacks have become increasingly sophisticated in 2026.

Advanced IP Intelligence & Reputation Scoring**\n- Deploy real-time IP reputation APIs that classify IPs as datacenter, residential, VPN, or proxy\n- Use services that track 100+ residential proxy providers directly (like IPinfo's verification-based detection)\n- Implement tiered risk scoring (Low/Medium/High/Extreme) based on:\n  - ASN analysis (datacenter vs residential)\n  - Previous abuse reports\n  - Request velocity patterns\n  - IPv6 address persistence analysis\n\n**2. Device & Browser Fingerprinting**\n- Analyze browser configurations: Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, Navigator properties\n- Track screen resolution, plugins, timezone, and language settings\n- Detect inconsistencies between fingerprint and reported location/OS\n- Flag when IPs rotate but device fingerprints remain identical (strong bot indicator)\n\n**3. Behavioral Analysis & Anomaly Detection**\n- Monitor session traversal paths and request sequences\n- Track mouse movements, typing cadence, scrolling patterns, and time-to-complete actions\n- Use AI-driven per-customer baseline models (as Cloudflare implements)\n- Analyze interaction patterns with dynamic page elements\n- Detect automation markers through behavioral fingerprinting\n\n**4. TLS/JA4 Fingerprinting**\n- Analyze TLS handshake characteristics unique to automation tools\n- Track JA4 fingerprints across customer traffic baselines\n- Detect curl_cffi, Nodriver, and other anti-detect tools through protocol-level signatures\n\n### Prevention Strategies\n\n**1. Layered Rate Limiting**\n- Implement exponential backoff for suspicious patterns\n- Apply different limits per IP, session, fingerprint, and behavioral profile\n- Cool down flagged IPs/profiles for 15-60 minutes after detection\n\n**2. Challenge-Response Systems**\n- Deploy CAPTCHAs strategically (not just IP-based)\n- Use proof-of-work challenges for suspicious sessions\n- Implement invisible challenges that bots cannot easily solve\n\n**3. Session & Cookie Management**\n- Track session state across distributed requests\n- Detect cookie anomalies and stolen session tokens\n- Require re-authentication for behavioral anomalies\n\n**4. Geographic Consistency Checks**\n- Verify proxy location matches expected regional behavior\n- Flag mismatches between timezone, language, and IP geolocation\n- Monitor for impossible travel patterns across sessions\n\n**5. API Protection**\n- Protect both web and mobile API endpoints (mobile APIs often have lighter protection)\n- Implement API-specific rate limiting and authentication\n- Monitor for reverse-engineered mobile app API abuse\n\n### E-Commerce-Specific Recommendations (Shopee-like platforms)\n\n1. **Multi-account detection**: Use fingerprinting to link accounts operating from rotating proxies\n2. **Checkout protection**: Apply stricter behavioral analysis at payment gateways\n3. **Inventory abuse prevention**: Detect bots attempting flash sale exploitation\n4. **Ad fraud prevention**: Validate that traffic conversions match human behavioral patterns\n5. **Trust mobile but verify**: Mobile environments get trust bias - implement mobile-specific behavioral checks\n\n### Key 2026 Technology Partners\n- **Bot Management**: Cloudflare, DataDome, Akamai, Imperva, HUMAN Security\n- **IP Intelligence**: IPinfo, Fraudlogix, Spur, Scamalytics\n- **Behavioral Analysis**: Netacea, Arkose Labs\n- **API Security**: Cequence, Fastly\n\nThe critical insight for 2026: **No single technique works alone**. Modern anti-bot systems must combine AI-powered behavioral analysis, TLS fingerprinting, device fingerprinting, IP reputation, and contextual signals into unified defense layers. Simple IP rotation detection is obsolete—platforms need multi-layered approaches that address every detection vector simultaneously.","timestamp":35485}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Security","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770550296268,"end":1770550331753,"firstResponse":35485,"sessionCreation":0,"total":35485},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.88,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=0).

Understanding Tailwind's Mobile-First Approach\n\nTailwind CSS is **mobile-first by default**. This means:\n- Unprefixed utilities (like `bg-primary-500`) apply to **all screen sizes**\n- Prefixed utilities (like `md:bg-primary-700`) apply at the specified breakpoint **and above**\n\n### 2. Adding Custom Colors\n\n#### **Tailwind v4 (CSS-First Approach)**\n\nIn Tailwind v4, colors are defined using the `@theme` directive in your CSS file:\n\n```css\n/* app.css */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  /* Brand primary color scale using OKLCH */\n  --color-primary-50: oklch(98.3% 0.02 250);\n  --color-primary-100: oklch(95.1% 0.03 250);\n  --color-primary-500: oklch(68% 0.1 250);\n  --color-primary-900: oklch(30% 0.15 250);\n  \n  /* Single accent color */\n  --color-accent: #FF5A1F;\n  \n  /* Semantic colors */\n  --color-surface: #FFFFFF;\n  --color-content: #111827;\n}\n```\n\n#### **Tailwind v3 (Config-Based Approach)**\n\nIn Tailwind v3, add colors in `tailwind.config.js`:\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nexport default {\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        'primary': {\n          50: '#f0f9ff',\n          100: '#e0f2fe',\n          500: '#0ea5e9',\n          700: '#0369a1',\n          900: '#0c4a6e',\n        },\n        'accent': '#FF5A1F',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Using Custom Colors in Mobile-First Responsive Design\n\nOnce defined, use your custom colors with responsive prefixes:\n\n```html\n<!-- Mobile-first: starts with mobile styles, then adds tablet/desktop overrides -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-500 md:bg-primary-600 lg:bg-primary-700 text-white\">\n  Click Me\n</button>\n\n<div class=\"bg-surface text-content p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8\">\n  Content area\n</div>\n```\n\n### 4. Dark Mode Theming (v4)\n\n```css\n/* Light mode (default) */\n@theme {\n  --color-surface: #FFFFFF;\n  --color-content: #111827;\n}\n\n/* Dark mode */\nhtml.dark @theme {\n  --color-surface: #1F2937;\n  --color-content: #F9FAFB;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Disabling Default Colors (Slim Builds)\n\nTo use only your custom palette and reduce bundle size:\n\n```css\n@tailwind base;\n@theme {\n  --disable-default-colors: true;\n  \n  /* Your custom palette only */\n  --color-brand-50: #F5F5FA;\n  --color-brand-500: #3B82F6;\n  --color-brand-900: #0D0D3B;\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Key Tips\n\n| Tip | Description |\n|-----|-------------|\n| **Use semantic names** | `--color-surface`, `--color-content` for theming |\n| **OKLCH for v4** | Tailwind v4 uses perceptually even OKLCH color space |\n| **Mobile-first always** | Write base styles first, add responsive modifiers for larger screens |\n| **Arbitrary values** | Use `bg-[#32CD32]` for one-off colors |\n\n### 7.

Let me summarize how to use the Rust libp2p relay client behaviour to dial through a relay.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use the Rust libp2p Relay Client Behaviour to Dial Through a Relay (2026)\n\n### Overview\n\nIn rust-libp2p (current version 0.21.x for libp2p-relay), you use the **relay client behaviour** (`libp2p_relay::client::Behaviour`) to establish connections through relay servers using the **Circuit Relay v2 protocol**.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Swarm with Relay Client\n\nThe modern approach uses `SwarmBuilder` with the `with_relay_client()` method:\n\n```rust\nuse libp2p::{\n    core::multiaddr::{Multiaddr, Protocol},\n    dcutr, identify, identity, noise, ping, relay,\n    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, SwarmEvent},\n    tcp, yamux, PeerId,\n};\n\n#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]\nstruct Behaviour {\n    relay_client: relay::client::Behaviour,\n    ping: ping::Behaviour,\n    identify: identify::Behaviour,\n    dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour,  // Optional: for hole punching\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let mut swarm = libp2p::SwarmBuilder::with_new_identity()\n        .with_tokio()\n        .with_tcp(\n            tcp::Config::default().nodelay(true),\n            noise::Config::new,\n            yamux::Config::default,\n        )?\n        .with_quic()\n        .with_dns()?\n        .with_relay_client(noise::Config::new, yamux::Config::default)?\n        .with_behaviour(|keypair, relay_behaviour| Behaviour {\n            relay_client: relay_behaviour,\n            ping: ping::Behaviour::new(ping::Config::new()),\n            identify: identify::Behaviour::new(identify::Config::new(\n                \"/my-app/1.0.0\".to_string(),\n                keypair.public(),\n            )),\n            dcutr: dcutr::Behaviour::new(keypair.public().to_peer_id()),\n        })?\n        .build();\n    \n    // ... rest of the code\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Connect to the Relay Server First\n\nBefore dialing through a relay, you must establish a connection to the relay server:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_address: Multiaddr = \"/ip4/RELAY_IP/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID\".parse()?;\n\n// Dial the relay server directly\nswarm.dial(relay_address.clone())?;\n\n// Wait for connection and identify exchange\n// This helps learn your observed (public) address\n```\n\n### Step 3: Dial a Peer Through the Relay\n\nTo dial a peer through the relay, construct a **`/p2p-circuit` address**:\n\n```rust\nlet relay_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse()?;\nlet destination_peer_id: PeerId = \"12D3KooW...\".parse()?;\n\n// Construct the relayed address\nlet relayed_addr = relay_address\n    .with(Protocol::P2pCircuit)              // Signal to use relay\n    .with(Protocol::P2p(destination_peer_id)); // Target peer\n\n// Dial through the relay\nswarm.dial(relayed_addr)?;\n```\n\nThe address format is:\n```\n/ip4/<RELAY_IP>/tcp/<PORT>/p2p/<RELAY_PEER_ID>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<DESTINATION_PEER_ID>\n```\n\n### Step 4: Listen for Incoming Relayed Connections (Optional)\n\nIf you want to receive connections via a relay (useful behind NAT):\n\n```rust\n// Make a reservation on the relay to accept inbound connections\nlet listen_addr = relay_address.with(Protocol::P2pCircuit);\nswarm.listen_on(listen_addr)?;\n```\n\n### Step 5: Handle Relay Events\n\n```rust\nloop {\n    match swarm.next().await.unwrap() {\n        SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::RelayClient(\n            relay::client::Event::ReservationReqAccepted { .. },\n        )) => {\n            println!(\"Relay accepted our reservation!\");\n        }\n        SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished { peer_id, endpoint, .. } => {\n            println!(\"Connected to {} via {:?}\", peer_id, endpoint);\n        }\n        SwarmEvent::Behaviour(BehaviourEvent::RelayClient(event)) => {\n            println!(\"Relay event: {:?}\", event);\n        }\n        _ => {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Use `SwarmBuilder::with_relay_client()`** - This automatically sets up both the `relay::client::Behaviour` and the relay transport.\n\n2. **Address format for dialing through relay**:\n   - `<relay-multiaddr>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<destination-peer-id>`\n\n3. **Address format for listening via relay**:\n   - `<relay-multiaddr>/p2p-circuit`\n\n4. **The relay client behaviour handles**:\n   - Making reservations on relays\n   - Establishing relayed connections (outbound)\n   - Accepting relayed connections (inbound)\n\n5. **Consider using DCUtR** (`libp2p-dcutr`) alongside the relay for hole punching, which can upgrade relayed connections to direct connections when possible.\n\n### Cargo Dependencies\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlibp2p = { version = \"0.55\", features = [\"relay\", \"dcutr\", \"tcp\", \"quic\", \"dns\", \"noise\", \"yamux\", \"identify\", \"ping\", \"tokio\"] }\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\n```","hint":"A correct answer must describe how to use the current (latest) Rust libp2p relay client components—specifically the `libp2p::relay::client` behaviour and its associated client transport/connection types—to dial a remote peer via a relay, including constructing a `Swarm` with the relay client behaviour, wrapping the base `Transport` with the relay client transport, and dialing a peer using a relayed multiaddr (e.g., including the relay and `/p2p-circuit` segments) rather than a direct address.

It aggregates payment channels like WeChat Pay (微信支付), Alipay (支付宝), QQ Wallet, and bank cards, providing a unified API interface for merchants.\n\n---\n\n### Integration with New-API\n\nNew-API (an enhanced fork of one-api by QuantumNous) has **built-in support for EPay/YiPay**. Here's how to configure it:\n\n#### Step 1: Required Configuration Parameters\n\nIn your New-API admin panel, go to **System Settings → Payment Settings** and configure:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **API Base URL** | Your EPay provider's API endpoint (e.g., `https://pay.example.com`) |\n| **Merchant ID (PID)** | Your merchant ID from the EPay platform |\n| **Merchant Key (KEY)** | Your secret key for signature verification |\n\n#### Step 2: Configure Payment Methods Template\n\nSet up your \"Recharge Methods\" in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"自定义支付\",\n    \"color\": \"black\",\n    \"type\": \"custom1\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"50\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Field Reference:**\n- `name`: Display label on the payment button\n- `color`: Button theme color (CSS color value)\n- `type`: Channel identifier (`alipay`, `wxpay`, `qqpay`, etc.)\n- `min_topup`: Minimum allowed amount (optional)\n\n#### Step 3: Set Callback/Webhook URL\n\nConfigure the **notify_url** (callback URL) in your EPay platform to point to your New-API instance:\n```\nhttps://your-domain.com/api/checkout/providers/epay/webhook\n```\n\n---\n\n### Integration with Original One-API\n\nThe original one-api by songquanpeng has **limited built-in payment support**. For EPay integration, you may need to:\n\n1. Use a fork that supports EPay (like New-API)\n2. Or implement custom payment integration via environment variables\n\n---\n\n### Common Issues & Troubleshooting\n\n**Problem: Balance shows 0 after payment**\n\nThis is a common issue reported by users. Solutions:\n\n1. **Check Callback URL**: Ensure the EPay platform can reach your server's webhook endpoint\n2. **Verify Signature**: Make sure the Merchant Key matches exactly between EPay and New-API\n3. **Check Firewall**: Ensure your server allows incoming requests from the EPay platform\n4. **Local Testing**: For local development, use a tunnel service (like ngrok) since localhost can't receive external callbacks\n\n**Testing locally:**\n- Payment redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?param1=xxx&param2=yyy`\n- Manually test webhook: `http://localhost:3000/api/checkout/providers/epay/webhook?param1=xxx&param2=yyy`\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Payment Options (2026)\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| **EPay/YiPay** | Fast setup, instant account creation | Higher fees (~3%), ¥50 minimum withdrawal |\n| **Stripe** | International support, well-documented | Requires business verification |\n| **ZPAY** | Lower fees | Slower setup |\n| **V免签** | Free, self-hosted | Requires phone/device for monitoring |\n| **Jeepay** | Open-source, full-featured | More complex setup |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nFor **New-API** (recommended for 2026):\n1. Go to Admin Panel → System Settings → Payment Settings\n2. Fill in EPay API URL, PID, and KEY\n3. Configure payment methods JSON template\n4. Set the callback URL in your EPay provider\n5.

Here's how to configure it:\n\n#### Step 1: Required Configuration Parameters\n\nIn your New-API admin panel, go to **System Settings → Payment Settings** and configure:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **API Base URL** | Your EPay provider's API endpoint (e.g., `https://pay.example.com`) |\n| **Merchant ID (PID)** | Your merchant ID from the EPay platform |\n| **Merchant Key (KEY)** | Your secret key for signature verification |\n\n#### Step 2: Configure Payment Methods Template\n\nSet up your \"Recharge Methods\" in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-blue-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"支付宝\",\n    \"type\": \"alipay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": \"rgba(var(--semi-green-5), 1)\",\n    \"name\": \"微信\",\n    \"type\": \"wxpay\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"自定义支付\",\n    \"color\": \"black\",\n    \"type\": \"custom1\",\n    \"min_topup\": \"50\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Field Reference:**\n- `name`: Display label on the payment button\n- `color`: Button theme color (CSS color value)\n- `type`: Channel identifier (`alipay`, `wxpay`, `qqpay`, etc.)\n- `min_topup`: Minimum allowed amount (optional)\n\n#### Step 3: Set Callback/Webhook URL\n\nConfigure the **notify_url** (callback URL) in your EPay platform to point to your New-API instance:\n```\nhttps://your-domain.com/api/checkout/providers/epay/webhook\n```\n\n---\n\n### Integration with Original One-API\n\nThe original one-api by songquanpeng has **limited built-in payment support**. For EPay integration, you may need to:\n\n1. Use a fork that supports EPay (like New-API)\n2. Or implement custom payment integration via environment variables\n\n---\n\n### Common Issues & Troubleshooting\n\n**Problem: Balance shows 0 after payment**\n\nThis is a common issue reported by users. Solutions:\n\n1. **Check Callback URL**: Ensure the EPay platform can reach your server's webhook endpoint\n2. **Verify Signature**: Make sure the Merchant Key matches exactly between EPay and New-API\n3. **Check Firewall**: Ensure your server allows incoming requests from the EPay platform\n4. **Local Testing**: For local development, use a tunnel service (like ngrok) since localhost can't receive external callbacks\n\n**Testing locally:**\n- Payment redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?param1=xxx&param2=yyy`\n- Manually test webhook: `http://localhost:3000/api/checkout/providers/epay/webhook?param1=xxx&param2=yyy`\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Payment Options (2026)\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| **EPay/YiPay** | Fast setup, instant account creation | Higher fees (~3%), ¥50 minimum withdrawal |\n| **Stripe** | International support, well-documented | Requires business verification |\n| **ZPAY** | Lower fees | Slower setup |\n| **V免签** | Free, self-hosted | Requires phone/device for monitoring |\n| **Jeepay** | Open-source, full-featured | More complex setup |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nFor **New-API** (recommended for 2026):\n1. Go to Admin Panel → System Settings → Payment Settings\n2. Fill in EPay API URL, PID, and KEY\n3. Configure payment methods JSON template\n4. Set the callback URL in your EPay provider\n5. Save and test\n\nFor **original one-api**: Consider migrating to New-API which has native EPay support and is actively maintained.","timestamp":48991}],"metadata":{"category":"Product_Info","subcategory":"Payment_Service","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770550588890,"end":1770550637881,"firstResponse":48991,"sessionCreation":0,"total":48991},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.94,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

According to the current Packagist listing (as of late 2025/2026):\n\n### Current Version Compatibility\n\nThe latest version **v4.4.2** (released November 29, 2025) requires:\n```\n\"illuminate/support\": \"9.*|10.*|11.*|12.*\"\n```\n\nThis means it fully supports:\n- Laravel 9\n- Laravel 10\n- Laravel 11\n- Laravel 12\n\n### How to Fix Your Installation\n\n**Option 1: Upgrade the package**\n```bash\ncomposer update shetabit/visitor\n```\n\n**Option 2: Require the latest version explicitly**\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor:^4.4\n```\n\n**Option 3: If you're stuck on an older version**, check which version you have and remove any version constraints in your `composer.json`:\n```bash\ncomposer show shetabit/visitor\n```\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n1. **If you get version conflict errors**, make sure you don't have conflicting packages.

SSE to Streamable HTTP Transport Migration\n\n**Breaking Change:** SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport is being deprecated in favor of Streamable HTTP transport.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n```python\n# OLD (deprecated SSE-based approach)\nfrom livekit.agents.llm.mcp import MCPServerHTTP\n\nmcp_server = MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://example.com/sse\"  # SSE endpoint\n)\n\n# NEW (use explicit transport_type parameter)\nfrom livekit.agents.llm.mcp import MCPServerHTTP\n\n# Option 1: Explicitly set transport type\nmcp_server = MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://example.com/mcp\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\"  # Explicitly specify transport\n)\n\n# Option 2: For backward compatibility with SSE\nmcp_server = MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://example.com/sse\",\n    transport_type=\"sse\"  # Keep using SSE if needed\n)\n```\n\n### 2. URL-Based Auto-Detection\n\nThe framework now auto-detects transport type based on URL path:\n- URLs ending with `/sse` → use SSE transport\n- URLs ending with `/mcp` → use Streamable HTTP transport\n- Other URLs → default to SSE for backward compatibility\n\n**Fix:** Either use the correct URL suffix or explicitly set `transport_type`:\n\n```python\n# Auto-detection based on URL\nmcp_server = MCPServerHTTP(url=\"https://api.example.com/mcp\")  # Uses streamable HTTP\n\n# Or force a specific transport\nmcp_server = MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://api.example.com/custom-endpoint\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\"\n)\n```\n\n### 3. New `allowed_tools` Parameter (v1.3.11+)\n\nAdded in later versions for tool filtering:\n\n```python\nmcp_server = MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://example.com/mcp\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\",\n    allowed_tools=[\"tool1\", \"tool2\"]  # Filter available tools\n)\n```\n\n### 4. Agent-Level MCP Configuration Changes\n\n**OLD approach (v0.x):**\n```python\n# Old way - direct tool integration\nagent = VoiceAgent(tools=[...])\n```\n\n**NEW approach (v1.x+):**\n```python\nfrom livekit.agents import Agent\nfrom livekit.agents.llm.mcp import MCPServerHTTP, MCPServerStdio\n\n# HTTP-based MCP server\nhttp_mcp = MCPServerHTTP(\n    url=\"https://api.example.com/mcp\",\n    transport_type=\"streamable_http\"\n)\n\n# Stdio-based MCP server (for local tools)\nstdio_mcp = MCPServerStdio(\n    command=\"npx\",\n    args=[\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/path\"]\n)\n\n# Pass MCP servers to Agent\nagent = Agent(\n    instructions=\"Your agent instructions\",\n    mcp_servers=[http_mcp, stdio_mcp]\n)\n```\n\n### 5. Known Regression Fix (v1.2.7 → v1.2.8+)\n\nThere was a regression in v1.2.7 where the agent would fail to respond after MCP tool execution. **Fix:** Upgrade to v1.2.8 or later.\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade livekit-agents>=1.2.8\n```\n\n### Summary Migration Checklist\n\n1. **Update transport URLs** to end with `/mcp` for streamable HTTP or use explicit `transport_type`\n2. **Add `transport_type` parameter** if using non-standard URLs\n3. **Use `mcp_servers` parameter** on `Agent` instead of directly passing tools\n4. **Update to latest version** (1.3.12+) to avoid known regressions\n5. **Install MCP extra**: `pip install livekit-agents[mcp]`","hint":"A correct answer should identify that LiveKit Agents v1.2 introduced breaking changes to the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and must describe (a) what changed in the MCP client/server configuration or tool registration (e.g., how MCP servers are wired into `Agent` / `AgentSession`, changes to `function_tool` usage, `tools`/`update_tools()` behavior, or connection parameters) and (b) concrete migration steps or code adjustments (before/after or upgrade instructions) needed to restore a working MCP-based tools setup in 2025-era projects.[[1, 2, 3, 4]]","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to fix breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025?","timestamp":37178},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":37178},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01VHXYNhdwYqKCgDZb9TV7bn","status":"completed","timestamp":37178},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific information about v1.2 breaking changes:","timestamp":37178},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012WiDnwpKWnaEnxoXUaiKzt","status":"completed","timestamp":37178},{"type":"message","content":"Let me search for more specific v1.2 changelog and breaking changes:","timestamp":37178},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_012wpoSkKUaj6FJ4g5aSME6e","status":"completed","timestamp":37178},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-contents","status":"pending","timestamp":37178},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01WhBdu5LwRLfDD3sChmW1NK","status":"completed","timestamp":37178},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about fixing breaking changes in the LiveKit agents v1.2 MCP implementation from 2025.\n\n## How to Fix Breaking Changes in LiveKit Agents v1.2 MCP Implementation\n\n### Key Breaking Changes in v1.2\n\nThe LiveKit Agents v1.2 introduced significant MCP (Model Context Protocol) changes related to transport protocols:\n\n### 1.

Known Regression Fix (v1.2.7 → v1.2.8+)\n\nThere was a regression in v1.2.7 where the agent would fail to respond after MCP tool execution. **Fix:** Upgrade to v1.2.8 or later.\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade livekit-agents>=1.2.8\n```\n\n### Summary Migration Checklist\n\n1. **Update transport URLs** to end with `/mcp` for streamable HTTP or use explicit `transport_type`\n2. **Add `transport_type` parameter** if using non-standard URLs\n3. **Use `mcp_servers` parameter** on `Agent` instead of directly passing tools\n4. **Update to latest version** (1.3.12+) to avoid known regressions\n5. **Install MCP extra**: `pip install livekit-agents[mcp]`","timestamp":37178}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"LiveKit","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770551260643,"end":1770551297821,"firstResponse":37178,"sessionCreation":0,"total":37178},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.97,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Let me summarize what I found:\n\n## Summary: Research on GSE201705 and Single-Cell Lung Injury from Radiation and Immunotherapy\n\n### Important Clarification About GSE201705\n\n**GSE201705 is NOT related to lung injury from radiation and immunotherapy.** Based on my direct query to the NCBI GEO database, **GSE201705** is actually a dataset titled \"Single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of pattern formation in the early embryo of the spider *Parasteatoda tepidariorum*\" - it's a spider embryology study from 2022, not a lung injury dataset.\n\nIt appears there may be confusion with a different GEO accession number for lung injury research.\n\n---\n\n### Latest 2026 Research on Single-Cell Lung Injury from Radiation and Immunotherapy\n\nHere are the key findings from the most recent (2025-2026) research in this area:\n\n#### 1. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Pneumonitis (CIP) Single-Cell Studies**\n\nA landmark **Nature Communications** study published in **November 2025** (\"Uncovering the immune mechanisms underlying the emergence of immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis in lung cancer patients\") performed **single-cell analysis of CIP samples** from lung cancer patients and identified:\n- **IFNγ-producing CD8 Tissue-resident T cells** as central players\n- **IgG isotype class switching in B cells**\n- **GSDME-mediated macrophage pyroptosis** as a key mechanism\n\n#### 2. **Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) Single-Cell Research**\n\nKey 2024-2025 publications using scRNA-seq for RILI include:\n- A 2024 study in *Bosnian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences* performed scRNA-seq on rat lung tissues 2 weeks post-radiation (20 Gy) identifying altered cell populations and inflammatory markers\n- **September 2025**: \"Integrated Bulk and Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Identifies Oxidative...\" identified oxidative stress pathways as key biomarkers for early RILI diagnosis\n\n#### 3. **Combined Radiation + Immunotherapy Lung Toxicity**\n\n- **March 2025**: A comprehensive review in *Radiation Oncology* titled \"Radiation-induced lung injury: from mechanism to prognosis and pharmacotherapy\" synthesized current knowledge, noting that the combination of ICIs and radiotherapy creates an elevated risk of pneumonitis that is \"not a simple superposition\" of both toxicities\n- **2025-2026 research** highlights that single-cell approaches including scRNA-seq, mass cytometry, and patient-specific cell culture models are being used to develop better biomarkers for predicting pneumonitis risk\n\n#### 4. **Key 2026 Developments**\n\n- **January 2026** (*Frontiers in Immunology*): \"Lung cancer immunotherapy in 2025: where we stand and future prospects\" emphasizes that the PACIFIC trial's concern about pneumonitis remains an active research area, with optimal radiation dose/fractionation to maximize immunogenic synergy being investigated\n- **January 2026** (*Nature Cell Death Discovery*): New single-cell analysis identifying Sbno2-expressing tissue-resident alveolar macrophages as therapeutic targets for acute lung injury\n\n---\n\n### If You're Looking for a Specific Lung Injury Single-Cell Dataset\n\nThe correct GEO accessions for radiation/immunotherapy lung injury single-cell studies include datasets from:\n- Mouse radiation pneumonitis models (various accessions)\n- Human checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis patient samples\n- Studies examining combined radiation-immunotherapy toxicity\n\nI recommend searching NCBI GEO directly with terms like \"radiation lung injury single cell\" or \"checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis scRNA-seq\" to find the specific dataset you may be looking for.","hint":"A good answer must correctly identify GSE201705 as the GEO dataset for a single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq study of pattern formation in the early spider embryo (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), published in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology (2022).

Card-Based Layout for Each Room**\n- Display each room as an individual **expandable card** with:\n  - Room thumbnail image\n  - Room type and name\n  - Check-in/check-out dates\n  - Guest names assigned to each room\n  - Price breakdown per room\n- Cards allow users to quickly scan multiple rooms while keeping details organized\n\n### **2. Accordion/Collapsible Sections**\n- Use **accordion UI** to manage information density:\n  - Collapsed view: Room name, dates, total price\n  - Expanded view: Full amenities, bed configuration, cancellation policy, special requests\n- Reduces cognitive load while keeping all details accessible\n\n### **3. Clear Visual Hierarchy with Summary at Top**\n- **Booking summary header** showing:\n  - Confirmation number prominently displayed\n  - Hotel name and location\n  - Total number of rooms booked\n  - Overall stay dates\n  - Grand total price\n- Individual room details below the summary\n\n### **4. Status Indicators & Confirmation Badges**\n- Visual confirmation badges (✓ checkmarks, green indicators)\n- \"Booking Confirmed\" status prominently displayed\n- Show room readiness and early check-in options where applicable\n\n### **5. Generous White Space & Minimalist Design**\n- Clean typography with clear headings\n- Subtle dividers between room sections\n- Prioritize readability across devices\n- Avoid information overload—show essential details first\n\n### **6. Mobile-First Responsive Design**\n- Stackable room cards that work on all screen sizes\n- Touch-friendly expand/collapse interactions\n- Large tap targets for actions (modify, cancel, add to calendar)\n\n### **7. Actionable CTAs Per Room**\n- Each room card should include:\n  - \"Modify Room\" button\n  - \"Cancel Room\" option\n  - \"Add Guest Details\" link\n  - \"View Room Details\" expansion\n\n### **8. Price Transparency**\n- Per-room pricing clearly visible\n- Itemized breakdown (room rate, taxes, fees)\n- Running total prominently shown\n- Any discounts or promotions highlighted\n\n### **9. Progressive Disclosure**\n- Show essential confirmation info immediately\n- Secondary details (cancellation policy, hotel contact, directions) available via expansion or secondary tabs\n\n### **10. Digital Integration Features (2026 Trends)**\n- \"Add to Wallet\" for mobile key/check-in\n- Calendar integration buttons\n- QR code for quick mobile access\n- Share booking option for group travelers\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Layout Structure:**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  ✓ Booking Confirmed                    │\n│  Confirmation #: ABC123456              │\n│  Hotel Grand Plaza | 3 Rooms | Jun 1-5  │\n│  Total: $1,245.00                       │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  [Room 1 Card - Expandable]             │\n│  Deluxe King | Jun 1-5 | $415.00        │\n│  └─ [Expand for details]                │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  [Room 2 Card - Expandable]             │\n│  Twin Suite | Jun 1-5 | $415.00         │\n│  └─ [Expand for details]                │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  [Room 3 Card - Expandable]             │\n│  Standard Queen | Jun 1-5 | $415.00     │\n│  └─ [Expand for details]                │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  [Actions: Print | Email | Add to Cal]  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nThese patterns align with 2026 UX best practices emphasizing frictionless booking flows, clear confirmations, mobile optimization, and reduced cognitive load through progressive disclosure.","hint":"A good answer should propose concrete UI patterns tailored to a multi-room hotel booking confirmation page, including a clear grouped summary of all rooms (room types, dates, guests, pricing per room and total), easily scannable room-level details (amenities, bed type, cancellation policy), and confirmation essentials (booking reference, guest/contact info, payment status, and modification/cancellation affordances), while emphasizing clarity, hierarchy, and support for 2026-relevant contexts like mobile-first, responsive layouts and accessibility.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best UI patterns for a multi-room hotel booking confirmation page that shows all room details in 2026?","timestamp":33924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":33924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RPFySQE4mGDuDqtMFVwZEB","status":"completed","timestamp":33924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019huKCfonZ97CirsjEojWh6","status":"completed","timestamp":33924},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0157oeAzZSEu3GF4MBH1Uat1","status":"completed","timestamp":33924},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here are the **best UI patterns for a multi-room hotel booking confirmation page** in 2026:\n\n---\n\n## **Best UI Patterns for Multi-Room Hotel Booking Confirmation Pages (2026)**\n\n### **1.
