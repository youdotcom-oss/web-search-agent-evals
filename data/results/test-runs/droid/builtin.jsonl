Use `spawn` Start Method (Most Important)\n\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n# Set at the very beginning of your script\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n```\n\nOr use a context:\n```python\nctx = mp.get_context('spawn')\npool = ctx.Pool(num_workers)\n```\n\n### 2. Load Model in Main Process Before Spawning\n\n```python\n# CORRECT: Load in main process, then spawn\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    model = MyModel()\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoint.pth'))\n    model.share_memory()  # For sharing across processes\n    \n    # Now spawn child processes\n    mp.spawn(worker_fn, args=(model,), nprocs=num_gpus)\n```\n\n### 3. Use `map_location` When Loading\n\n```python\n# Avoid CUDA initialization issues\ncheckpoint = torch.load('model.pth', map_location='cpu')\nmodel.load_state_dict(checkpoint)\n# Move to GPU only after loading\nmodel.to(device)\n```\n\n### 4. Fix State Dict Key Mismatches\n\n```python\n# If keys don't match (e.g., 'module.' prefix from DDP)\ncheckpoint = torch.load('model.pth')\nnew_state_dict = {k.replace('module.', ''): v for k, v in checkpoint.items()}\nmodel.load_state_dict(new_state_dict)\n```\n\n### 5. Use `weights_only=True` (PyTorch 2.x+)\n\n```python\n# Safer and can avoid some serialization issues\ncheckpoint = torch.load('model.pth', weights_only=True)\n```\n\n### 6. For DataLoader Workers\n\n```python\n# Use proper worker_init_fn\ndef worker_init_fn(worker_id):\n    torch.manual_seed(worker_id)\n\ndataloader = DataLoader(\n    dataset,\n    num_workers=4,\n    multiprocessing_context='spawn',  # Explicit context\n    worker_init_fn=worker_init_fn\n)\n```\n\n### 7.

Note: There is no plugin called \"vite-plugin-vue-cron\" - the correct package is **@vue-js-cron/element-plus**, which is designed specifically for use with Element Plus in Vue 3 projects (including Vite-based projects).\n\n---\n\n## How to Use @vue-js-cron/element-plus with Vue 3 and Element Plus (2026)\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\nEnsure you have a Vue 3 project with Element Plus already set up. If not:\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Vue 3 + Vite project\nnpm create vue@latest my-project\ncd my-project\n\n# Install Element Plus\nnpm install element-plus\n```\n\n### 2. Install the Package\n\n```bash\nnpm install @vue-js-cron/element-plus\n# or\nyarn add @vue-js-cron/element-plus\n```\n\nThe latest version is **3.1.10** (as of 2026).\n\n### 3. Register the Component\n\n**Option A: Global Registration (main.js/main.ts)**\n\n```javascript\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\nimport App from './App.vue'\nimport ElementPlus from 'element-plus'\nimport 'element-plus/dist/index.css'\n\n// Import the cron component CSS and plugin\nimport '@vue-js-cron/element-plus/dist/element-plus.css'\nimport CronElementPlusPlugin from '@vue-js-cron/element-plus'\n\nconst app = createApp(App)\napp.use(ElementPlus)\napp.use(CronElementPlusPlugin)  // Registers globally as <CronElementPlus>\napp.mount('#app')\n```\n\n**Option B: Local Registration (per component)**\n\n```javascript\nimport '@vue-js-cron/element-plus/dist/element-plus.css'\nimport { CronElementPlus } from '@vue-js-cron/element-plus'\n\nexport default {\n  components: { CronElementPlus }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Basic Usage Example\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <cron-element-plus\n      v-model=\"cronValue\"\n      :button-props=\"{ type: 'primary' }\"\n      @error=\"handleError\"\n    />\n    \n    <p>Cron expression: {{ cronValue }}</p>\n    <p v-if=\"error\" style=\"color: red;\">Error: {{ error }}</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script setup>\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst cronValue = ref('* * * * *')\nconst error = ref('')\n\nconst handleError = (err) => {\n  error.value = err\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### 5. Available Props\n\n| Prop | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `modelValue` | `string` | The cron expression (v-model) |\n| `buttonProps` | `object` | Element Plus Button attributes |\n| `dropdownProps` | `object` | Element Plus Dropdown attributes |\n| `disabled` | `boolean` | Disable the editor |\n| `locale` | `string` | Locale for translations |\n| `customLocale` | `object` | Custom localization object |\n| `fields` | `array` | Custom field configuration |\n| `format` | `string` | Cron format (e.g., 'quartz', 'crontab') |\n| `period` | `string` | Default period selection |\n| `periods` | `array` | Available period options |\n| `cols` | `object` | Column layout configuration |\n\n### 6.
