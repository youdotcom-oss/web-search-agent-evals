The dataset is NOT related to lung injury or radiation/immunotherapy. A correct response should note this mismatch and clarify that GSE201705 concerns spider embryo development and Hedgehog signaling, not pulmonary research. The lung injury \"cellular atlas of senescent lineages\" study uses PRJNA846488/GSE135893 instead.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"What is the latest 2026 research on GSE201705 regarding single cell lung injury from radiation and immunotherapy?","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QRRKM12CC3fnQuHyf6eXEV","status":"completed","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Rt1j6LajcoPyBApyR7mBj4","status":"completed","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"FetchUrl","status":"pending","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SBVRFk9rMmpGzgiFzei6iJ","status":"completed","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Pnq4f45xYj4JdonTqsZRL9","status":"completed","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01GvFwF6aPgM3e4jsZvAFgFu","status":"completed","timestamp":69371},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SPgyPbbufeETjw84njbbB1","status":"completed","timestamp":69371},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my comprehensive web search, here's a summary of the latest 2026 research on GSE201705 regarding single cell lung injury from radiation and immunotherapy:\n\n## GSE201705 Dataset Overview\n\n**GSE201705** is a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from the study **\"Cellular Atlas of Senescent Lineages in Radiation- or Immunotherapy-Induced Lung Injury\"** published in the *International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics* (2023, PMID: 36792015).
