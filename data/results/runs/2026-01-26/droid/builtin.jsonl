The latest version (v3.12.1) uses Azure REST API version 2024-10-01.\n\n2. **Alternative Package**: `azure.cognitive.Deployment` from the Pulumi Azure (classic) provider also supports OpenAI model deployments.\n\n3. **New Resource**: `azure-native.elastic.OpenAI` package (v3.12.0, published December 2025) provides integration for OpenAI resources within Azure.\n\n### Deployment Options in Azure AI Foundry (2026)\n\n- **Standard Deployment**: Uses Foundry resources\n- **Serverless API Endpoints**: Scalable, cost-effective access\n- **Managed Computes**: Enhanced performance\n- **Provisioned Throughput**: For guaranteed capacity\n\n### Important 2026 Updates\n\n1. **Model Retirement**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4o versions (2024-05-13 and 2024-08-06) are retiring on March 31, 2026. The replacement is GPT-5.1 (version 2025-11-13).\n\n2. **Quota Considerations**: At scale (50+ models), Azure subscription-level quota limits can cause deployment failures. Plan for quota management in Pulumi code.\n\n3. **API Transition**: Microsoft recommends transitioning from Azure AI Inference beta SDK to the OpenAI/v1 API for better compatibility.\n\n### Example Pulumi Code Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// Using azure-native provider\nimport * as azure from \"@pulumi/azure-native\";\n\nconst deployment = new azure.cognitiveservices.Deployment(\"gpt-deployment\", {\n    accountName: cognitiveAccount.name,\n    deploymentName: \"gpt-deployment\",\n    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,\n    properties: {\n        model: {\n            format: \"OpenAI\",\n            name: \"gpt-4\",\n            version: \"2024-05-13\"\n        }\n    },\n    sku: {\n        name: \"Standard\",\n        capacity: 1\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Useful References\n\n- **Detailed Guide**: [Provisioning Azure OpenAI service using Pulumi](https://onlyutkarsh.medium.com/provisioning-azure-openai-service-using-pulumi) by Utkarsh Shigihalli\n- **Pulumi Registry**: [azure-native.cognitiveservices.Deployment](https://pulumi.com/registry/packages/azure-native/api-docs/cognitiveservices/deployment)\n- **Microsoft Docs**: [How to deploy Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models-openai)\n\nIs there a specific aspect of Pulumi Azure AI Foundry GPT model deployment you'd like me to explore further, or would you like me to help you create a Pulumi project for this?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: Pulumi Azure AI Foundry GPT model deployment 2026</web-search>","timestamp":33331},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":33331},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0148121jYprsF5bvon9b9x2S","status":"completed","timestamp":33331},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HN9GSEPPNHyZsfx6X6n9c7","status":"completed","timestamp":33331},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search, I found comprehensive information about deploying Azure OpenAI/GPT models using Pulumi.

**Conversation Node**: Manages logic by integrating messages with agent identity\n   - **Retrieval Tool Node**: Uses MongoDB for vector searches\n   - **Summarize Context Node**: Condenses long passages before prompt inclusion\n   - **Summarize Conversation Node**: Maintains coherence by summarizing earlier messages\n   - **End Node**: Updates memory and context with each interaction\n\n2. **Production Trinity (2026)**:\n   - **LangGraph** for multi-agent workflow orchestration\n   - **RAG** for graph-based knowledge retrieval\n   - **UCP (Universal Context Protocol)** for transactional capabilities\n   - Enterprises reporting up to 45% performance improvements\n\n### Context Engineering Best Practices\n\n- **Writing, selecting, compressing, and isolating context** are key strategies\n- State management is emphasized as **more important than context size**\n- Focus on how to leverage RAG and manage state rather than just increasing context windows\n\n### Key Resources\n\n- **LangChain Memory Documentation**: `https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/memory`\n- **SWMansion Tutorial Series**: Building Agents with LangGraph (Part 3/4 covers RAG and Long-Term Memory)\n- **Medium articles**: Practical implementations from Sangeethasaravanan and Paul Iusztin\n\nWould you like me to fetch any of these URLs for more detailed information, or do you have a specific task you'd like me to help with related to LangGraph and RAG implementation?","timestamp":25002}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"LangGraph","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769457194425,"end":1769457219427,"firstResponse":25002,"sessionCreation":0,"total":25002},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.95,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

The response is relevant and provides a good overview of LangGraph memory state management and RAG context injection, assuming the information related to 2026 represents advancements/expectations in these areas. The organization is clear, and the inclusion of key resources is helpful. However, I can't fully verify the accuracy of forward-looking statements related to 2026 technology and specific architectures like 'Production Trinity'. The PhiloAgent architecture seems reasonable within current trends and is likely accurately reported. The context engineering best practices align with existing knowledge. Given the limitations of verifying future predictions, the score is slightly reduced.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":false,"mcpToolCalled":false,"deterministicScore":60,"llmScore":35,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false}}}

Simply define a function with proper docstrings and type hints, then pass it to the `tools` parameter:\n\n```python\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\n\ndef get_top_hackernews_stories(num_stories: int = 10) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Use this function to get top stories from Hacker News.\"\"\"\n    # implementation...\n\nagent = Agent(tools=[get_top_hackernews_stories], markdown=True)\n```\n\n### The `@tool` Decorator\n\nFor advanced customization, use the `@tool` decorator with options like:\n- `requires_confirmation=True` - Requires user confirmation before execution\n- `stop_after_tool_call=True` - Stop agent after tool call\n- `cache_results=True` - Cache tool results\n- `tool_hooks` - Run custom logic before/after calls\n\n### Built-in Search Tools for Web Search\n\n| Tool | Import | Description |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| **DuckDuckGo** | `from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools` | Web search |\n| **Tavily** | `from agno.tools.tavily import TavilyTools` | AI-optimized search |\n| **Exa** | `from agno.tools.exa import ExaTools` | Neural search |\n| **Brave** | `from agno.tools.bravesearch import BraveSearchTools` | Privacy-focused search |\n| **Serper** | `from agno.tools.serper import SerperTools` | Google search API |\n| **SerpAPI** | `from agno.tools.serpapi import SerpAPITools` | Search engine results |\n\n### Example: Web Search with DuckDuckGo\n\n```python\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\n\nagent = Agent(tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()])\nagent.print_response(\"Search for the latest AI news\")\n```\n\n### Other Tool Categories\n\nAgno also provides built-in tools for:\n- **Finance**: YFinance, OpenBB\n- **Databases**: Postgres, DuckDB, Neo4j, SQL\n- **Web Scraping**: Firecrawl, Crawl4AI, Newspaper\n- **Social/Communication**: Slack, Discord, X (Twitter), Email\n- **Productivity**: Google Calendar/Sheets/Drive, Notion, Jira\n- **Developer**: GitHub, Shell, Python, Docker\n- **AI/Media**: DALL-E, ElevenLabs, YouTube\n\n### Built-in Parameters in Tools\n\nAgno automatically injects parameters into tool functions:\n- `run_context` - Access session state, dependencies, metadata\n- `agent` - The agent object\n- `team` - The team object  \n- `images`, `videos`, `audio`, `files` - Media objects","timestamp":38720}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Agent_Framework","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769457347881,"end":1769457386601,"firstResponse":38720,"sessionCreation":0,"total":38720},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.95,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

This means:\n- Even if you block a port with UFW, Docker containers with that port published remain accessible from the internet\n- Docker binds container ports to `0.0.0.0` by default, exposing services to all interfaces\n- This is a well-known security issue that has existed since at least 2018\n\n### Solutions (from most recommended to least)\n\n#### 1. **Bind Ports to localhost Only** (Simplest)\nIn your `docker-compose.yml` or docker run command, bind ports to `127.0.0.1`:\n```yaml\nservices:\n  my-app:\n    ports:\n      - \"127.0.0.1:8080:80\"\n```\nThis prevents external access entirely - only local connections work. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, traefik) on the host to expose services.\n\n#### 2. **Use ufw-docker Tool** (Recommended for production)\nThe [chaifeng/ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) project provides an automated solution:\n```bash\nsudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/raw/master/ufw-docker\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker\nsudo ufw-docker install\nsudo systemctl restart ufw\n```\nThen manage container access with:\n```bash\nufw-docker allow container_name 80/tcp\n```\n\n#### 3. **Modify UFW's after.rules** (Manual approach)\nEdit `/etc/ufw/after.rules` and add rules for the `DOCKER-USER` chain:\n```\n*filter\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 10.0.0.0/8\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 172.16.0.0/12\n-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN -s 192.168.0.0/16\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080\nCOMMIT\n```\nThen restart UFW: `sudo systemctl restart ufw`\n\n#### 4. **Disable Docker's iptables Management** (Not recommended)\nSet `\"iptables\": false` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. This breaks container networking unless you manually configure all rules.\n\n#### 5. **Use Docker Networks for Internal Communication**\nCreate isolated networks for services that don't need external access:\n```yaml\nnetworks:\n  internal:\n    internal: true  # No external access\n\nservices:\n  database:\n    networks:\n      - internal\n```\n\n### Best Practice Recommendation\nFor most use cases, combine these approaches:\n1. Use `127.0.0.1:port:port` binding for services that need external access through a reverse proxy\n2. Use internal Docker networks for service-to-service communication\n3.

The solutions provided are relevant to the query, and the response addresses different aspects of the problem, making it fairly complete. The `ufw-docker` tool is indeed a recommended solution.

Here's what I found:\n\n### What It Is\n- A custom error in LI.FI's facet contracts that prevents bridging operations when the source and destination chains are identical\n- Part of LI.FI's Diamond Contract architecture (EIP-2535 Multi-facet Proxy standard)\n\n### When It Occurs\nThis error is thrown when a user or contract attempts to:\n- Bridge assets to the **same blockchain network** from which they originated\n- For example: trying to bridge tokens from Arbitrum to Arbitrum, or Ethereum to Ethereum\n\n### Why It Exists\n- **Bridging by definition** requires cross-chain transactions between different networks\n- Same-network transfers should use regular transfers or swaps, not bridging mechanisms\n- It's a validation check to prevent invalid or wasteful transactions\n\n### How to Resolve\n1.

Let me provide you with a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Summary: HTTPX Trace Callback for Computing TTFB in Python\n\n### Key Approaches\n\n**1. Using the \"trace\" Extension (Most Granular)**\n\nThe httpx library provides a `trace` extension that allows you to monitor internal events during a request:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\n\ndef log(event_name, info):\n    print(event_name, info)\n\nclient = httpx.Client()\nresponse = client.get(\"https://www.example.com/\", extensions={\"trace\": log})\n```\n\nThis captures events like:\n- Connection establishment\n- TLS negotiation\n- Response receipt (for TTFB calculation)\n\n**2. Using Event Hooks**\n\nHTTPX provides two event hooks:\n- `request` - called after request is prepared but before sending\n- `response` - called after response is received\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\ndef log_response_time(response):\n    duration = time.time() - response.request.start_time\n    print(f\"Response time for {response.request.url}: {duration:.2f} seconds\")\n\nclient = httpx.Client(event_hooks={'response': [log_response_time]})\n```\n\n**3. Using response.elapsed**\n\nThe simplest approach uses the built-in `elapsed` property:\n\n```python\nimport httpx\n\nasync def trace_callback(response):\n    ttfb = response.elapsed.total_seconds()\n    print(f'Time to First Byte: {ttfb} seconds')\n\nasync def fetch_url(url):\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        response = await client.get(url, hooks={'response': trace_callback})\n        return response\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The `response.elapsed` property measures time until response headers are received (which is essentially TTFB), not the time to download the entire response body.\n\n### Documentation References\n\n- **Extensions Documentation**: https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/extensions/\n- **Event Hooks Documentation**: https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/event-hooks/\n- **API Reference**: https://www.python-httpx.org/api/\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like me to help you implement with httpx tracing or TTFB measurement?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: httpx trace callback response headers timing example compute ttfb python 2026</web-search>","timestamp":23294},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":23294},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01QfNxof7nYhZQVXPqPjjWAc","status":"completed","timestamp":23294},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I now have comprehensive information about using httpx trace callbacks to compute TTFB (Time to First Byte) in Python.

WindowInsets API**\n- Use the `WindowInsets` API to properly manage layouts and ensure app content doesn't overlap with system UI elements\n- The API is crucial for determining safe areas for content placement\n\n**2. Gesture Navigation Compatibility**\n- Gesture navigation (swipe-based) is the preferred user experience since Android 10\n- Apps should extend content to screen edges while respecting gesture exclusion zones\n- Use `View.setSystemGestureExclusionRects()` to specify regions that should not trigger system back gestures (to prevent conflicts with app navigation elements)\n\n**3. Implementation Best Practices**\n- **Jetpack Compose**: Use Material 3 `Scaffold` component which handles insets automatically\n- **Views**: Call `enableEdgeToEdge()` in the `onCreate` method of your Activity for Android 14 and below\n- Apply appropriate padding/margins to prevent interactive elements from being hidden behind system bars\n- Consider display cutouts when laying out content\n\n**4.

According to Google's Go style guide, \"filenames of source code are not considered Go identifiers and can contain underscores\"\n\n### Common Practice\nWhile not strictly required, it's common practice to:\n- Have a main file with the same name as the package (e.g., `http.go` in package `http`)\n- Use descriptive file names that indicate the file's contents (e.g., `server.go`, `client.go`, `handler.go`)\n\n### Key Takeaways\n1. The package name is declared in the `package` statement at the top of Go files\n2. All `.go` files in a directory should have the same package name\n3. File names don't need to match the package name - they can describe the file's contents\n4.

It provides relevant solutions like reinstalling `govulncheck` with the correct Go version and aligning the Go version in the PATH. The CI/CD example using GitHub Actions is also helpful. The information is generally accurate and addresses the query well. The reference to a similar issue with staticcheck from 2025 adds credibility, even though the query also mentioned 2026. All aspects were addressed well, with a few specific instances in CI/CD environments unaddressed, and the reasoning does not focus on just govulncheck for 1.24 and instead speaks in general, which is fine but misses an opportunity for depth.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":false,"mcpToolCalled":false,"deterministicScore":60,"llmScore":35,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false}}}

This allows web developers to send push notifications to users through:\n- **Push API**\n- **Notifications API**  \n- **Service Workers**\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n1. **Add to Home Screen**: Users must add the website to their Home Screen for push notifications to work. The site cannot receive push notifications when viewed only in Safari browser - it must be installed as a web app.\n\n2. **Web App Manifest**: A `manifest.json` file is required with:\n   - `display` property set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"`\n   - Required fields: `name`, `short_name`, `start_url`, `icons`\n\n3. **HTTPS**: The web app must be served over HTTPS\n\n4. **User Permission**: Push notification permission must be requested via user interaction (e.g., button click), not automatically\n\n5. **Service Worker**: A service worker must be registered to handle push events\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. User adds website to Home Screen via Safari's Share menu → \"Add to Home Screen\"\n2. Web app requests notification permission through user gesture\n3. User grants permission via iOS prompt\n4. Notifications appear on Lock Screen, Notification Center, and Apple Watch (same as native apps)\n\n### Known Limitations (as of iOS 16.4)\n- Custom notification actions may not appear (only default \"View\" action)\n- Some features like badges and custom sounds have limited support\n- The `notificationclick` event may not redirect to intended pages correctly\n\n### New Development: Declarative Web Push (iOS 18.4+, 2025)\nApple introduced **Declarative Web Push** which:\n- Doesn't require an installed service worker\n- Is more energy-efficient\n- Enhances user privacy\n- Maintains backwards compatibility with traditional Web Push\n- Available in iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS 15.5\n\n### Best Practices\n- Create an \"Add to Home Screen\" banner to guide users through the installation process\n- Test thoroughly on iOS devices\n- Follow W3C standards (same as Safari 16.1 on macOS)\n\nIs there something specific about iOS web push notifications you'd like me to help you implement or explore further?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: Apple Safari iOS 16.4 web push notifications for web apps Add to Home Screen Push API 2025 documenta</web-search>","timestamp":25997},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":25997},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PsAXrqrtnYsxC4TARz9U1i","status":"completed","timestamp":25997},{"type":"message","content":"I have gathered comprehensive information about Apple Safari iOS web push notifications.

The error happens when the OAuth callback is triggered **twice** - the first call succeeds and consumes the OAuth state, but the second call fails because the state has already been used.\n\n### Root Causes\n1. **Double-callback triggering**: The OAuth callback endpoint is being called twice\n2. **Cookie/state misconfiguration**: Issues with `SameSite`, `Secure`, and `httpOnly` cookie attributes\n3. **Incorrect callbackURL configuration**: Using the API callback endpoint instead of a user-facing route\n4. **Cross-subdomain cookie issues**: Misconfigured domain settings\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Add the `nextCookies()` plugin** (Most common fix for Next.js):\n   ```typescript\n   import { betterAuth } from \"better-auth\";\n   import { nextCookies } from \"better-auth/next-js\";\n\n   export const auth = betterAuth({\n     socialProviders: {\n       google: {\n         clientId: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,\n         clientSecret: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,\n       },\n     },\n     plugins: [nextCookies()], // Required for Server Functions\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure callbackURL points to a user-facing route** (not the API callback):\n   - Use routes like `/dashboard` or `/` instead of `/api/auth/callback/google`\n\n3. **Configure cookie settings properly**:\n   ```typescript\n   advanced: {\n     cookies: {\n       state: {\n         attributes: {\n           sameSite: \"lax\",  // or \"none\" for cross-site\n           secure: true,      // true for HTTPS, false for localhost\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Cross-subdomain configuration** (if applicable):\n   - Don't include protocol in domain: use `\"localhost\"` not `\"http://localhost\"`\n   ```typescript\n   advanced: {\n     crossSubDomainCookies: {\n       enabled: true,\n       domain: \"yourdomain.com\", // No protocol!\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify trustedOrigins** include all your domains:\n   ```typescript\n   trustedOrigins: [\n     \"https://yourdomain.com\",\n     \"https://*.vercel.app\",\n     \"*localhost:3000\"\n   ]\n   ```\n\n### Version Notes\n- This issue is tracked in **GitHub Issue #5658**\n- The issue primarily affects **Next.js 16** users\n- **v1.4.10** (Dec 31, 2025) includes oauth-proxy fixes for cookie handling in non-HTTPS environments\n- No specific version completely \"fixes\" the double-callback; it requires proper configuration\n\n### Debugging Steps\n1. Use browser DevTools to check if the callback is firing twice\n2. Verify cookie attributes are being set correctly\n3. Clear stale cookies in development\n4. Check that your OAuth provider's callback URLs match your configuration","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: better-auth 1.4.10 release notes \"please_restart_the_process\" double callback 2026</web-search>","timestamp":60028},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":60028},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0188hmViZWCMR3fgSfXmPdEM","status":"completed","timestamp":60028},{"type":"message","content":"I found relevant information.

For example, using `ubuntu:22.04` as the runtime stage when the application needs `node`.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Remove the Start Command**: If you have a custom start command in Railway that uses `cd`, try removing it and let Railway use the Dockerfile's `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instead.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Base Image**: Ensure your Dockerfile's runtime stage uses an appropriate base image:\n   - For Node.js apps: Use `node:18-alpine` or similar\n   - For Python apps: Use `python:3.11-slim` or similar\n   - Avoid using base images like `ubuntu:22.04` for Node.js apps\n\n3. **Use `WORKDIR` Instead of `cd`**: In your Dockerfile, use `WORKDIR /app` instead of `RUN cd /app`. `WORKDIR` is the proper Docker way to change directories.\n\n4. **Verify Your Dockerfile Locally**: Test your Docker build locally first:\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t myapp .\n   docker run myapp\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Your Path Configuration**: If using a custom start command, use absolute paths rather than relying on `cd`:\n   ```\n   # Instead of: cd /app && node server.js\n   # Use: node /app/server.js\n   # Or simply: node server.js (if WORKDIR is set correctly)\n   ```\n\n### Example Fix\n\nIf your Dockerfile has:\n```dockerfile\nFROM ubuntu:22.04 AS runtime\n# ...\n```\n\nChange it to the appropriate runtime image:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:18-alpine AS runtime\n# ...\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you debug a specific Dockerfile or Railway configuration?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: Railway \"cd could not be found\" container failed to start 2026</web-search>","timestamp":25602},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":25602},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_014JFttyWfMdWokz88X2mhJW","status":"completed","timestamp":25602},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the web search results, I can provide you with information about the Railway \"cd could not be found\" container startup error.\n\n## Summary: Railway \"cd could not be found\" Error\n\nThis is a common deployment error on Railway when the platform cannot find the `cd` (change directory) command.

This happens because:\n1. First click activates the label's click handler\n2. The label then simulates a click on the associated checkbox\n3. This causes the event to bubble up and trigger the label's handler again\n\n### Solutions\n\n**1. Use `htmlFor` attribute (React's equivalent of `for`):**\n```jsx\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"check3\" />\n<label htmlFor=\"check3\">Click me</label>\n```\nThis associates the label with the checkbox without wrapping, reducing event complexity.\n\n**2. Use Controlled Components with `onChange`:**\n```jsx\nfunction CheckboxForm() {\n    const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);\n    \n    return (\n        <label>\n            <input\n                type=\"checkbox\"\n                checked={isChecked}\n                onChange={(e) => setIsChecked(e.target.checked)}\n            />\n            Subscribe to updates\n        </label>\n    );\n}\n```\n\n**3. Stop Event Propagation when needed:**\n```jsx\n<label htmlFor=\"thing\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n    label for checkbox\n</label>\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n- Use `onChange` instead of `onClick` for checkbox state management\n- Ensure the checkbox's `id` matches the label's `htmlFor` attribute\n- When using controlled components, make sure the `onChange` handler updates the state\n- For nested structures (like checkboxes in table rows), use `e.stopPropagation()` on both the label and checkbox if needed\n\nIs there a specific implementation or issue you're working on that I can help you with?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: React onClick on label and input interaction for checkboxes 2026</web-search>","timestamp":24569},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":24569},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01SAVa79msV2u1JSUX8mv54T","status":"completed","timestamp":24569},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, here's what I found about React onClick on label and input interaction for checkboxes:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### The Double-Click Issue\nWhen using `onClick` on a label element that wraps or is associated with a checkbox, clicking the label triggers the event **twice**.

The `execute()` method now requires an **executable object** rather than a plain string. This change:\n\n1. Makes code more explicit about what's being executed\n2. Improves type safety\n3. Better differentiates between SQL expressions and plain strings\n\n### Common Scenarios\n\n**1. Basic queries:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text, create_engine\n\nengine = create_engine(\"sqlite:///example.db\")\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(text(\"SELECT 1\"))\n```\n\n**2.

With Pandas `read_sql`:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\n# SQLAlchemy 2.x compatible\ndf = pd.read_sql(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\"), connection)\n```\n\n### Migration Tips\n\nIf you're migrating from SQLAlchemy 1.x to 2.x:\n\n1. Search your codebase for `.execute(` calls with string arguments\n2. Wrap all raw SQL strings with `text()`\n3.

Here's a summary of what I found:\n\n## Expo AsyncStorage - Storing Data Locally (SDK 54)\n\n### Overview\nAsyncStorage (`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`) is an **asynchronous, unencrypted, persistent key-value storage** solution for React Native and Expo applications. It's included in Expo Go and supports multiple platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, tvOS, and Web.\n\n### Installation (Expo SDK 54)\n```bash\nnpx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\n### Core API Methods\n- **`setItem(key, value)`** - Stores a string value for a given key\n- **`getItem(key)`** - Retrieves a string value for a given key (returns null if not found)\n- **`mergeItem(key, value)`** - Merges a new value with an existing one\n- **`removeItem(key)`** - Removes a value for a given key\n- **`getAllKeys()`** - Gets all keys in storage\n- **`multiGet(keys)`** - Gets multiple values at once\n- **`multiSet(keyValuePairs)`** - Sets multiple values at once\n- **`clear()`** - Clears all data\n\n### Basic Usage Example\n```javascript\nimport AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';\n\n// Store data\nawait AsyncStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');\n\n// Store objects (must stringify)\nawait AsyncStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({ name: 'John', age: 30 }));\n\n// Retrieve data\nconst username = await AsyncStorage.getItem('username');\n\n// Retrieve and parse objects\nconst userJson = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user');\nconst user = userJson != null ? JSON.parse(userJson) : null;\n\n// Remove data\nawait AsyncStorage.removeItem('username');\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n- Use for **small amounts of data** like user preferences, settings, or app state\n- Values must be **strings** - use `JSON.stringify()` for objects\n- Operations are **asynchronous** and don't block the main thread\n\n### Alternative Storage Options in Expo\n| Library | Use Case |\n|---------|----------|\n| **AsyncStorage** | Simple key-value pairs, user preferences |\n| **expo-secure-store** | Encrypted, sensitive data (tokens, credentials) |\n| **expo-sqlite** | Complex queries, relational data |\n| **expo-file-system** | File storage, large binary data |\n\nFor more details, see the official documentation:\n- [Expo AsyncStorage Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/async-storage/)\n- [Store Data Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/store-data)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search>Find current information about: Expo documentation AsyncStorage store data locally Expo SDK 54 AsyncStorage 2026</web-search>","timestamp":24589},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":24589},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0149Dd2VdxJ4RWpjjtAtYeAH","status":"completed","timestamp":24589},{"type":"message","content":"I found the information about Expo AsyncStorage for storing data locally.

Let me provide a summary of the key findings:\n\n## LiveKit Agents v1.2 MCP Implementation - Breaking Changes & Fixes (2025)\n\n### Key Issues & Fixes Found:\n\n**1. Agent Silent After MCP Tool Execution (v1.2.7) - [Issue #3295](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/3295)**\n- **Problem**: In v1.2.7, agents would go silent after using MCP tools (regression from v1.2.6)\n- **Root Cause**: Bug in the ElevenLabs TTS plugin introduced in v1.2.7\n- **Fix**: Resolved in [PR #3284](https://github.com/livekit/agents/pull/3284), released in v1.2.8\n- **Workaround**: Downgrade `livekit-plugins-elevenlabs` to 1.2.6\n\n**2.
