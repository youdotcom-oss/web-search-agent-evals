PostgreSQL allows omitting parameters that have defaults, especially via named notation.

{"id":"websearch-934","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow to use LangGraph human interrupt and resume in Python with HumanInterrupt types and the Command object in 2026?","output":"Below is the current (as of February 6, 2026) Python way to use LangGraph “human interrupt + resume” with `HumanInterrupt` and `Command`. I’ll show the minimal, correct flow and the Agent Inbox–style `HumanInterrupt` list pattern, plus the key rules about checkpointing and resume ordering. ([reference.langchain.com](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Key points (current behavior)**  \n- `interrupt()` raises a `GraphInterrupt` the first time it’s hit in a node; it resumes by re-running the node with a `Command(resume=...)`. ([reference.langchain.com](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/?utm_source=openai))  \n- You must enable a checkpointer; interrupts rely on persisted state. ([reference.langchain.com](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/?utm_source=openai))  \n- If you call `interrupt()` multiple times in one node, resume values are matched by order of the calls. ([reference.langchain.com](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/?utm_source=openai))  \n- `HumanInterrupt` was moved (deprecated in the `langgraph` agents ref) to `langchain.agents.interrupt`. Update your imports accordingly.

(I used ydc‑server for discovery and verified against official Go docs and issue reports.) ([tip.golang.org](https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Common causes and how to resolve**\n\n1) `go.mod` / `go.work` declares a **minimum Go version higher than your toolchain**\n- **Cause:** Since Go 1.21, the `go` line is a strict minimum. If your installed toolchain is lower than the declared `go` version, the `go` command refuses to load the module/workspace, so `govulncheck` fails early. ([tip.golang.org](https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Fix:** Upgrade the toolchain to at least the `go` version declared, or lower the `go` line if the code doesn’t actually require newer language features. You can let the go command auto‑select a newer toolchain via `GOTOOLCHAIN`, or update the module’s `go`/`toolchain` lines with `go get`. ([tip.golang.org](https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) **Invalid `go` line format** when older Go parses a newer `go.mod`\n- **Cause:** Older toolchains (e.g., Go 1.20) can reject `go` lines that include patch versions (`go 1.21.0`), yielding errors like “invalid go version … must match format 1.23.” This often happens when a newer `go mod init` wrote a patch‑level version. ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61851?utm_source=openai))\n- **Fix:** Change `go 1.21.0` → `go 1.21` (or run `go mod edit -go=1.21`). If you need compatibility with older Go, avoid patch‑level versions in the `go` line. ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61851?utm_source=openai))\n\n3) **`toolchain` directive forces a newer Go than your CI/dev environment**\n- **Cause:** The `toolchain` line can instruct Go to use a newer toolchain than your default. In CI or controlled environments, that can lead to mismatches or unintended upgrades. ([tip.golang.org](https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Fix:** Either remove the `toolchain` line for stricter pinning to your CI‑installed Go, or explicitly set `GOTOOLCHAIN` in CI to the intended version. ([tip.golang.org](https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n\n4) **Toolchain auto‑download blocked** (proxy/sumdb restrictions)\n- **Cause:** When Go needs a newer toolchain, it downloads it as a module. If `GOSUMDB=off` or your proxy policy blocks those downloads, the toolchain fetch fails, so `govulncheck` fails. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- **Fix:** Allow toolchain downloads (configure `GOPROXY` and enable `GOSUMDB`), or preinstall the required Go version on the system and set `GOTOOLCHAIN=path`/update `PATH` accordingly. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) **Mismatch between the Go version used for analysis and the one you expect**\n- **Cause:** `govulncheck` uses the `go` command on your `PATH` (or the selected toolchain). If PATH points to an older Go, analysis targets that version. ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73709882/how-to-run-govulncheck-with-a-specific-go-version?utm_source=openai))\n- **Fix:** Ensure PATH points at the intended Go version or set `GOTOOLCHAIN` to the exact version you want before running `govulncheck`.

([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) **Mismatch between the Go version used for analysis and the one you expect**\n- **Cause:** `govulncheck` uses the `go` command on your `PATH` (or the selected toolchain). If PATH points to an older Go, analysis targets that version. ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73709882/how-to-run-govulncheck-with-a-specific-go-version?utm_source=openai))\n- **Fix:** Ensure PATH points at the intended Go version or set `GOTOOLCHAIN` to the exact version you want before running `govulncheck`.

([tip.golang.org](https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- If you see “invalid go version” errors, normalize the `go` line to `go X.Y` (no patch). ([github.com](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61851?utm_source=openai))\n- If toolchain downloads are blocked, fix `GOPROXY/GOSUMDB` or preinstall the toolchain. ([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n- In CI, set `GOTOOLCHAIN` explicitly to avoid surprise upgrades.

Here’s a concise 2026-ready tutorial based on the latest shadcn/ui monorepo guidance and Turborepo’s shadcn guide.\n\n**Goal:** Set up shadcn/ui inside a Turborepo monorepo (Next.js), then add components cleanly across `apps/web` and `packages/ui`.\n\n1) Create the monorepo with the shadcn CLI  \nRun the init command and choose the monorepo option. The shadcn docs specify a “Next.js (Monorepo)” template that creates `apps/web` and `packages/ui` with Turborepo preconfigured. ([ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo?utm_source=openai))\n\n```bash\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n# Choose: Next.js (Monorepo)\n```\n\nNotes from the docs: this template uses React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4. ([ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Ensure each workspace has `components.json`  \nshadcn’s monorepo flow requires a `components.json` per workspace (e.g., `apps/web/components.json` and `packages/ui/components.json`).

Clicking the label forwards activation to the input, so you don’t need a separate label click handler. ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/label?utm_source=openai))\n- Handle state via the input’s `onChange`, not `onClick`, and read `e.target.checked` (not `value`). ([react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input?utm_source=openai))\n- Avoid attaching `onClick` to both the label and the input—this often causes double toggles because the label click fires the input click.

{"id":"websearch-1641","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nHow can I use a Figma plugin to create nodes from a JSON structure to import designs in 2026?","output":"Here’s the 2026‑safe way to do it in a Figma plugin: there is no official “create nodes from JSON” API, so you convert JSON to either (A) JSX and call `figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync`, or (B) create nodes imperatively with the standard node constructors. The JSX route is the most ergonomic for nested structures and is explicitly supported in the Plugin API. ([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Recommended approach (JSON → JSX → nodes)**  \n- Define a JSON schema that maps cleanly to the widget JSX API (e.g., type: `AutoLayout`, `Frame`, `Text`, `Image`, plus props like `padding`, `fill`, `width`, `height`, `characters`).  \n- In your plugin UI, let the user paste/choose JSON; send it to the plugin code with `postMessage`.  \n- Convert JSON to JSX and call `figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(jsx)`; append to the current page, set selection, and scroll into view. This is the official “bulk create nested nodes” path and works well for deep trees. ([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Make sure your build compiles TSX/JSX, since this API requires it. ([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nExample (core idea, simplified):\n```ts\n// ui -> main: figma.ui.postMessage({ type: \"import\", json })\nfigma.ui.onmessage = async (msg) => {\n  if (msg.type !== \"import\") return;\n  const data = JSON.parse(msg.json);\n\n  const jsx = jsonToJsx(data); // build JSX tree from your schema\n  const node = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(jsx);\n\n  figma.currentPage.appendChild(node);\n  figma.currentPage.selection = [node];\n  figma.viewport.scrollAndZoomIntoView([node]);\n};\n```\nThis leverages `figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync` which is designed for creating nested node structures. ([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Alternative (JSON → imperative nodes)**  \nIf you prefer not to use JSX, map JSON nodes to the usual constructors (`figma.createFrame()`, `figma.createText()`, `figma.createRectangle()`, etc.), then set properties and append children. This is more verbose but gives you full control. You still use the same Plugin API surface exposed on the `figma` global. ([developers.figma.com](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/api-reference/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**When JSON is SVG‑like**  \nIf your JSON can be converted to SVG, you can serialize it to an SVG string and use `figma.createNodeFromSvg(svg)` as a fast import path.

([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Make sure your build compiles TSX/JSX, since this API requires it. ([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nExample (core idea, simplified):\n```ts\n// ui -> main: figma.ui.postMessage({ type: \"import\", json })\nfigma.ui.onmessage = async (msg) => {\n  if (msg.type !== \"import\") return;\n  const data = JSON.parse(msg.json);\n\n  const jsx = jsonToJsx(data); // build JSX tree from your schema\n  const node = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(jsx);\n\n  figma.currentPage.appendChild(node);\n  figma.currentPage.selection = [node];\n  figma.viewport.scrollAndZoomIntoView([node]);\n};\n```\nThis leverages `figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync` which is designed for creating nested node structures. ([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/figma-createnodefromjsxasync/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Alternative (JSON → imperative nodes)**  \nIf you prefer not to use JSX, map JSON nodes to the usual constructors (`figma.createFrame()`, `figma.createText()`, `figma.createRectangle()`, etc.), then set properties and append children. This is more verbose but gives you full control. You still use the same Plugin API surface exposed on the `figma` global. ([developers.figma.com](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/api-reference/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**When JSON is SVG‑like**  \nIf your JSON can be converted to SVG, you can serialize it to an SVG string and use `figma.createNodeFromSvg(svg)` as a fast import path. ([figma.com](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/figma/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you share your JSON schema (or an example), I can sketch a concrete `jsonToJsx` mapper tailored to it.","timestamp":56661}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"Figma_Plugin","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-1641","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770376959014,"end":1770377015675,"firstResponse":56661,"sessionCreation":0,"total":56661},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

I’ll keep it practical and vendor‑agnostic, with options if you run on AWS/Cloudflare/Akamai.\n\n**What proxy‑rotation attacks look like**\n- Attackers rotate IPs (residential/mobile/IPv6) to evade IP‑based rate limits and bans; they keep other signals (TLS fingerprint, headers, device traits, behavior) more consistent. ([developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Modern bot defenses rely on multi‑signal scoring (behavioral analysis, fingerprinting, ML) rather than IP alone. ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/bot-management/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Detection: signals that survive IP rotation**\n1) **TLS fingerprinting (JA3/JA4) + network intelligence**\n   - Track suspicious JA3/JA4 fingerprints across many IPs and ASNs; rotate at the IP layer but not TLS/clienthello characteristics. ([developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/?utm_source=openai))  \n2) **Device/browser fingerprint + scripted telemetry**\n   - Use lightweight JS to collect high‑entropy device/browser signals; many bot frameworks reuse identical fingerprints across many IPs.

([akamai.com](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/products/cloud-security/bot-manager.jsp?utm_source=openai))  \n3) **Behavioral baselines**\n   - Model “normal” user flows and detect anomalies (timing, navigation depth, add‑to‑cart velocity, checkout cadence). Cloud‑scale bot systems do this with ML + behavior analysis. ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/bot-management/?utm_source=openai))  \n4) **Token reuse and session integrity**\n   - Detect tokens reused across many IPs/countries within short windows—strong signal of automation or proxy rotation.

([docs.cloud.google.com](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/large-pipeline-best-practices?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Use reliable storage formats**: choose ACID‑capable formats (e.g., Delta Lake) for integrity; use columnar formats like Parquet/ORC and compression for performance and cost. ([docs.databricks.com](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/lakehouse-architecture/reliability/best-practices?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Incremental processing**: prefer incremental loads where possible to reduce costs and runtime. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/serverless-etl-aws-glue/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Metadata, catalog, and lineage**: maintain a centralized data catalog and document transformations to reduce duplication and improve governance.

This reduces uncertainty and gives an immediate anchor for support. ([baymard.com](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/receipt/12056-nike?utm_source=openai))\n- **Trip summary strip**: property name, dates, total nights, total guests, total rooms, and total price (with taxes/fees). This gives a quick scan to verify the booking. ([baymard.com](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/receipt/12056-nike?utm_source=openai))\n- **Room‑by‑room section**: a stack of room cards (or accordions) each with room type, occupancy, bed type, rate plan, per‑room price breakdown, and special requests. This is the clearest way to let users verify multi‑room details. (Inference based on the need for verification and detailed confirmation content.) ([baymard.com](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/receipt/12056-nike?utm_source=openai))\n- **Policies & payment**: cancellation deadline with date/time, deposit/payment status, and a compact policy summary (with a link to full terms). Hospitality confirmations should explicitly include cancellation rules and payment info. ([littlehotelier.com](https://www.littlehotelier.com/templates/reservation-confirmation-email/?utm_source=openai))\n- **Arrival info**: check‑in/out times, reception hours or self‑check‑in instructions, property address and contact details. These are expected elements of a good confirmation. ([littlehotelier.com](https://www.littlehotelier.com/blog/get-more-bookings/reservation-confirmation/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Room details pattern (multi‑room clarity)**\n- **Room cards with expand/collapse**: show the top 2–3 key facts in the card header (room type, guests, price); expand for details (beds, rate plan, extras, policies). This keeps the page scannable while still complete. ([baymard.com](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/receipt/12056-nike?utm_source=openai))\n- **Per‑room mini‑totals**: list nightly rate × nights, taxes/fees, and room subtotal for each room, then a final “All rooms total.” Cost breakdowns improve trust and reduce post‑booking confusion. ([app.uxcel.com](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/common-patterns/checkout-best-practices-484?utm_source=openai))\n- **Guest assignment per room**: show guest names per room (or “TBD—add later”).
