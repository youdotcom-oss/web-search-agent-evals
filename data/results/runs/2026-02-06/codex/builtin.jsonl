{"id":"websearch-88","input":"How do I handle memory state management and RAG context injection in LangGraph for 2026?","output":"Before I give a precise, version-correct answer for 2026, which LangGraph stack are you using (Python or JavaScript), and are you on LangGraph Platform/Agent Server or self‑hosting? That affects the exact APIs and config.\n\nBelow is a concise, up‑to‑date mental model and the typical patterns (cited to current docs).\n\n**Key concepts you need to align on (2026)**  \n- **State = your “working memory”**. You define a state schema, and nodes return partial updates; LangGraph merges those updates into the next state (immutably). ([deepwiki.com](https://deepwiki.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraphjs-project/2.2-state-management?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Persistence = checkpointed threads**. When compiled with a checkpointer, LangGraph saves a checkpoint at each “super‑step” into a thread keyed by `thread_id`. You can resume, time‑travel, and inspect state for a given thread. ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Cross‑thread memory = Store**. Checkpointers persist per‑thread; if you need shared user memory across threads, use the Store interface. ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Runtime context ≠ state**. Runtime context is passed to nodes via `context_schema`/`contextSchema` for ephemeral, per‑run values (e.g., auth, request metadata), not for checkpointed memory. ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**How to handle memory state management (practical pattern)**  \n1) **Define a state schema** that includes only what you want checkpointed (messages, retrieved docs, intermediate reasoning artifacts).  \n2) **Pick reducers** for each state key (e.g., “append messages” vs “replace value”). In practice, message history is accumulated, while retrieval results are often replaced each turn. ([deepwiki.com](https://deepwiki.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraphjs-project/2.2-state-management?utm_source=openai))  \n3) **Compile with a checkpointer** and pass `thread_id` in `configurable` when invoking, so the state is persisted and resumable. ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence?utm_source=openai))  \n4) **Use Store for long‑term user memory** (preferences, profile) that must survive across threads. ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**How to handle RAG context injection (typical LangGraph pattern)**  \n- **Retrieve in a node**, write retrieved docs into a state key (e.g., `context` or `documents`).  \n- **Conditionally route**: use a decision node to choose whether to retrieve or answer directly (agentic RAG). ([docs.langchain.com](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/agentic-rag?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Inject into the LLM input** by constructing the prompt from `messages` + `retrieved_docs` in the generation node.  \n- **Reset or replace retrieval state each turn** to avoid stale context bleeding across steps (store new docs per user query). This aligns with LangGraph’s reducer‑based state updates. ([deepwiki.com](https://deepwiki.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraphjs-project/2.2-state-management?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**When you’re on LangGraph Platform/Agent Server**  \n- **Persistence and stores are managed for you**, so you typically only pass `thread_id` and use the default infra.

([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/?utm_source=openai))\n\nHere’s a practical, 2024‑era approach that still applies in 2026:\n\n**1) Keep Docker’s iptables rules ON (don’t set `\"iptables\": false`)**  \nDisabling Docker’s firewall management breaks container networking and can still leave ports exposed; Docker docs explicitly warn against it.

In those cases, image files arrive as `file` events in `fullStream`:\n\n```ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';\n\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: google('gemini-3-pro-image'),\n  // providerOptions enabling image modalities varies by provider/model\n  prompt: 'Generate a watercolor owl in a snowy forest.',\n});\n\nfor await (const delta of result.fullStream) {\n  switch (delta.type) {\n    case 'text-delta':\n      process.stdout.write(delta.text);\n      break;\n    case 'file':\n      if (delta.file.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {\n        await saveImage(delta.file); // your own helper\n      }\n      break;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe SDK delivers generated images via `fullStream` file events. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/image-generation/?utm_source=openai))  \nModels and configuration differ by provider; see the Image Generation docs for supported models and configuration details. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n**3) `useChat` + images (client → server)**\n\nWhen using `useChat`, send image parts from the client and convert on the server:\n\n```ts\n// app/api/chat/route.ts\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\nimport { convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n\n  const result = streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4.1'),\n    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),\n  });\n\n  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n`convertToModelMessages` handles multimodal parts from UI messages. ([v5.ai-sdk.dev](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/next/stream-text-with-image-prompt?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n**Provider/model notes you should verify in 2026**\n- **Image input support is provider/model‑specific.** The OpenAI provider docs show image inputs and optional image detail settings; this applies only to models that support vision. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai?utm_source=openai))\n- **Image output support is also provider/model‑specific.** Vercel’s Image Generation docs list supported models and how to get generated images. ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/capabilities/image-generation/ai-sdk?utm_source=openai))\n- **Streaming events:** `streamText` exposes `textStream` and `fullStream`; you need `fullStream` to receive image file events or tool events. ([ai-sdk.dev](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\nIf you share which provider/model you’re targeting (OpenAI, Gemini, v0, etc.) and whether you want **image input**, **image output**, or **both**, I can tailor a working example with the exact options for that model.","timestamp":39071}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Vercel AI SDK multimodal","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-560","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770375825368,"end":1770375864439,"firstResponse":39071,"sessionCreation":1464,"total":39071},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

([docs.pytorch.org](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.9/notes/multiprocessing.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Don’t initialize CUDA (or any accelerator) before forking.\n- If the parent process touches CUDA (e.g., `torch.cuda.is_available()`, `model.cuda()`, `torch.load(map_location=\"cuda\")`), a later `fork` can deadlock or crash.

This avoids inheriting a partially initialized model state across forks. PyTorch’s multiprocessing best‑practice guidance strongly implies this pattern for safe async training.

([go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **CI defaults to “latest Go,” which isn’t the version your module expects.**  \n  For example, the official `govulncheck` GitHub Action runs with the latest Go by default.

([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Step 1: Install + sign in**\n1) Install GitHub Desktop, open it, then sign in to your GitHub account from the app’s settings/accounts screen. ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))  \n2) The sign‑in happens in your web browser (not by typing your password directly into the app). ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github-in-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))  \n3) If you have 2‑factor authentication, you’ll confirm that during the browser sign‑in. ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github-in-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Step 2: Start with the built‑in tutorial (recommended for beginners)**\n- When you open the app with no projects, you’ll see a “Let’s get started!” screen.  \n- Choose **Create a Tutorial Repository** and follow the prompts. It teaches: create a branch, edit a file, make a commit, publish to GitHub, and open a pull request. ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Step 3: The basic everyday workflow (no coding required)**\nThink of it like “save versions of files and sync them online.”\n\n1) **Create or clone a repository**\n   - Create a new repo for your files, or clone an existing one from GitHub. ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))  \n2) **Edit files**\n   - Use any app you like (Word, Notepad, a design tool, etc.).

([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Step 1: Install + sign in**\n1) Install GitHub Desktop, open it, then sign in to your GitHub account from the app’s settings/accounts screen. ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))  \n2) The sign‑in happens in your web browser (not by typing your password directly into the app).

It teaches: create a branch, edit a file, make a commit, publish to GitHub, and open a pull request. ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Step 3: The basic everyday workflow (no coding required)**\nThink of it like “save versions of files and sync them online.”\n\n1) **Create or clone a repository**\n   - Create a new repo for your files, or clone an existing one from GitHub. ([docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop?utm_source=openai))  \n2) **Edit files**\n   - Use any app you like (Word, Notepad, a design tool, etc.).

([code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) **Reset the editor used for `.md` (custom editor hijack)**  \n- Some extensions register custom editors for `.md`.

{"id":"websearch-1764","input":"How to detect and prevent proxy rotation attacks in e-commerce platforms like Shopee in 2026?","output":"Below is a 2026‑ready, defense‑in‑depth playbook to detect and prevent proxy‑rotation attacks against e‑commerce platforms (e.g., marketplace, checkout, search, inventory, account). I’ll keep it vendor‑neutral; where relevant I cite authoritative guidance and common industry controls.\n\n**What proxy rotation attacks look like (2026 context)**\n- High‑volume automated traffic that distributes requests across many IPs (often residential proxies) to evade IP blocks and rate limits; commonly paired with credential stuffing, scraping, inventory hoarding, price arbitrage, or card‑testing. These patterns are covered broadly by OWASP’s Automated Threats project. ([owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Detection: combine signals so IP rotation doesn’t matter**\n1) Behavior & session analytics  \n- Model normal user journeys per endpoint (search → PDP → add‑to‑cart → checkout) and alert on abnormal sequences, unrealistic speeds, or excessive retries. Behavior‑based anomaly detection is a core approach in commercial bot management. ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Device/browser fingerprint consistency  \n- Track stable device signals (JS/DOM features, WebGL, canvas/audio, timezone, language, installed fonts) and detect churn that doesn’t align with legitimate device change.  \n- Watch for implausible combinations (e.g., mobile UA + desktop window sizes + unusual automation artifacts).\n\n3) TLS/HTTP stack fingerprinting  \n- Use TLS/JA3/JA4, HTTP/2 settings, header ordering, and cookie behavior to group bots across rotating IPs. Even when IPs change, the underlying client stack often stays consistent.\n\n4) Residential proxy & proxy‑network detection  \n- Many bot systems can flag traffic from known proxy networks; use those detections to reduce trust scores and apply challenges. Example: Cloudflare exposes detection IDs for residential/proxy traffic. ([developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/detection-ids/additional-detections/?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) Velocity & graph analysis across identifiers  \n- Rate‑limit by **account + device + payment instrument + shipping address + session** (not just IP).  \n- Build link analysis: if hundreds of accounts share a small set of device fingerprints or payment instruments, treat as a coordinated cluster.\n\n6) Per‑endpoint risk scoring  \n- Apply stricter detection to high‑risk endpoints (login, checkout, inventory‑sensitive items, coupon redemption, price‑scraping APIs).\n\n**Prevention: layered controls**\n1) Bot management / WAF with behavioral scoring  \n- Use bot management that combines ML, fingerprinting, and behavior analysis; these systems are designed to detect automation beyond IP reputation. ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Progressive challenges (not just CAPTCHAs)  \n- Use step‑up friction when risk score crosses a threshold: JS challenges, proof‑of‑work, or additional verification (OTP/2FA). Keep friction minimal for low‑risk traffic.\n\n3) Rate‑limit *by entity*, not just IP  \n- Enforce limits on account, device, session, and API key. IP rotation becomes less useful if the same bot identity or device cluster is throttled.\n\n4) Strong account security  \n- Implement MFA / risk‑based authentication, passwordless options, and login anomaly detection to reduce credential‑stuffing success rates. OWASP Automated Threats highlights credential stuffing as a major automated abuse category.

I’ll keep it vendor‑neutral; where relevant I cite authoritative guidance and common industry controls.\n\n**What proxy rotation attacks look like (2026 context)**\n- High‑volume automated traffic that distributes requests across many IPs (often residential proxies) to evade IP blocks and rate limits; commonly paired with credential stuffing, scraping, inventory hoarding, price arbitrage, or card‑testing. These patterns are covered broadly by OWASP’s Automated Threats project. ([owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Detection: combine signals so IP rotation doesn’t matter**\n1) Behavior & session analytics  \n- Model normal user journeys per endpoint (search → PDP → add‑to‑cart → checkout) and alert on abnormal sequences, unrealistic speeds, or excessive retries. Behavior‑based anomaly detection is a core approach in commercial bot management. ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Device/browser fingerprint consistency  \n- Track stable device signals (JS/DOM features, WebGL, canvas/audio, timezone, language, installed fonts) and detect churn that doesn’t align with legitimate device change.  \n- Watch for implausible combinations (e.g., mobile UA + desktop window sizes + unusual automation artifacts).\n\n3) TLS/HTTP stack fingerprinting  \n- Use TLS/JA3/JA4, HTTP/2 settings, header ordering, and cookie behavior to group bots across rotating IPs. Even when IPs change, the underlying client stack often stays consistent.\n\n4) Residential proxy & proxy‑network detection  \n- Many bot systems can flag traffic from known proxy networks; use those detections to reduce trust scores and apply challenges. Example: Cloudflare exposes detection IDs for residential/proxy traffic. ([developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/detection-ids/additional-detections/?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) Velocity & graph analysis across identifiers  \n- Rate‑limit by **account + device + payment instrument + shipping address + session** (not just IP).  \n- Build link analysis: if hundreds of accounts share a small set of device fingerprints or payment instruments, treat as a coordinated cluster.\n\n6) Per‑endpoint risk scoring  \n- Apply stricter detection to high‑risk endpoints (login, checkout, inventory‑sensitive items, coupon redemption, price‑scraping APIs).\n\n**Prevention: layered controls**\n1) Bot management / WAF with behavioral scoring  \n- Use bot management that combines ML, fingerprinting, and behavior analysis; these systems are designed to detect automation beyond IP reputation. ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2) Progressive challenges (not just CAPTCHAs)  \n- Use step‑up friction when risk score crosses a threshold: JS challenges, proof‑of‑work, or additional verification (OTP/2FA). Keep friction minimal for low‑risk traffic.\n\n3) Rate‑limit *by entity*, not just IP  \n- Enforce limits on account, device, session, and API key. IP rotation becomes less useful if the same bot identity or device cluster is throttled.\n\n4) Strong account security  \n- Implement MFA / risk‑based authentication, passwordless options, and login anomaly detection to reduce credential‑stuffing success rates. OWASP Automated Threats highlights credential stuffing as a major automated abuse category. ([owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/?utm_source=openai))\n\n5) Abuse‑resistant APIs  \n- Require auth for price/inventory endpoints; use per‑client quotas, response shaping, and anomaly alerts.  \n- Instrument endpoints with business‑logic constraints (e.g., cart reservation timeouts, max purchase limits).\n\n6) Logging, detection engineering, and response playbooks  \n- Centralize logs of fingerprint, device, session, and transaction context.  \n- Run continuous detection tuning and allow rapid rule changes during spikes.\n\n**Operational guidance**\n- **Baseline first**: you need a clean “normal traffic” baseline to detect anomalies; bot management platforms rely on this.

([docs.rs](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/relay/client/index.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n**How it works (high level)**\n- Create relay client `Transport` + `Behaviour` via `relay::client::new(...)`.\n- Combine the relay transport with your base transport using `OrTransport`.\n- Build a relayed multiaddr: `<relay_addr>/p2p/<relay_peer>/p2p-circuit/p2p/<dest_peer>`.\n- Dial that multiaddr; the relay client behaviour handles the circuit setup.

([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Minimal REST example (v1beta1)**\n```json\nPOST https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"input\": {\n    \"ssml\": \"<speak>Hello <mark name=\\\"tp1\\\"/> world.</speak>\"\n  },\n  \"voice\": {\n    \"languageCode\": \"en-US\",\n    \"name\": \"en-US-Neural2-F\"\n  },\n  \"audioConfig\": {\n    \"audioEncoding\": \"MP3\"\n  },\n  \"enableTimePointing\": [\"SSML_MARK\"]\n}\n```\nThe response includes `timepoints`:\n```json\n{\n  \"audioContent\": \"...\",\n  \"timepoints\": [\n    { \"markName\": \"tp1\", \"timeSeconds\": 0.53 }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis behavior is documented for v1beta1: `SSML_MARK` enables timepoints from SSML `<mark>` tags, and timepoints are returned as seconds from the start of audio. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Notes / gotchas**\n- Timepoints are **only** supported via `<mark>` in SSML (not plain text input). ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.texttospeech.v1beta1?utm_source=openai))\n- If you don’t set `enable_time_pointing`, **no timepoints are returned**. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml?utm_source=openai))\n- In responses, timepoints are `{ markName, timeSeconds }`.

([github.com](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/2519))  \nFix options:\n- **Upgrade to a patched 1.2.x+** if available in your repo (if you can share the exact version, I can check).  \n- **Temporary patch** similar to the workaround in the issue (handle raw tools when building schemas) if you must stay on 1.2.x. ([github.com](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/2519))  \n\n**3) MCP usage API path changes / correct wiring**  \nCurrent docs show MCP integration via `from livekit.agents import …, mcp` and passing `mcp_servers=[mcp.MCPServerHTTP(url=...)]` to `AgentSession`. If you’re importing from older namespaces, align to this pattern. ([docs.livekit.io](https://docs.livekit.io/recipes/http_mcp_client/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**4) “Can’t update tools after session starts”**  \nAs of Sep 26, 2025, there’s an open issue asking for dynamic MCP tool updates after session start with no documented solution yet. If you need dynamic tools, the safest workaround is to start a new session or maintain multiple sessions. ([github.com](https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/3513?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n**If you want a targeted fix, send:**\n- Exact error and traceback  \n- `livekit-agents` version and plugin versions  \n- Your LLM provider + whether it’s Realtime  \n- A minimal snippet of your `AgentSession` setup  \n\nI’ll map it to the right fix and, if needed, give you a concrete patch.","timestamp":61716}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"LiveKit","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"workspaceDir":"/workspace/runs/prompt-websearch-1891","exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770376665466,"end":1770376727182,"firstResponse":61716,"sessionCreation":0,"total":61716},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.75,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

Here’s a concise, source‑grounded checklist you can apply across stacks.\n\n**Architecture & Data Flow**\n- Prefer incremental/CDC over full reloads; design pipelines to process only new/changed data and avoid reprocessing. AWS Glue job bookmarks and lakehouse formats (e.g., Hudi upserts) exist specifically to support incremental runs. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-continuations.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- Use table formats with ACID + schema enforcement + time‑travel for reproducibility and rollback (e.g., Delta Lake) when your pipeline writes to data lakes. ([docs.delta.io](https://docs.delta.io/index.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- Plan for schema evolution explicitly; use schema registries with compatibility rules to keep producers/consumers safe during changes. ([docs.confluent.io](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/schema-evolution.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Streaming, Exactly‑Once, and Idempotence**\n- Where streaming is required, aim for end‑to‑end exactly‑once semantics where the platform supports it (Kafka Streams supports transactional + idempotent semantics). ([kafka.apache.org](https://kafka.apache.org/20/streams/core-concepts/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Make all pipeline activities idempotent and design for retries to avoid duplicate writes; Azure Data Factory’s reliability guidance emphasizes idempotence + upsert patterns. ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/reliability-data-factory?utm_source=openai))  \n- For messy inputs, route bad records to a dead‑letter queue instead of failing the entire job; Dataflow recommends this for robust batch/streaming pipelines. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/large-pipeline-best-practices?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Storage Layout & Performance**\n- Use columnar formats (Parquet/ORC), partition intelligently, and scale compute based on workload characteristics (AWS Glue best practices). ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/serverless-etl-aws-glue/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- Prefer table formats with hidden partitioning and partition evolution to avoid query brittleness and enable layout changes without breaking downstream logic (Iceberg). ([iceberg.apache.org](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.5.2/partitioning/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Orchestration & Operational Hygiene**\n- Keep tasks stateless and avoid local filesystem dependencies; share data through durable storage and pass only small metadata via orchestration messaging (Airflow). ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- Use built‑in observability and monitoring; AWS Glue exposes CloudWatch metrics/logging and job‑level observability for triage.

([hijiffy.com](https://www.hijiffy.com/resources/articles/hotel-reservation-confirmation?utm_source=openai))\n- Totals should be both global (all rooms) and per‑room, so groups can split payments without confusion. (Inference based on multi‑room complexity; still rooted in the need for clear booking and payment details.) ([hijiffy.com](https://www.hijiffy.com/resources/articles/hotel-reservation-confirmation?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Operational details guests need**\n- Check‑in/out times, property address, and direct contact info (phone/email) with a map or “Directions” button. ([hijiffy.com](https://www.hijiffy.com/resources/articles/hotel-reservation-confirmation?utm_source=openai))\n- Cancellation/modification deadlines stated in plain language and repeated in the room cards and summary. ([hijiffy.com](https://www.hijiffy.com/resources/articles/hotel-reservation-confirmation?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Post‑booking actions (high‑value on confirmation pages)**\n- Primary CTA: “Manage booking” / “View itinerary.” Secondary: “Add to calendar,” “Get directions,” “Contact property.” Confirmation pages are ideal for these non‑order actions. ([baymard.com](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/receipt/12056-nike?utm_source=openai))\n- Download/print receipt and send confirmation email link; guests often check emails to validate bookings. ([baymard.com](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/receipt/12056-nike?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Clarity and scannability**\n- Chunk information into sections: “Stay summary,” “Room 1 / Room 2…,” “Payments,” “Policies,” “Contact.” The core goal is fast verification. ([baymard.com](https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/receipt/12056-nike?utm_source=openai))\n- Mobile‑first layout with short blocks and obvious headings; confirmation details are frequently retrieved on phones.
