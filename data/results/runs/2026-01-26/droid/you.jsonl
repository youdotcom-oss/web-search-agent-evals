I found the exact usage of the `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` custom error. Here's a comprehensive summary of my findings:\n\n## LI.FI `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` Custom Error - Summary\n\n### Definition\nThe `CannotBridgeToSameNetwork` error is defined in LI.FI's smart contracts at:\n- **File**: `src/Errors/GenericErrors.sol` (version 1.0.2)\n- **License**: LGPL-3.0-only\n- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.17\n\n```solidity\nerror CannotBridgeToSameNetwork();\n```\n\n### Purpose\nThis custom error is used in LI.FI's cross-chain bridge aggregation protocol to prevent users from attempting to bridge tokens to the same network they are already on, which would be a meaningless operation.\n\n### Usage Location\nThe error is used in the `Validatable.sol` helper contract through a modifier called `validateBridgeData`:\n\n```solidity\nmodifier validateBridgeData(ILiFi.BridgeData memory _bridgeData) {\n    if (LibUtil.isZeroAddress(_bridgeData.receiver)) {\n        revert InvalidReceiver();\n    }\n    if (_bridgeData.minAmount == 0) {\n        revert InvalidAmount();\n    }\n    if (_bridgeData.destinationChainId == block.chainid) {\n        revert CannotBridgeToSameNetwork();\n    }\n    _;\n}\n```\n\n### Context\n- **Architecture**: LI.FI uses the EIP-2535 Diamond (Multi-Facet Proxy) standard\n- **Facets**: Business logic is split across multiple facet contracts (HopFacet, CBridgeFacet, StargateFacet, etc.)\n- **Validation**: The `Validatable` contract is inherited by facets to validate bridge data before executing cross-chain operations\n\n### Other Generic Errors in the Same File\nThe `GenericErrors.sol` file contains 38 other custom errors including:\n- `InvalidReceiver()`\n- `InvalidAmount()`\n- `InvalidDestinationChain()`\n- `NativeAssetNotSupported()`\n- `InsufficientBalance(uint256 required, uint256 balance)`\n- `ReentrancyError()`\n- `UnAuthorized()`\n- And more...\n\n### Gas Efficiency\nCustom errors in Solidity (introduced in v0.8.4) are more gas-efficient than `require` with string messages because they use the error selector (4 bytes) rather than encoding the entire error string.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: LiFi facets CannotBridgeToSameNetwork custom error Solidity 2026</web-search>","timestamp":46114},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":46114},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01ECNfVkBCzsfVKbk1x7nU27","status":"completed","timestamp":46114},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search, I found information about LI.FI (LiFi) smart contracts and their facet architecture.

This happens because:\n\n- Google only indexes videos that are on **dedicated \"watch pages\"** where the video is the **primary content**\n- Blog posts with embedded videos are considered \"normal pages\" - the video is supplementary, not the main focus\n- Google's guideline: *\"A watch page's main purpose is to show a user a single video; only videos that are on a watch page are eligible for indexing\"*\n\n## Solutions (2024-2025)\n\n### 1. **Create Dedicated Watch Pages**\nThe most effective solution is to create a separate landing page for each video:\n- The page should feature **only the video** as the main content\n- Include minimal supporting text (title, brief description)\n- Link back to the original blog post\n- In your blog post, replace the embed with a **clickable thumbnail** that links to the watch page\n\n### 2. **Add Video Structured Data (Schema Markup)**\nAdd `VideoObject` schema to help Google understand your video content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Video description here\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-03-14T00:00:00+00:00Z\",\n  \"duration\": \"PT07M07S\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/hqdefault.jpg\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/v/VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Use SEO Plugins** (WordPress)\n- Yoast SEO or RankMath can automatically add video schema\n- Some plugins can create watch pages automatically\n\n### 4. **Limit One Video Per Watch Page**\nIf you have multiple videos on one page, Google won't know which one to index.

This happens because:\n\n- Google only indexes videos that are on **dedicated \"watch pages\"** where the video is the **primary content**\n- Blog posts with embedded videos are considered \"normal pages\" - the video is supplementary, not the main focus\n- Google's guideline: *\"A watch page's main purpose is to show a user a single video; only videos that are on a watch page are eligible for indexing\"*\n\n## Solutions (2024-2025)\n\n### 1. **Create Dedicated Watch Pages**\nThe most effective solution is to create a separate landing page for each video:\n- The page should feature **only the video** as the main content\n- Include minimal supporting text (title, brief description)\n- Link back to the original blog post\n- In your blog post, replace the embed with a **clickable thumbnail** that links to the watch page\n\n### 2. **Add Video Structured Data (Schema Markup)**\nAdd `VideoObject` schema to help Google understand your video content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Video description here\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-03-14T00:00:00+00:00Z\",\n  \"duration\": \"PT07M07S\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/hqdefault.jpg\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/v/VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Use SEO Plugins** (WordPress)\n- Yoast SEO or RankMath can automatically add video schema\n- Some plugins can create watch pages automatically\n\n### 4. **Limit One Video Per Watch Page**\nIf you have multiple videos on one page, Google won't know which one to index. Each video needs its own dedicated page.\n\n### 5. **Accept the Limitation**\nFor blog posts where video is truly supplementary:\n- This \"error\" is actually **expected behavior**, not a problem\n- The blog post itself can still be indexed normally\n- The video will still be indexed on YouTube's platform\n- Don't waste time trying to get embedded YouTube videos \"double indexed\"\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nIf video SEO is important to your business, create dedicated watch pages.

Let me get more specific documentation from the HTTPX extensions page:\nNow I have comprehensive information about HTTPX trace callbacks. Here's a summary of what I found:\n\n## HTTPX Trace Callback for Response Headers Timing and TTFB Calculation\n\nThe HTTPX library provides a **trace extension** that allows you to monitor internal HTTP events, which can be used to compute TTFB (Time to First Byte).\n\n### Key Events for TTFB Calculation\n\nThe trace callback receives events in the format:\n- `{event_type}.{event_name}.started` - with keyword arguments\n- `{event_type}.{event_name}.complete` - with return value\n- `{event_type}.{event_name}.failed` - with exception\n\n**Relevant events for TTFB:**\n- `http11.send_request_headers.started/complete` - When request headers are sent\n- `http11.receive_response_headers.started/complete` - When response headers are received (this is your \"first byte\" moment!)\n\n### Example: Computing TTFB with HTTPX Trace Callback\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\nclass TTFBTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.request_sent_time = None\n        self.response_headers_received_time = None\n        self.ttfb = None\n    \n    def trace_callback(self, event_name, info):\n        # Mark when request headers are fully sent\n        if event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.complete\":\n            self.request_sent_time = time.perf_counter()\n        \n        # Mark when response headers start being received (TTFB)\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            self.response_headers_received_time = time.perf_counter()\n            if self.request_sent_time:\n                self.ttfb = self.response_headers_received_time - self.request_sent_time\n            # Access response headers from info\n            # info['return_value'] = (version, status_code, reason, headers)\n            version, status, reason, headers = info['return_value']\n            print(f\"Response Headers: {headers}\")\n\n# Usage\ntracker = TTFBTracker()\nclient = httpx.Client()\nresponse = client.get(\n    \"https://www.example.com/\",\n    extensions={\"trace\": tracker.trace_callback}\n)\nprint(f\"TTFB: {tracker.ttfb:.4f} seconds\")\n```\n\n### Async Version\n\n```python\nimport httpx\nimport time\n\nclass AsyncTTFBTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.request_sent_time = None\n        self.ttfb = None\n    \n    async def trace_callback(self, event_name, info):\n        if event_name == \"http11.send_request_headers.complete\":\n            self.request_sent_time = time.perf_counter()\n        elif event_name == \"http11.receive_response_headers.complete\":\n            if self.request_sent_time:\n                self.ttfb = time.perf_counter() - self.request_sent_time\n\n# Usage\nasync def main():\n    tracker = AsyncTTFBTracker()\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        response = await client.get(\n            \"https://www.example.com/\",\n            extensions={\"trace\": tracker.trace_callback}\n        )\n    print(f\"TTFB: {tracker.ttfb:.4f} seconds\")\n```\n\n### HTTP/2 Events\nFor HTTP/2 connections, use these events instead:\n- `http2.send_request_headers.complete`\n- `http2.receive_response_headers.complete`\n\n### Response Headers in Trace Callback\nThe `http11.receive_response_headers.complete` event provides the response headers in `info['return_value']` as a tuple:\n```python\n(version, status_code, reason_phrase, headers_list)\n# Example: (b'HTTP/1.1', 200, b'OK', [(b'Content-Type', b'text/html'), ...])\n```","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: httpx trace callback response headers timing example compute ttfb python 2026</web-search>","timestamp":26506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":26506},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01EzJhE2wNuxZQuXzzDdxjwn","status":"completed","timestamp":26506},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, I found relevant information about HTTPX trace callbacks and TTFB measurement.

Accuracy seems high based on general knowledge, but detailed verification is outside my current capability.","metadata":{"expectedMcp":true,"mcpToolCalled":true,"deterministicScore":60,"llmScore":35,"hasErrors":false,"hasTimeout":false}}}

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Vertex AI Bounding Box Detection - Key Information\n\n### Core Features (from Google Cloud documentation - updated Jan 2026):\n\n1. **Output Format**: Bounding boxes are returned in `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]` format with coordinates normalized to 0-1000 for every image. The top left corner is the origin.\n\n2. **Customizable Detection**: You can produce bounding boxes based on custom natural language instructions (e.g., \"I want to see bounding boxes of all the green objects in this image\") without training a custom model.\n\n3. **Input/Output**: The system accepts prompts with associated images or video frames and returns localization data.\n\n### Prompt Engineering Techniques:\n\n1. **Google Skills Badge Course**: Google offers a \"Prompt Design in Vertex AI\" skill badge covering:\n   - Prompt engineering fundamentals\n   - Image analysis techniques\n   - Multimodal generative techniques with Gemini models\n\n2. **Medical Imaging Specific - MedGemma 1.5** (January 2026):\n   - Google released MedGemma 1.5 through their Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF) program\n   - These models are specifically designed for medical image interpretation\n   - Available on Hugging Face and can be deployed/adapted on Vertex AI\n   - Includes the MedSigLIP image encoder for medical imaging tasks\n   - Free for research and commercial use\n\n### For Medical Imaging Applications:\n\n1. **3D Bounding Box Detection** (from academic research):\n   - Current methods focus on Deep Learning approaches (CNNs) vs. manual feature engineering\n   - Both 2D and 3D implementations are used for localizing anatomical structures in volumetric medical image data\n\n2. **Image Segmentation on Vertex AI**:\n   - More sophisticated than bounding box detection\n   - Draws precise outlines around detected objects (pixel-level accuracy)\n   - Useful when exact boundaries matter more than rectangular bounding boxes\n\n### Getting Started:\n- Use Vertex AI Studio to design, test, and manage prompts for Gemini models\n- Access through Model Garden with first-party (Gemini, Imagen), third-party (Claude), and open models (Gemma, Llama)\n- For medical use cases, consider starting with MedGemma as a foundation model\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of this information?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Vertex AI bounding box detection prompt engineering techniques medical imaging 2026</web-search>","timestamp":18518},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":18518},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_011aeW1uCRVqYewwMnmJeJia","status":"completed","timestamp":18518},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my web search, I found comprehensive information about Vertex AI bounding box detection and prompt engineering techniques relevant to medical imaging.

Most commonly used inset type\n   - Represents where system UI displays above your app (Z-axis)\n   - Use to move/pad tappable views away from system bars\n\n2. **System Gesture Insets**\n   - Bottom inset for home gesture\n   - Left and right insets for back gestures (Android 10+)\n   - Use for swipeable views, bottom sheets, carousels, ViewPager2\n\n3. **Safe Insets** (Jetpack Compose)\n   - `WindowInsets.safeDrawing` - prevents visual overlap\n   - `WindowInsets.safeGestures` - prevents gesture conflicts\n   - `WindowInsets.safeContent` - combination of both\n\n4. **Display Cutout Insets** - for notches and device-specific screen cutouts\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Avoid placing interactions under gesture insets** - Don't add touch targets under gesture navigation areas\n\n2. **Handle insets programmatically**:\n   ```kotlin\n   ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(view) { view, windowInsets ->\n       val insets = windowInsets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())\n       view.updatePadding(\n           top = insets.top,\n           bottom = insets.bottom\n       )\n       WindowInsetsCompat.CONSUMED\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **For transparent 3-button navigation**: Set `window.isNavigationBarContrastEnforced = false` (this property doesn't affect gesture navigation)\n\n4. **Gesture navigation UI**: Shows a single gesture handle -

The `interrupt()` Function\nImport from `langgraph.types`:\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\n```\n\nWhen called within a node, `interrupt()`:\n- Pauses graph execution\n- Saves the current graph state using the persistence layer\n- Returns a value to the caller (accessible via `__interrupt__` in the result)\n- Waits indefinitely until you resume execution\n\n### 2. Resuming with `Command(resume=...)`\n\nAfter an interrupt pauses execution, resume the graph by invoking it with a `Command` containing the resume value:\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import Command\n\n# Initial run - hits the interrupt and pauses\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"thread-1\"}}\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": \"data\"}, config=config)\n\n# Check what was interrupted\nprint(result[\"__interrupt__\"])  # [Interrupt(value='Do you approve this action?')]\n\n# Resume with the human's response\ngraph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)\n```\n\n### 3. Basic Example Pattern\n\n```python\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt, Command\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    user_feedback: str\n\ndef human_feedback(state):\n    print(\"---Waiting for human feedback---\")\n    # This pauses execution and waits for input\n    feedback = interrupt(\"Please provide feedback:\")\n    return {\"user_feedback\": feedback}\n\n# Build graph with checkpointer\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\nbuilder.add_node(\"human_feedback\", human_feedback)\n# ... add other nodes and edges\n\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\ngraph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n\n# Run until interrupt\nthread = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\nfor event in graph.stream({\"input\": \"data\"}, thread, stream_mode=\"updates\"):\n    print(event)\n\n# Resume with user input\nfor event in graph.stream(Command(resume=\"user's response\"), thread, stream_mode=\"updates\"):\n    print(event)\n```\n\n### 4. Approval Pattern with Routing\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Literal\n\ndef approval_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"proceed\", \"cancel\"]]:\n    # Pause execution; payload shows up under result[\"__interrupt__\"]\n    is_approved = interrupt({\n        \"question\": \"Do you want to proceed with this action?\",\n        \"details\": state[\"action_details\"]\n    })\n    \n    # Route based on the response\n    if is_approved:\n        return Command(goto=\"proceed\")\n    else:\n        return Command(goto=\"cancel\")\n```\n\n## Important Requirements\n\n1. **Checkpointer is required**: You must set up a checkpointer (like `InMemorySaver` or a database-backed one) to save the graph's state\n2. **Thread ID**: You must provide a `thread_id` in the config to associate execution with a conversation thread\n3. **Same thread ID for resume**: Use the same thread ID when resuming to continue from the saved checkpoint\n\n## Common HITL Patterns\n\n- **Approval/Rejection**: Pause before critical actions (API calls, database changes)\n- **Review/Edit**: Allow humans to review and modify agent outputs\n- **User Input Collection**: Gather clarifying information from users\n- **Tool Call Review**: Require human approval before executing tool calls\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Don't wrap `interrupt()` calls in try/except blocks\n2. Ensure side effects before interrupts are idempotent\n3. Don't reorder interrupt calls within a node\n4. Keep only one task in_progress at a time when handling multiple interrupts\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific examples or dive deeper into any particular aspect of LangGraph interrupts?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">How do I find information about: LangGraph human interrupt resume how to use Python HumanInterrupt interrupt types Command resume 2026?</web-search>","timestamp":35229},{"type":"tool_call","name":"WebSearch","status":"pending","timestamp":35229},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":35229},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019QywmMHbgfAUrQykdR5NNY","status":"completed","timestamp":35229},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_0144yg3ULf9ERfVWbXaJkED5","status":"completed","timestamp":35229},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here's a comprehensive overview of **LangGraph Human Interrupt and Resume** functionality in Python:\n\n## Overview\n\nLangGraph's `interrupt()` function enables **human-in-the-loop (HITL)** workflows by pausing graph execution at specific points and waiting for external input before continuing.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1.

Keep only one task in_progress at a time when handling multiple interrupts\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific examples or dive deeper into any particular aspect of LangGraph interrupts?","timestamp":35229}],"metadata":{"category":"Integration","subcategory":"LangGraph","lang":"Python","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcp_server":"ydc-server","expected_tools":["you-search","you-express"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769458340050,"end":1769458375279,"firstResponse":35229,"sessionCreation":0,"total":35229},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":false,"score":0.6,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).

Use `spawn` start method instead of `fork`\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nmp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)\n```\n\n#### 2. Use `SimpleQueue` instead of `Queue`\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import SimpleQueue\n# SimpleQueue doesn't use additional threads, avoiding deadlock issues\n```\n\n#### 3. Load models before spawning processes\n```python\n# Load the model in the main process BEFORE spawning\nmodel = torch.load('model.pt')\nmodel.share_memory()  # Make it accessible to child processes\n# Then spawn processes\n```\n\n#### 4. Use `DistributedDataParallel` instead of manual multiprocessing\n```python\n# Recommended by PyTorch documentation\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\n```\n\n#### 5. For HuggingFace Transformers specifically\n```python\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nmp.set_start_method('spawn')\n\n# Use spawn context explicitly\nwith mp.get_context('spawn').Pool(processes=num_gpus) as pool:\n    # Your parallel code\n```\n\n#### 6. Map model to CPU before loading in subprocess\n```python\nstate_dict = torch.load('model.pt', map_location='cpu')\nmodel.load_state_dict(state_dict)\nmodel.to(device)  # Move to GPU after loading\n```\n\n#### 7. Add timeout handling for spawn\n```python\n# Use timeout with process.join() to avoid indefinite hanging\nfor p in processes:\n    p.join(timeout=300)  # 5 minute timeout\n    if p.is_alive():\n        p.terminate()\n```\n\n### Best Practices from PyTorch Documentation (v2.10)\n\n1. **Prefer `DistributedDataParallel`** over manual multiprocessing or `DataParallel`\n2. **Use `multiprocessing.Queue`** for passing PyTorch objects between processes (handles shared memory automatically)\n3. **Avoid forking** when background threads might be running\n4. **Be cautious with inherited shared memory tensors** - use Queues instead for safety\n\n### References\n- [PyTorch Multiprocessing Best Practices](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/multiprocessing.html)\n- [GitHub Issue #41694](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/41694) - spawn deadlock discussion\n- [PyTorch Forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/load-state-dict-causing-deadlock-in-multiprocessing-training/191333) - load_state_dict deadlock","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: PyTorch model loading multiprocessing stuck deadlock solution 2026</web-search>","timestamp":22770},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":22770},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01MKDoEDRzFc8hjNHGpktzCr","status":"completed","timestamp":22770},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about PyTorch model loading multiprocessing deadlock issues and solutions.\n\n## PyTorch Model Loading Multiprocessing Deadlock: Causes and Solutions\n\n### Common Causes of Deadlocks\n\n1. **Background threads holding locks during fork**: When `fork` is called and a thread holds a lock or imports a module, the subprocess can be in a corrupted state and deadlock.\n\n2. **`load_state_dict` in multiprocessing context**: Loading model state dictionaries can cause deadlocks when done in spawned processes.\n\n3. **Complex Queue implementations**: `multiprocessing.Queue` spawns multiple threads for serialization that can cause deadlocks.\n\n4. **Large parameter copying**: When copying large model parameters between processes, deadlocks can occur.\n\n### Solutions\n\n#### 1.

Basic `background-clip: text` Setup\nThe `background-clip: text` property clips a background (including gradients) to the shape of the text itself. The basic pattern is:\n\n```css\n.gradient-text {\n  background: radial-gradient(circle, #ff6b6b, #4ecdc4);\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n  background-clip: text;\n  color: transparent; /* or use rgba with low opacity */\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Hover Transitions with Gradients\nSince CSS cannot directly animate gradients, there are several workarounds for hover effects:\n\n**Option A: Opacity-based transition using pseudo-elements**\n```css\n.text-link {\n  position: relative;\n  background: linear-gradient(#333, #333);\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n  background-clip: text;\n  color: transparent;\n}\n\n.text-link::before {\n  content: attr(data-text);\n  position: absolute;\n  background: radial-gradient(circle at center, #ff6b6b, #4ecdc4);\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n  background-clip: text;\n  color: transparent;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.text-link:hover::before {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n```\n\n**Option B: Background-position animation**\n```css\n.animated-gradient-text {\n  background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 0% 50%, #ff6b6b, #4ecdc4, #ff6b6b);\n  background-size: 200% 100%;\n  -webkit-background-clip: text;\n  background-clip: text;\n  color: transparent;\n  transition: background-position 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.animated-gradient-text:hover {\n  background-position: 100% 50%;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Multiple Backgrounds with Different Clip Regions\nYou can layer backgrounds with different clip values:\n```css\n.layered-text {\n  background: \n    radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.2), transparent),\n    linear-gradient(90deg, #ff6b6b, #4ecdc4);\n  background-clip: padding-box, text;\n  -webkit-background-clip: padding-box, text;\n  color: transparent;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Accessibility Considerations (2025/2026 best practices)\n- Use `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion\n- Ensure text communicates meaning without relying solely on color/gradient\n- Add hover/focus styles that don't rely only on color changes\n\n### Browser Support\nAs of 2026, `background-clip: text` is well-supported across modern browsers, though the `-webkit-` prefix is still recommended for Safari compatibility.\n\nWould you like me to create a working example file demonstrating any of these techniques?","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: css background-clip text with radial gradient overlay hover effect 2026</web-search>","timestamp":18336},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":18336},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HjeB1mbozkap8XqpNXSD1D","status":"completed","timestamp":18336},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search results, here's what I found about CSS `background-clip: text` with radial gradient overlay hover effects:\n\n## Key Techniques for CSS Text Gradient with Hover Effects\n\n### 1.

He released it publicly on the App Store on **New Year's Day 2022**. What started as a small act of love turned into one of the most viral apps ever.\n\n### Key Marketing Strategy Elements\n\n1. **TikTok-First Viral Growth**: Locket's explosive growth came primarily from TikTok. A walkthrough video of the app went viral on the platform, propelling it to the #1 spot on the App Store.

He released it publicly on the App Store on **New Year's Day 2022**. What started as a small act of love turned into one of the most viral apps ever.\n\n### Key Marketing Strategy Elements\n\n1. **TikTok-First Viral Growth**: Locket's explosive growth came primarily from TikTok. A walkthrough video of the app went viral on the platform, propelling it to the #1 spot on the App Store.

Solution: `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` on the label.\n\n3. **Double event firing**: If both `onClick` on a container and `onChange` on input exist, clicking the label can trigger both events due to HTML's automatic click forwarding from labels to inputs.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n```jsx\n// Correct pattern\n<div>\n  <input \n    type=\"checkbox\" \n    id={`checkbox-${index}`}\n    checked={isChecked}\n    onChange={handleChange}\n  />\n  <label htmlFor={`checkbox-${index}`}>{label}</label>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Common Solutions\n\n1. **Use `htmlFor` correctly**: Make sure the `htmlFor` value matches the input's `id`.\n\n2. **For hidden checkboxes with styled labels**: Add `onClick` to the label instead of `onChange` on the input when styling custom checkboxes.\n\n3. **Prevent event bubbling**: When a parent container has an `onClick`, use `e.stopPropagation()` on the label.\n\n4. **Using a wrapper `<label>`**: If wrapping both input and text in a `<label>`, no `htmlFor` is needed but be aware of event bubbling.\n\nThe project doesn't appear to have any checkbox components currently - it's primarily an image slider.

search results, here's a timeline of the ISW-documented Huliaipole offensive by Russian forces in late 2025:\n\n## ISW Huliaipole Offensive Timeline (December 2025)\n\n### Background\n- The Huliaipole sector had been one of the most stable parts of the frontline since the early months of the full-scale invasion in 2022\n- In late 2025, Russian forces changed approach by advancing **westwards from Donetsk Oblast** rather than directly from the south\n- **November 2025**: Russia began a noticeable advance towards Huliaipole and Oleksandrivka\n\n### December 2025 Timeline\n\n**Early December 2025:**\n- Russian forces began operations in Huliaipole proper\n- ISW assessed that Russia achieved a **tactical breakthrough northeast and east of Hulyaipole in mid-November 2025** by concentrating forces comparable in size to those in the Pokrovsk-Dobropillya direction\n\n**December 4, 2025:**\n- ISW reported Russia's breakthrough came from **months of preparation**, not sudden Ukrainian collapse\n- Moscow had shifted airborne units from Sumy and brigades from across the front to build strength\n- Ukrainian counterattacks were slowing the advance\n\n**December 18, 2025:**\n- Geolocated footage showed Russian advances in **eastern Hulyaipole** and **central Varvarivka** (northwest of Hulyaipole)\n\n**December 22-23, 2025:**\n- Russian troops entered the **center of Huliaipole** with fierce fighting\n- Russians captured further areas to the south and north of the town\n- Western part of the city remained under Ukrainian control\n- Reports of defense coordination problems between Ukrainian units\n\n**December 24, 2025:**\n- Geolocated footage showed Russian advances in **southern Hulyaipole**\n- Russian forces advanced to the **T-0401 Pokrovske-Hulyaipole highway** in Varvarivka\n\n**December 25, 2025:**\n- Russian forces captured a **Ukrainian battalion command post** in central Huliaipole\n- Laptops still running, unlocked smartphone, and official seals were seized\n- The 1st Battalion's withdrawal exposed the flank of the 2nd Battalion (102nd TDF Brigade)\n- Russian forces advanced from Marfopil and Huliaipole's northeastern outskirts\n\n### Key Context\n- By late 2025, only ~500 civilians remained in Huliaipole (per Governor Ivan Fedorov)\n- ISW noted Russian claims about advances were \"purposely exaggerated\" and that Russian military leaders routinely receive false reports from the ground\n- Ukrainian counterattacks near Sosnivka pushed back elements of Russia's 36th Army and helped maintain positions on the Vorona-Vovcha river line","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: ISW Huliaipole offensive December 2025 Russian forces capture

Attempting to do so results in:\n\n```python\nsqlalchemy.exc.ObjectNotExecutableError: Not an executable object: 'SELECT 1'\n```\n\n### The Cause\n\nSQLAlchemy 2.0 introduced a breaking change where the `execute()` method no longer accepts plain string SQL statements. The string object lacks the `_execute_on_connection` attribute that SQLAlchemy 2.x requires for execution.\n\n### The Solution\n\nYou must wrap raw SQL strings with `text()` from SQLAlchemy:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\n# Old way (SQLAlchemy 1.x) - NO LONGER WORKS in 2.x\nconnection.execute(\"SELECT 1\")  # ❌ Raises ObjectNotExecutableError\n\n# New way (SQLAlchemy 2.x) - REQUIRED\nconnection.execute(text(\"SELECT 1\"))  # ✅ Works correctly\n```\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\n**1. Simple queries:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nresult = connection.execute(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\"))\n```\n\n**2. Parameterized queries:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nquery = text(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id\")\nresult = connection.execute(query, {\"user_id\": 12})\n```\n\n**3. With pandas `read_sql()`:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# This also requires text() in SQLAlchemy 2.x\ndf = pd.read_sql(text(\"SELECT * FROM users\"), con=connection)\n```\n\n**4. With Flask-SQLAlchemy:**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import text\n\nresult = db.session.execute(text(\"SELECT name, price FROM products\"))\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Always use `text()`** when executing raw SQL strings in SQLAlchemy 2.x\n2. This applies to all execution contexts: `engine.execute()`, `connection.execute()`, `session.execute()`\n3. The `text()` function creates a `TextClause` object that SQLAlchemy can properly execute\n4.

This feature allows you to get timestamps for `<mark>` tags placed in SSML input, which is useful for synchronizing effects, highlighting words, or triggering events during speech playback.\n\n### How to Use It\n\n**Python Example:**\n```python\nfrom google.cloud.texttospeech_v1beta1 import (\n    VoiceSelectionParams, \n    AudioConfig, \n    AudioEncoding, \n    SynthesizeSpeechRequest, \n    SynthesisInput, \n    TextToSpeechClient\n)\n\nclient = TextToSpeechClient()\n\nsynthesis_input = SynthesisInput(\n    ssml=\"<speak><mark name=\\\"1st\\\"/>Hello <mark name=\\\"2nd\\\"/>world</speak>\"\n)\n\nvoice = VoiceSelectionParams(\n    language_code='en-US', \n    name='en-US-Wavenet-D', \n    ssml_gender='MALE'\n)\n\naudio_config = AudioConfig(audio_encoding=AudioEncoding.MP3)\n\nrequest = SynthesizeSpeechRequest(\n    input=synthesis_input, \n    voice=voice, \n    audio_config=audio_config, \n    enable_time_pointing=[SynthesizeSpeechRequest.TimepointType.SSML_MARK]\n)\n\nresponse = client.synthesize_speech(request=request)\ntimepoints = list(response.timepoints)\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Must use v1beta1**: Import from `google.cloud.texttospeech_v1beta1`, not the stable v1 API\n\n2. **Requires SSML input**: Plain text won't work - you must use SSML with `<mark>` tags\n\n3. **Use SynthesizeSpeechRequest object**: Don't pass `enableTimePointing` as a keyword argument; instead create a full `SynthesizeSpeechRequest` object with `enable_time_pointing` parameter\n\n4. **TimepointType enum values**:\n   - `TIMEPOINT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED` (0) - No timepoint information returned\n   - `SSML_MARK` (1) - Returns timepoint information for `<mark>` tags in SSML\n\n### Known Issues (as of 2023)\nThere was a reported bug where the API would only return timepoints until the first period in the text, rather than all marks. This may have been fixed in subsequent updates.\n\n### REST API Endpoint\n```\nPOST https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize\n```\n\n### Documentation References\n- REST API: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/text/synthesize\n- SSML Documentation: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml (Last updated 2026-01-22)\n- Release Notes: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/release-notes (Last updated 2026-01-22)\n\nThe feature remains in beta (v1beta1) as of January 2026.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"<web-search mcp-server=\"ydc-server\">Find current information about: Google Cloud TTS v1beta1 enable_time_pointing TimepointType.SSML_MARK 2026</web-search>","timestamp":20326},{"type":"tool_call","name":"ydc-server___you-search","status":"pending","timestamp":20326},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01DMZwkUcmK56jwKELdpWWuc","status":"completed","timestamp":20326},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my search, here's the current information about Google Cloud TTS v1beta1 `enable_time_pointing` with `TimepointType.SSML_MARK`:\n\n## Google Cloud Text-to-Speech v1beta1 - Time Pointing with SSML_MARK\n\n### Overview\nThe `enable_time_pointing` feature with `TimepointType.SSML_MARK` is available in the **v1beta1** version of Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.

In Nigerian traditional medicine and local languages:\n\n- **Typhoid fever** in Yoruba is called \"Iba Ponju-ponto\" or \"Iba pupa\"\n- There is no widely documented Hausa vernacular term specifically for typhoid that relates to \"tari\"\n\n### Healthcare Context in Nigeria (2024-2026)\n\nTyphoid fever remains a significant public health challenge in Nigeria:\n- Nigeria has the highest burden of typhoid fever reports in Africa (158 articles in systematic reviews)\n- There is widespread **misdiagnosis** of typhoid fever due to over-reliance on the Widal test, which is unreliable in endemic regions\n- Many patients with other febrile illnesses are incorrectly diagnosed with typhoid\n- Traditional medicine (\"Maganin Gargajiya\") plays a significant role in Nigerian healthcare, with about 80 different medicinal plants used in Lagos State alone for treating typhoid fever\n\n### Possible Confusion or Misconception\n\nIf there is a belief that \"tari\" relates to typhoid, this could stem from:\n1. **Symptom overlap**: While typhoid primarily causes sustained fever, abdominal symptoms, and headache, respiratory symptoms including cough can sometimes accompany typhoid fever in some cases\n2. **Misdiagnosis**: The widespread misdiagnosis of febrile illnesses as typhoid in Nigeria (documented since 1990) could lead to terminology confusion\n3. **Co-infection**: Malaria-typhoid co-infection is common in Nigeria, and various febrile illnesses may share overlapping symptoms\n\n### Summary\n\n**\"Tari\" = Cough in Hausa**, not typhoid. There is no established medical or linguistic connection between this term and typhoid fever in Nigerian healthcare literature or Hausa medical terminology.

Irradiated human cell lines\n   - Mouse cell lines (B3T3 and L929)\n   - Public human pulmonary fibrosis datasets\n\n### 2026 Updates in the Field:\n\n- The combination of radiation + immunotherapy continues to be actively researched for lung cancers\n- New bispecific antibodies like **tarlatamab** (targeting DLL3) are being integrated into SCLC treatment\n- Studies continue to explore optimal sequencing of radiation and immunotherapy to minimize lung toxicity while maximizing efficacy\n- A January 2026 review on \"Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer\" was recently published in Frontiers in Immunology\n\nThe dataset is publicly available on GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and has been used as a reference for understanding radiation-induced lung injury mechanisms.","timestamp":20746}],"metadata":{"category":"Research","subcategory":"Bioinformatics","lang":"R","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcp_server":"ydc-server","expected_tools":["you-search","you-express"],"agent":"droid","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769460158375,"end":1769460179121,"firstResponse":20746,"sessionCreation":0,"total":20746},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":false,"score":0.6,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/60 (content=true, tools=true).
