Motion should enhance comprehension, not just add visual flair.\n\n**Dark Mode Support**\nHigh-contrast themes are mainstream, with brands offering both light and dark mode versions for better accessibility and reduced eye strain.\n\n## Pricing Table Design\n\n**Strategic Priority**\nPricing pages are the second most visited page after homepages and require special attention as part of the conversion strategy.\n\n**Responsive Considerations**\nPricing tables must adapt seamlessly across devices, with simplified layouts for mobile that maintain clarity and comparison functionality.\n\n## Typography & Hierarchy\n\n**Oversized, Expressive Fonts**\nExpect bold, large typography paired with concise, high-impact headlines.

Canvas fingerprinting uses HTML5 Canvas API to draw invisible graphics, with rendering differences based on hardware and drivers.

{"id":"websearch-83","input":"<web-search>Find current information about: RAG system intent classification vs direct retrieval best practices 2026</web-search>","output":"Based on the latest research and industry practices in 2026, here's what I found about RAG system intent classification versus direct retrieval:\n\n## Key Insights\n\n**Intent Classification Advantages:**\n- RAG-enhanced intent classification (REIC) dynamically retrieves relevant examples to handle unseen intents, surpassing static few-shot approaches\n- Enables precise classification without frequent retraining by leveraging dynamic knowledge incorporation\n- Better handles diverse and evolving intent spaces with improved precision and recall\n\n**Traditional Direct Retrieval Limitations:**\n- Fails to translate fine-grained user intent and knowledge source specifications into precise search queries\n- Struggles with \"system-level specifications\" that include full user context, metadata schemas, and retrieval success criteria\n- Keyword-based matching often misses contextual relevance\n\n## 2026 Best Practices\n\n**1. Intelligent Intent Understanding Layer**\nBuild an intermediate service layer that understands agent intent and dynamically coordinates retrieval requests to different data sources based on context assembly strategies.\n\n**2. Contextual Relevance Over Keywords**\nUse reranking stages that leverage full user instruction context to boost documents matching intent, even with weaker keyword matches. Prioritize based on recency or document types rather than just text similarity.\n\n**3. Hybrid Approaches**\nCombine contextual memory with sophisticated retrieval.

Intelligent Intent Understanding Layer**\nBuild an intermediate service layer that understands agent intent and dynamically coordinates retrieval requests to different data sources based on context assembly strategies.\n\n**2. Contextual Relevance Over Keywords**\nUse reranking stages that leverage full user instruction context to boost documents matching intent, even with weaker keyword matches. Prioritize based on recency or document types rather than just text similarity.\n\n**3. Hybrid Approaches**\nCombine contextual memory with sophisticated retrieval. Integration of RAG and fine-tuned LLMs provides greater flexibility and handles diverse query types including semantic queries, keyword matching for tools, parameter matching, and associative queries on memory.\n\n**4.

{"id":"websearch-212","input":"<web-search>Find current information about: Docker bypass UFW firewall solution 2024 container internal network external traffic</web-search>","output":"Based on the search results, here's the current state of Docker's UFW firewall bypass issue and solutions:\n\n## The Problem\n\nDocker bypasses UFW firewall rules because it manipulates iptables directly in the `nat` table, routing traffic before it reaches UFW's INPUT/OUTPUT chains. This means published container ports are accessible externally even if you've explicitly blocked them with UFW.\n\n## Current Solutions (2024-2025)\n\n### 1. **DOCKER-USER Chain (Recommended)**\n\nDocker provides a special `DOCKER-USER` iptables chain that executes before Docker's own rules.

Add rules to `/etc/ufw/after.rules`:\n\n```\n*filter\n:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]\n:ufw-user-input - [0:0]\n\n-A DOCKER-USER -j ufw-user-input\n-A DOCKER-USER -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n-A DOCKER-USER -s 172.16.0.0/12 -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j ACCEPT\n-A DOCKER-USER -j DROP\n\nCOMMIT\n```\n\nThis forces Docker traffic through UFW's filters while allowing internal container communication.\n\n### 2. **ufw-docker Tool**\n\nAutomated solution that links UFW chains into DOCKER-USER: https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker\n\n### 3. **Bind to Localhost**\n\nFor containers that don't need external access, bind ports to loopback:\n```\n-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080\n```\n\n### 4. **UFW Route Commands**\n\nFor container traffic, use `ufw route allow` instead of `ufw allow` since container traffic is routed, not locally delivered.\n\n### 5. **External/Cloud Firewalls**\n\nCloud provider firewalls operate at the network level and cannot be bypassed by Docker's internal networking.\n\nThe DOCKER-USER chain approach is the most comprehensive solution, maintaining both container functionality and proper firewall control.\n\nSources:\n- [GitHub - chaifeng/ufw-docker: To fix the Docker and UFW security flaw without disabling iptables](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker)\n- [Packet filtering and firewalls | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/)\n- [Docker and UFW: The Silent Security Hole and How to Fix It | NIMIDAM](https://nimidam.com/docker-and-ufw-the-silent-security-hole-and-how-to-fix-it/)\n- [Why Docker Bypassed My UFW Firewall & How You Can Fix It](https://rithwik.hashnode.dev/how-docker-can-be-sneaky-around-your-ufw-firewall)\n- [Docker Container Published Port Ignoring UFW Rules | Baeldung on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/docker-container-published-port-ignoring-ufw-rules)\n- [Docker, UFW, and the Hidden Firewall Bypass: A Deep Technical Breakdown | Srikanth K](https://blogs.srikanthkarthi.tech/blog/docker-ufw-firewall-bypass)\n- [How to use UFW firewall with Docker containers?](https://blog.jarrousse.org/2023/03/18/how-to-use-ufw-firewall-with-docker-containers/)\n- [Docker + ufw: When convenience turns into a security risk | Lukas Rotermund](https://lukasrotermund.de/posts/docker-and-ufw_when-convenience-turns-into-a-security-risk/)\n- [How to Fix Docker Bypassing Firewall: A Complete Guide](https://www.bitdoze.com/docker-bypasses-firewall/)\n- [How to fix the Docker and UFW security flaw - TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-fix-the-docker-and-ufw-security-flaw/)","timestamp":40614}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"Docker_Networking","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-headless","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769114906767,"end":1769114947380,"firstResponse":40613,"sessionCreation":0,"total":40613},"toolErrors":false}

With modern phones (6.5+ inches), one-handed use is challenging, so designers prioritize placing frequent actions in the lower half of the screen.

{"id":"websearch-287","input":"<web-search>Find current information about: Tailscale VPN Windows Netzwerkgeschwindigkeit verlangsamt beheben 2025</web-search>","output":"Based on the search results, here's a summary of how to fix slow Tailscale VPN network speeds on Windows in 2025:\n\n## Common Causes of Slow Speeds\n\n**DERP Relay Usage**: If you see \"(relay)\" in your connection status, you're using a DERP relay server instead of a direct peer-to-peer connection, which significantly slows down performance. This often happens when firewall rules block certain ports or protocols.\n\n**VPN Conflicts**: Other VPN software can interfere with Tailscale, as many VPN programs try to prevent other software from making network configuration changes.\n\n## Solutions to Try\n\n**1. Check Connection Status**\nRun `tailscale status` in the command line to verify all devices show as \"active\" or \"connected\" and check for relay indicators.\n\n**2. Restart Tailscale Service**\nRestart the Tailscale service through the Windows taskbar icon or Services management console.\n\n**3. Update Client**\nEnsure you're running the latest Tailscale version on all devices, as outdated versions can cause compatibility and performance issues.\n\n**4. Re-authenticate**\nRun `tailscale logout` followed by `tailscale up` to refresh authentication tokens.\n\n**5. Check for VPN Conflicts**\nTemporarily disable other VPN software to see if it's causing conflicts with Tailscale.\n\n**6. Review Firewall Settings**\nEnsure your firewall isn't blocking Tailscale's direct peer-to-peer connections, forcing it to use slower relay servers.\n\n## Key Performance Factor\n\nTailscale is designed for direct peer-to-peer communication without a central server, which minimizes latency. When forced to use relay servers, performance degrades significantly.\n\nSources:\n- [Verbindung mit Hindernissen: Ihr `Tailscale VPN funktioniert nur teilweise`?

Check Connection Status**\nRun `tailscale status` in the command line to verify all devices show as \"active\" or \"connected\" and check for relay indicators.\n\n**2. Restart Tailscale Service**\nRestart the Tailscale service through the Windows taskbar icon or Services management console.\n\n**3. Update Client**\nEnsure you're running the latest Tailscale version on all devices, as outdated versions can cause compatibility and performance issues.\n\n**4. Re-authenticate**\nRun `tailscale logout` followed by `tailscale up` to refresh authentication tokens.\n\n**5. Check for VPN Conflicts**\nTemporarily disable other VPN software to see if it's causing conflicts with Tailscale.\n\n**6. Review Firewall Settings**\nEnsure your firewall isn't blocking Tailscale's direct peer-to-peer connections, forcing it to use slower relay servers.\n\n## Key Performance Factor\n\nTailscale is designed for direct peer-to-peer communication without a central server, which minimizes latency. When forced to use relay servers, performance degrades significantly.\n\nSources:\n- [Verbindung mit Hindernissen: Ihr `Tailscale VPN funktioniert nur teilweise`?

This is NOT a replacement for server-side authentication or access control.\n\nSources:\n- [Protected routes - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/protected/)\n- [Authentication in Expo Router - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/authentication/)\n- [Simplifying auth flows in Expo Router with protected routes](https://expo.dev/blog/simplifying-auth-flows-with-protected-routes)\n- [Simplifying Auth and Role-Based Routing with Stack.Protected in Expo Router - DEV Community](https://dev.to/aaronksaunders/simplifying-auth-and-role-based-routing-with-stackprotected-in-expo-router-592m)","timestamp":28685}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Expo_Router","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-headless","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769116503440,"end":1769116532125,"firstResponse":28685,"sessionCreation":0,"total":28685},"toolErrors":false}

Processes that work in production may not be optimal for tests where data needs to be imported quickly and in bulk.\n\n- **Batch Processing**: Using batch approaches like BulkIngester allows concurrent indexing requests with multiple documents per request, significantly reducing the number of requests and testing time.\n\n- **Smaller Test Batches**: Testing smaller batches of code makes it easier to identify problematic components, saving time and effort while improving isolation for debugging.\n\n## Testing Best Practices 2026\n\n- **Shift-Left Continuous Testing**: Performance validation now begins early in the CI/CD cycle, ensuring bottlenecks are caught before production deployment.\n\n- **Strategic Test Combination**: Combining unit and integration tests strategically rather than running all tests always.\n\n- **Framework Optimization**: Modern frameworks like FastEndpoints speed up test execution by preventing unnecessary application instantiations.\n\nThe consensus is that optimizing test performance requires a multi-faceted approach: efficient data handling, batch processing, early integration in CI/CD, and smart test selection strategies.\n\nSources:\n- [Run unittests as a pre-push hook to avoid merging code that fails tests](https://gist.github.com/stantonk/09227e9f32984858cebf589f0387004d)\n- [Elasticsearch integration tests: Making faster integration tests](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elasticsearch-integration-tests-faster)\n- [Should we transition from precommit hooks to prepush hooks?](https://github.com/phetsims/chipper/issues/1269)\n- [A pre-commit git hook for running Go unit tests](https://ornlu-is.github.io/git_hooks_for_go/)\n- [7 Integration Testing Best Practices in 2026](https://research.aimultiple.com/integration-testing-best-practices/)\n- [Integration & Unit Testing | FastEndpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com/docs/integration-unit-testing)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about fast unit tests, integration tests, pre-push hooks, and performance optimization.","timestamp":30468},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":30469},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01XHQ6LBwCsQh5AXFSyLbaxm","status":"completed","timestamp":30469},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the latest information from 2026, here are the key findings about optimizing unit tests, integration tests, and pre-push hooks:\n\n## Pre-Push Hooks\n\nPre-push hooks are effective for running unit tests before code is pushed to prevent merging code that fails tests.

This ensures all price volatility is captured, not just intraday movement.\n\n**ATR Calculation:**\nThe ATR is an N-period smoothed moving average of the True Range values. Wilder originally recommended a 14-period smoothing. The first ATR is simply the average of the first 14 daily TR values.\n\n## VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)\n\n**VWAP Formula:**\nVWAP = Sum of (Typical Price × Volume) / Sum of Volume\n\n**Typical Price:**\nTypical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n1.

This ensures all price volatility is captured, not just intraday movement.\n\n**ATR Calculation:**\nThe ATR is an N-period smoothed moving average of the True Range values. Wilder originally recommended a 14-period smoothing. The first ATR is simply the average of the first 14 daily TR values.\n\n## VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)\n\n**VWAP Formula:**\nVWAP = Sum of (Typical Price × Volume) / Sum of Volume\n\n**Typical Price:**\nTypical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n1. Calculate the typical price for each period: (H + L + C) / 3\n2. Multiply typical price by the period's volume\n3. Create a running total of these price-volume values\n4.

{"id":"websearch-375","input":"<web-search>Find current information about: Sloth SLO management best practices Kubernetes Prometheus 2025</web-search>","output":"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of **Sloth SLO management best practices** for Kubernetes and Prometheus:\n\n## What is Sloth?\n\nSloth is a tool that generates understandable, uniform, and reliable Prometheus SLOs for any kind of service. It's available as both a **CLI** and a **Kubernetes operator**, and is based on Google's SLO implementation and the multi-window multi-burn alerts framework.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Installation in Kubernetes**\nInstall Sloth using Helm for easy deployment:\n```bash\nhelm repo add sloth https://slok.github.io/sloth\nhelm repo update\nhelm install sloth sloth/sloth --namespace monitoring\n```\n\n### 2. **Define Clear SLIs**\nSloth supports two types of SLI definitions:\n- **Events-based**: Uses two queries - one for total/valid events and one for bad events.

It's available as both a **CLI** and a **Kubernetes operator**, and is based on Google's SLO implementation and the multi-window multi-burn alerts framework.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Installation in Kubernetes**\nInstall Sloth using Helm for easy deployment:\n```bash\nhelm repo add sloth https://slok.github.io/sloth\nhelm repo update\nhelm install sloth sloth/sloth --namespace monitoring\n```\n\n### 2. **Define Clear SLIs**\nSloth supports two types of SLI definitions:\n- **Events-based**: Uses two queries - one for total/valid events and one for bad events. Sloth divides them to calculate the error ratio (0-1).\n- **Raw**: A single Prometheus query that directly returns the error ratio (0-1).\n\n### 3. **Use Plugins for Standardization**\nSLI plugins help standardize queries across services and slightly modify them as needed.

The interface allows you to:\n\n- **Edit cards directly** and move them by clicking and dragging\n- **Reorganize the presentation structure** before finalizing the design\n- **Add or remove sections** from the outline view\n\n## Drag-and-Drop Interface Features\n\nGamma's drag-and-drop functionality includes:\n\n- **Smart templates and blocks** - Everything uses drag-and-drop, making it effortless to add new elements\n- **Card-level reorganization** - Click and drag entire cards to reorder them within the presentation\n- **Block-based editing** - Within each card, you can use \"blocks\" (text, images, charts) that can be edited, dragged, and rearranged\n- **WYSIWYG dashboard** - What-you-see-is-what-you-get editing environment\n- **Drag-and-drop uploads** - Supports easy file uploads through drag-and-drop\n\n## User Experience\n\nThe interface is designed to be intuitive, resembling tools like Notion for those familiar with modern document editors. The AI-powered design assistant helps users without design backgrounds create visually compelling presentations.

During this journey, he reportedly performed three miracles:\n- The first involved raising the water level of the Rokytka stream near present-day Říčany to help the procession cross\n- After his remains were placed in St. Vitus Rotunda, additional miracles occurred including freeing prisoners from dungeons and shackles, and healing those who prayed to him\n\n## Bazilika ve Staré Boleslavi\n\nThe Romanesque Basilica of St. Wenceslas with the crypt of Saints Cosmas and Damian stands on the site where, according to tradition, St. Wenceslas was murdered in 935 and buried for three years. It was founded by Prince Břetislav I after 1039 and consecrated in 1046. The basilica was recently reconstructed and reopened.\n\n## Svatá Ludmila - Zázraky\n\nMiracles were reported at her grave at Tetín after her death. According to Kristián's legend: \"From her tomb spread such an abundance of wonderful and sweet fragrance.\" Some sources suggest that Drahomíra built the Church of St. Michael to ensure miracles occurring at the site would be attributed to that saint rather than to Ludmila.\n\n## Svatí Kosma a Damián (Saints Cosmas and Damian)\n\nThese saints are credited with performing miracles. According to testimony from St. Gregory of Tours, those who came to their tomb asking for healing were immediately answered. A great number of miracles were attributed to them even after their death.\n\n## Rok 2026\n\nFor 2026 specifically, I found only one mention: the SVATÁ LUDMILA association will celebrate its 10th anniversary.

This makes it naturally suited for hierarchical data structures.\n\n**Index-Free Adjacency**: Neo4j's architecture ensures constant-time traversal between related nodes regardless of database size, making hierarchical queries highly efficient.\n\n## Hierarchical Relationship Patterns\n\n**Directional Design**: \n- All relationships should be directed from children to parents (going up the hierarchy)\n- Use a single relationship type for all hierarchical connections\n- Every child node should have exactly one outgoing relationship to its parent\n\n**Inheritance Modeling**:\n- Model categories, products, and attribute types as separate entities\n- Define attributes at the category level\n- Allow attribute inheritance to flow down to all descendants\n\n## Naming and Design Guidelines\n\n**Specific Relationship Types**: Choose descriptive, specific relationship names rather than generic ones. This enables Neo4j to traverse only relevant connections and improves query performance.\n\n**Relationship Type Rules**: Each relationship must have exactly one relationship type - specificity is key for optimal traversal.\n\n## Data Modeling Approach\n\n**Dual Modeling Strategy**:\n- Create both a data model (describes nodes, relationships, labels, types, and properties in the domain)\n- Create an instance model (shows actual data examples)\n\n**Schema Evolution**: Design for flexibility to allow applications to evolve, scale, and perform well over time.

This requires a flexible architecture that handles asynchronous events seamlessly.\n\n**Reactive Programming with Combine**: Combine's Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) approach is ideal for MVVM data binding. It allows view models to emit events reactively, and views automatically update when data changes - eliminating the need for manual UI update code in view models.\n\n## MVVM Best Practices\n\n**Unidirectional Data Flow**: Modern MVVM implementations avoid bidirectional relationships. Every UI update is triggered by an event, creating a single, predictable route through the app for all state changes.\n\n**Separation of Concerns**: The MVVM pattern combined with Combine provides clean separation between business logic and UI, resulting in single-purpose components that are easier to test, maintain, and evolve.\n\n**Observable View Models**: Use Combine publishers in view models to emit received events (especially asynchronous ones from WebSockets). Views subscribe to these publishers and reactively update the UI.\n\n## WebSocket Integration\n\nFor real-time chat, WebSocket connections should be managed at the model/service layer, with events propagated through Combine publishers to view models.

Their logo and brand assets are available in various formats (PNG, SVG, AI, EPS) through brand asset platforms. The company's website shows a 2026 copyright, indicating current operations, but there's no evidence of a new visual identity or rebranding initiative for 2026. They maintain their established brand identity as they navigate an increasingly complex global landscape.\n\n## Citadel\nCitadel LLC is an American multinational hedge fund founded in 1990 by Kenneth Griffin, with over $65 billion in assets under management as of January 2025. According to LCH Investments NV estimates, Citadel is considered the most profitable hedge fund manager of all time through December 31, 2024. Their official brand assets, logos, colors, and fonts are available through Brandfolder and Brandfetch with usage guidelines. No specific logo redesign or brand identity changes for 2026 were found.\n\n## Two Sigma\nTwo Sigma is an American hedge fund and financial sciences company headquartered in New York City that combines advanced technology and data science with rigorous inquiry to solve financial challenges. Their logo (available as an SVG on Wikimedia Commons since 2019) and brand assets are accessible through platforms like Brandfetch, particularly for Two Sigma Ventures.

Images can be passed as:\n- URLs pointing to image resources\n- Base64-encoded image data\n- File attachments through the attachments API\n\nThe SDK maintains unified APIs across different AI providers while supporting these multimodal features, making it straightforward to work with models that support vision capabilities (like GPT-4 Vision, Claude with vision, etc.).\n\nSources:\n- [AI SDK 6 - Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-sdk-6)\n- [Guides: Multi-Modal Chatbot - AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/guides/multi-modal-chatbot)\n- [Vercel AI SDK 3.3 - Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-ai-sdk-3-3)\n- [AI SDK by Vercel](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction)\n- [How to build unified AI interfaces using the Vercel AI SDK - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/unified-ai-interfaces-vercel-sdk/)","timestamp":26614}],"metadata":{"category":"API_Reference","subcategory":"Vercel AI SDK multimodal","lang":"JavaScript","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-headless","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769120842693,"end":1769120869307,"firstResponse":26614,"sessionCreation":0,"total":26614},"toolErrors":false}

{"id":"websearch-630","input":"<web-search>Find current information about: tailwindcss v4 \"outline-ring\" \"unknown utility\" error 2026</web-search>","output":"Based on the search results, there's a widespread issue with \"Cannot apply unknown utility class\" errors in Tailwind CSS v4.

The `outline-ring` utility may not exist in v4's standard distribution.\n\n3. **Import structure**: Ensure your main CSS file has `@import \"tailwindcss\";` and that other files properly reference it.\n\n### Regarding `outline-ring` Specifically:\n\nThis utility isn't commonly mentioned in Tailwind's standard v4 documentation. It might be:\n- A custom utility from your v3 config that needs to be migrated\n- Part of a plugin (like shadcn/ui components) that hasn't been updated for v4\n- Renamed to a different utility in v4\n\n**Recommendation**: Check if `outline-ring` is a custom utility or from a component library, and verify what the v4 equivalent should be.\n\nSources:\n- [Cannot apply unknown utility class · Discussion #13336](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/13336)\n- [Cannot apply unknown utility class: xxx · Issue #15778](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15778)\n- [Cannot apply unknown utility class: ... · Discussion #14491](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/14491)\n- [@tailwindcss/vite Cannot apply unknown utility class in @apply · Discussion #16278](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/16278)\n- [Cannot apply unknown utility class: group · Issue #16034](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16034)\n- [@apply Broken in Tailwind CSS v4.0 · Discussion #16429](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/16429)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about this Tailwind CSS v4 error.","timestamp":29263},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":29263},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_019VYADP7MoB4d3pWHcqQgYk","status":"completed","timestamp":29263},{"type":"message","content":"Based on the search results, there's a widespread issue with \"Cannot apply unknown utility class\" errors in Tailwind CSS v4.

Designed to \"use a database like a spreadsheet\" with rich collaboration capabilities.\n\n## **Key Differentiators**\n\n### **Advanced Capabilities**\n- **Baserow**: Includes native dashboards, application building, and automated workflows by default\n- **NocoDB**: Lacks native dashboard/workflow tools - focuses on basic database UI\n- **Teable**: Spreadsheet-centric with strong real-time collaboration\n\n### **Collaboration & Safety**\n- **Baserow**: Real-time collaboration, trash bin, undo-redo functionality, 50+ templates\n- **NocoDB**: Requires page refresh to see changes, no trash/undo features, no templates\n- **Teable**: Real-time collaboration optimized for spreadsheet-like workflows\n\n### **Deployment & Licensing**\nAll three support self-hosting. Baserow additionally offers hosted SaaS and doesn't limit essential functionality to enterprise tiers (unlike NocoDB). Teable's open-source edition supports basic online table collaboration.\n\n## **Best Use Cases**\n\n- **NocoDB**: Non-critical projects, smaller teams, developers needing quick Airtable UI over existing databases\n- **Baserow**: Small-to-medium businesses building custom CRM, ERP, or project management tools with advanced features\n- **Teable**: Small teams prioritizing spreadsheet UX with database power\n\n## **Bottom Line**\n\nFor 2026, **Baserow** appears most feature-complete for production use with its unified workspace, collaboration features, and data safety tools. **NocoDB** suits simpler projects leveraging existing databases. **Teable** excels for teams wanting a spreadsheet-first experience with database capabilities.\n\nSources:\n- [NocoDB vs Baserow: The Open-Source Showdown | by Baserow | Jan, 2026 | Medium](https://medium.com/@baserow/nocodb-vs-baserow-the-open-source-showdown-b61818d0ec93)\n- [NocoDB vs Baserow: The Open-Source Showdown](https://baserow.io/blog/nocodb-vs-baserow)\n- [6 Open-Source no-code Database Tools Like Airtable and Notion - NocoBase](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/6-open-source-no-code-database-tools)\n- [Is Airtable Too Expensive? 5 Self-Hosted Alternatives Compared by Cost & Features - NocoBase](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/5-self-hosted-airtable-alternatives)\n- [Baserow vs NocoDB: A Detailed Comparison for Low-Code/No-Code Platforms (2025)](https://openalternative.co/compare/baserow/vs/nocodb)","timestamp":42546}],"metadata":{"category":"Product_Info","subcategory":"Database_Tools","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false,"agent":"claude-headless","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769123073829,"end":1769123116375,"firstResponse":42546,"sessionCreation":0,"total":42546},"toolErrors":false}

{"id":"websearch-761","input":"<web-search>Find current information about: PostgREST functions as RPC default parameters and security definer best practices 2026</web-search>","output":"Based on my research, here are the current best practices for PostgREST functions with RPC, default parameters, and SECURITY DEFINER in 2026:\n\n## Key Best Practices\n\n### SECURITY DEFINER Usage\n\n**Use sparingly and cautiously:** SECURITY DEFINER functions should not be the main interface users interact with. Recent guidance (October 2025) emphasizes that SECURITY DEFINER can be manipulated and should be reserved for exceptional cases. For user-facing functions, SECURITY INVOKER is the safer default.\n\n**Permission model:** When using SECURITY DEFINER, only one permission check occurs - the permission to call the function. All operations within the function execute with the authority of the function owner, bypassing RLS policies.\n\n### Security Recommendations\n\n1. **Use `auth.uid()` instead of parameters:** Rather than accepting user IDs as function parameters, call `auth.uid()` directly within the function. This prevents users from accessing other users' data by manipulating parameters.\n\n2. **Private schema isolation:** Create sensitive functions in a private schema (e.g., `CREATE SCHEMA private`) instead of the public schema. PostgREST only exposes functions in the public schema via the `/rpc` endpoint, so this effectively hides security-critical functions from the API while keeping them available for triggers and RLS policies.\n\n3. **Defense in depth:** Combine multiple strategies - eliminate unnecessary parameters, use private schemas, and minimize SECURITY DEFINER usage.\n\n### Default Parameters\n\nThe current PostgREST documentation doesn't explicitly cover default parameters behavior. When calling functions via RPC:\n- POST requests use JSON objects where keys match parameter names\n- GET requests use query parameters\n- You'll need to test PostgreSQL default parameters with your specific PostgREST setup\n\n### Function Exposure\n\nAll functions in the exposed schema accessible by the active database role are executable under the `/rpc` prefix, so careful schema design and permission management are critical.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Functions as RPC — PostgREST 14 documentation](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api/functions.html)\n- [Possible to restrict rpc for policy security definer functions? · Discussion #3269](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/3269)\n- [Functions as RPC — PostgREST 12.2 documentation](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v12/references/api/functions.html)\n- [Supabase security strategy: RLS + RPC functions only](https://www.answeroverflow.com/m/1428006794835525794)","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for current information about PostgREST functions, RPC default parameters, and security definer best practices.","timestamp":50373},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":50373},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01Bf6YG9BTv7cXwCq3wCQuuh","status":"completed","timestamp":50373},{"type":"message","content":"Let me get more detailed information from the PostgREST documentation about default parameters specifically.","timestamp":50373},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":50373},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01RQ6sffx5Z2ARsQbcXtjp2Z","status":"completed","timestamp":50373},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":50373},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01KxbGgMRqZLGCsVJG8bFJwc","status":"completed","timestamp":50373},{"type":"message","content":"Based on my research, here are the current best practices for PostgREST functions with RPC, default parameters, and SECURITY DEFINER in 2026:\n\n## Key Best Practices\n\n### SECURITY DEFINER Usage\n\n**Use sparingly and cautiously:** SECURITY DEFINER functions should not be the main interface users interact with.
