{"id":"websearch-842","input":"Use ydc-server and answer\nWhat are the best prompt engineering techniques for bounding box detection in medical imaging using Vertex AI in 2026?","output":"Below is a 2026‑aligned, Vertex AI–specific answer that follows Google’s current multimodal prompt guidance and limitations. I’m using the latest Vertex AI docs (updated Jan 28, 2026). citeturn2contents0turn3contents0\n\n**Key reality check (important for medical imaging)**\n- Google’s multimodal Gemini models on Vertex AI are explicitly **not suitable for interpreting medical images** (e.g., X‑rays, CT) and have **limited spatial precision** for locating objects. This means prompt engineering alone is **not appropriate** for clinical‑grade medical bounding boxes. Use validated medical imaging models and human review for clinical use; prompts are best for non‑diagnostic, synthetic, or research‑only workflows. citeturn3contents0\n\n**Best prompt‑engineering techniques for bounding boxes (what works on Vertex AI today)**\nThese are derived from Vertex AI’s multimodal prompt best practices; I’ve adapted them to bounding boxes as an inference. citeturn2contents0turn3contents0\n- **Be explicit about outputs**: define the coordinate system (pixel vs. normalized), origin (top‑left), box format (xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax), and JSON schema. This follows the guidance to use specific instructions and specify the output format. citeturn2contents0\n- **Few‑shot with labeled examples**: include 1–3 example images and the exact box JSON you want. Few‑shot prompting is explicitly recommended and often stabilizes format and consistency. citeturn2contents0turn3contents0\n- **Split the task**: ask the model to first list target findings/structures, then output boxes. This aligns with “split complex tasks.” citeturn2contents0\n- **Focus the model on relevant regions**: explicitly say “ignore rulers, annotations, embedded text,” or “focus on lung fields only.” This follows “focus on relevant part of an image.” citeturn2contents0\n- **Use image quality best practices**: supply higher‑resolution, correctly oriented, non‑blurry images; place the image before the text; use a single image for precision when possible; index images if multiple slices are used. citeturn3contents0\n- **Tune decoding for determinism**: low temperature/top‑p for tight, repeatable structured outputs; increase only if outputs are too generic. citeturn3contents0\n- **Ask the model to reference the image**: have it “describe the image briefly before returning boxes” to reduce hallucinations; this aligns with “tailor the response to input.” citeturn2contents0\n\n**Practical prompt template (example)**\n(Example only; tailor to your dataset and ensure non‑diagnostic usage.)\n```text\nYou are annotating a non‑clinical, de‑identified medical image for research.\n\nTask:\n1) Identify all instances of [TARGET_STRUCTURE].\n2) Return bounding boxes in JSON with pixel coordinates.\nImage size: WIDTH=2048, HEIGHT=2048.\nCoordinate system: origin at top‑left.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is evolving rapidly with a formal roadmap, governance, and a public registry to standardize how agents and tools connect across ecosystems, signaling a shift from bespoke integrations to shared infrastructure. ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/development/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Protocols are adding coordination primitives, not just transport. The November 2025 MCP release introduced task-based workflows so clients can track multi-step work with explicit states (working, input_required, completed, etc.), which directly supports multi-agent orchestration and long-running coordination. ([blog.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Hierarchical team patterns are being productized. LangGraph Supervisor formalizes a supervisor–worker model (including supervisors-of-supervisors), which reflects a clear trend toward structured, multi-level team management rather than flat agent chats. ([changelog.langchain.com](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/langgraph-supervisor-a-library-for-hierarchical-multi-agent-systems?utm_source=openai))  \n- Orchestration is moving to workflow graphs and unified frameworks. Microsoft’s move to a unified “Agent Framework” (merging AutoGen and Semantic Kernel) emphasizes graph-based workflow APIs and multi-agent orchestration patterns as first-class primitives. ([github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions/7066?utm_source=openai))  \n- Coordination research is consolidating into systematic taxonomies. Surveys and reviews in 2024–2025 increasingly classify collaboration by structure (centralized vs distributed), roles, protocols, and strategies—showing the field’s push toward principled design rather than ad‑hoc agent teams. ([ijcai.org](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/890?utm_source=openai))  \n- Evaluation and operational rigor are now central. A 2025 survey of LLM-agent evaluation shows a shift to more realistic, continuously updated benchmarks and explicit measurement of safety, robustness, and cost—key for coordinating real-world agent teams. ([arxiv.gg](https://arxiv.gg/abs/2503.16416?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**What “hierarchical team management” looks like in practice now**\n- Supervisor-centric routing: one orchestrator handles user interaction, delegates to specialist workers, and aggregates results (explicitly supported in LangGraph Supervisor). ([changelog.langchain.com](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/langgraph-supervisor-a-library-for-hierarchical-multi-agent-systems?utm_source=openai))  \n- Graph-based workflows: team behavior is encoded as directed graphs with parallel branches, checkpoints, and stateful transitions (core in Microsoft’s Agent Framework direction). ([github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions/7066?utm_source=openai))  \n- Task lifecycle tracking: protocol-level task state and status queries (MCP tasks) are replacing ad‑hoc “are you done?” polling between agents.

Microsoft’s move to a unified “Agent Framework” (merging AutoGen and Semantic Kernel) emphasizes graph-based workflow APIs and multi-agent orchestration patterns as first-class primitives. ([github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions/7066?utm_source=openai))  \n- Coordination research is consolidating into systematic taxonomies. Surveys and reviews in 2024–2025 increasingly classify collaboration by structure (centralized vs distributed), roles, protocols, and strategies—showing the field’s push toward principled design rather than ad‑hoc agent teams. ([ijcai.org](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/890?utm_source=openai))  \n- Evaluation and operational rigor are now central. A 2025 survey of LLM-agent evaluation shows a shift to more realistic, continuously updated benchmarks and explicit measurement of safety, robustness, and cost—key for coordinating real-world agent teams. ([arxiv.gg](https://arxiv.gg/abs/2503.16416?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**What “hierarchical team management” looks like in practice now**\n- Supervisor-centric routing: one orchestrator handles user interaction, delegates to specialist workers, and aggregates results (explicitly supported in LangGraph Supervisor). ([changelog.langchain.com](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/langgraph-supervisor-a-library-for-hierarchical-multi-agent-systems?utm_source=openai))  \n- Graph-based workflows: team behavior is encoded as directed graphs with parallel branches, checkpoints, and stateful transitions (core in Microsoft’s Agent Framework direction). ([github.com](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions/7066?utm_source=openai))  \n- Task lifecycle tracking: protocol-level task state and status queries (MCP tasks) are replacing ad‑hoc “are you done?” polling between agents. ([blog.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIf you want, I can tailor this to your stack (LangGraph, AutoGen/Agent Framework, or custom MCP-based orchestration) or map these trends to concrete architecture choices.\n\nSuggestions:\n1) I can produce a 2025 reference architecture for a hierarchical agent team (supervisor + workers + tool servers).  \n2) I can compare LangGraph Supervisor vs Microsoft Agent Framework patterns for your use case.  \n3) I can summarize MCP adoption status and what it implies for your integration roadmap.","timestamp":74469}],"metadata":{"category":"Research","subcategory":"AI_Agents","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"mcpServer":"ydc-server","expectedTools":["you-search","you-express","you-contents"],"agent":"codex","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1769684627687,"end":1769684702156,"firstResponse":74469,"sessionCreation":0,"total":74469},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.9,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 60/70 (basic=10, tools=15, clean=25, sources=10).

([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/gq/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/?utm_source=openai))\n\nScope for iOS and macOS: Apple explicitly says the redesign extends across iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, aiming for a more unified experience across platforms while preserving each platform’s distinct characteristics. ([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/gq/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/?utm_source=openai))\n\nDeveloper angle: Apple provides updated APIs in native frameworks (SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit) to adopt the new design, and introduced tools like Icon Composer for crafting icons that fit the Liquid Glass aesthetic. ([apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-supercharges-its-tools-and-technologies-for-developers/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2025 vs 2026 context: The design system itself was announced June 9, 2025, and applies to the 2025/2026 major OS releases (version 26). As of today (Jan 29, 2026), there’s no separate, newer Apple design system publicly announced beyond Liquid Glass; it remains the current system for iOS and macOS.

This is a core orchestration best practice and directly reduces retry/backfill risk. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))\n- **Treat tasks like transactions; avoid partial outputs.** If a task fails mid‑way, it should not leave partial results in your lake/warehouse. Use atomic writes or staging/commit patterns. ([airflow.apache.org](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.6.0/best-practices.html?utm_source=openai))\n- **Don’t pass data via local disk between tasks; use shared storage and explicit metadata.** In distributed execution, tasks may run on different nodes.
