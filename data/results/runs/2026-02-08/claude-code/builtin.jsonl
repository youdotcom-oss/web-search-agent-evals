{"id":"websearch-2","input":"What are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026?","output":"Based on current research, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for 2026:\n\n## Landing Page Strategies\n\n**Mobile-First Optimization**: 83% of landing page visits happen on mobile devices, making mobile optimization critical for conversions.\n\n**Page Speed Performance**: 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load. Compress images, minimize scripts, and use modern formats to keep load times under 2.5 seconds (LCP).\n\n**Message Match**: Your landing page should mirror the promise in the ad that brought visitors there, maintaining consistent headlines, offers, and tone to reduce bounce rates.\n\n**AI-Powered Personalization**: Use AI-driven personalization and create multiple landing page variations for different audience segments, as each segment responds to different triggers.\n\n**Video Content**: Short explainer videos (30 seconds to 2 minutes) can lift conversions by up to 86%. Include captions and pair with clear CTAs.\n\n**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**: Structure headings, FAQs, and clear answers to rank in AI-powered search engines and featured snippets.\n\n**Continuous A/B Testing**: Small tweaks can produce significant results. Even a 10% conversion bump dramatically impacts revenue.\n\n## Gallery Design Patterns\n\n**Container Queries**: Now mainstream in 2026, container queries allow gallery items to adapt based on their container size rather than viewport dimensions, enabling truly modular components.\n\n**Bento Grids**: Flexible layouts that present content in varied container sizes, working well for showcasing features or content collections with varying importance.\n\n**CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern CSS Grid layouts with Flexbox formatting provide responsive galleries that naturally adapt without rigid breakpoints.\n\n**Content-Based Breakpoints**: Define breakpoints where content naturally requires adjustment, not arbitrary device sizes.\n\n**Image Optimization**: Specify width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts, implement lazy loading for faster page loads, and maintain CLS scores under 0.1.\n\n## Pricing Table Patterns\n\n**Card-Based Layouts**: Present each pricing plan in its own bordered card for clear side-by-side comparison.\n\n**Feature-First Design**: Emphasize core features over price, helping users quickly understand what each plan offers.\n\n**Interactive Toggles**: Monthly/yearly switches using checkboxes with smooth transitions.\n\n**Visual Hierarchy**: Use scale transforms and shadows to highlight recommended plans (\"Best Value\"), and use distinct colors to differentiate tiers.\n\n**Responsive Breakdown**: Tables collapse into stacked rows on mobile using Flexbox, maintaining readability on smaller screens.\n\n**Minimal Design**: Clean layouts with plenty of white space, clear labels, and only essential information reduce cognitive load and improve conversions by 20-30%.\n\nThe emphasis in 2026 is on **clarity, speed, and personalization** with mobile-first responsive patterns that adapt to content needs rather than device categories.\n\nSources:\n- [12 Landing Page Best Practices of 2026](https://www.leadfeeder.com/blog/landing-pages-convert/)\n- [20 Landing Page Optimization Practices for 2026](https://landerlab.io/blog/10-landing-page-optimization-practices-for-2024)\n- [15 high-converting landing page examples](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/high-converting-landing-pages/)\n- [20 Landing Page Examples That Actually Convert in 2026](https://www.superside.com/blog/landing-page-design-examples)\n- [Responsive Web Design in 2026: Trends and Best Practices](https://www.keelis.com/blog/responsive-web-design-in-2026:-trends-and-best-practices)\n- [Responsive Design Best Practices: The Complete 2026 Guide](https://pxlpeak.com/blog/web-design/responsive-design-best-practices)\n- [Tailwind CSS Best Practices 2025-2026](https://www.frontendtools.tech/blog/tailwind-css-best-practices-design-system-patterns)\n- [UI Design Trends 2026: 15 Patterns Shaping Modern Websites](https://landdding.com/blog/ui-design-trends-2026)\n- [How to Build a Pricing Table for Your Website in 2026](https://embeddable.co/blog/how-to-build-pricing-table-for-your-website)\n- [5 Inspiring Pricing Table Examples and Best Practices](https://crocoblock.com/blog/wordpress-pricing-table-best-practices/)","hint":"A correct answer must describe current (2026) high-converting landing page principles (clear value proposition and CTA, scannable layouts, social proof, mobile-first performance and responsiveness) and apply them specifically to galleries and pricing tables by mentioning modern responsive patterns (e.g., card- or grid-based galleries, carousels, masonry or modular layouts; stacked, accordion, or comparison-table pricing that reflows on small screens), along with UX details like visual hierarchy, clarity, and accessibility considerations for different devices.","trajectory":[{"type":"message","content":"I'll search for the latest information on landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for galleries and pricing tables in 2026.","timestamp":45293},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45293},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45293},{"type":"message","content":"","timestamp":45293},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01PFwWoga6FE84nQkxQChc4P","status":"completed","timestamp":45293},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01HVw6VhTuEwhf5Aj3yG8Cpx","status":"completed","timestamp":45293},{"type":"tool_call","name":"toolu_01UAiK5tw1EJW2DRhHCMd8b3","status":"completed","timestamp":45293},{"type":"message","content":"Based on current research, here are the best landing page strategies and responsive design patterns for 2026:\n\n## Landing Page Strategies\n\n**Mobile-First Optimization**: 83% of landing page visits happen on mobile devices, making mobile optimization critical for conversions.\n\n**Page Speed Performance**: 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load.

Download and install the IMS app from the [vvb2060 GitHub repository](https://github.com/vvb2060/Ims)\n2. Download and set up **Shizuku** on your device\n3.

The Ansible git module vulnerabilities would typically be tracked as part of the overall Ansible core CVEs\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Check the official Red Hat Ansible security advisories for the most up-to-date information\n- Consider upgrading from version 2.0.0, as it's significantly outdated and likely no longer receiving security updates\n- Review historical CVEs that may affect older versions like 2.0.0\n\nSources:\n- [Red Hat Ansible Security Vulnerabilities in 2026](https://stack.watch/product/redhat/ansible/)\n- [Ansible Automation Platform CVEs Addressed Report - Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7110982)\n- [Redhat Ansible security vulnerabilities, CVEs, versions and CVE reports](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/48886/Redhat-Ansible.html?vendor_id=25)\n- [Ansible Ansible versions and number of CVEs, vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/version-list/15207/38977/1/Ansible-Ansible.html)","timestamp":23378}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"Ansible","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770546048829,"end":1770546072207,"firstResponse":23378,"sessionCreation":0,"total":23378},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-557","input":"What are the best practices for handling an optional array parameter in a Supabase RPC for pricing overrides in 2026?","output":"Based on current best practices, here are the key recommendations for handling optional array parameters in Supabase RPC functions for pricing overrides:\n\n## **PostgreSQL Function Design**\n\n**1. Use DEFAULT NULL or DEFAULT ARRAY[]**\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION apply_pricing_overrides(\n    product_ids integer[],\n    override_prices numeric[] DEFAULT NULL\n)\nRETURNS TABLE(...) AS $$\nBEGIN\n    -- Your logic here\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n**2. Choose Between NULL vs Empty Array**\n- **NULL** = parameter not provided/no overrides\n- **Empty array `ARRAY[]::numeric[]`** = explicitly no overrides\n\nFor pricing overrides, NULL typically makes more sense semantically.\n\n**3. Handle NULL Within the Function**\n```sql\nIF override_prices IS NULL THEN\n    -- No overrides, use default pricing\n    RETURN QUERY SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ANY(product_ids);\nELSE\n    -- Apply overrides logic\n    RETURN QUERY \n        SELECT p.*, COALESCE(o.price, p.default_price) AS final_price\n        FROM products p\n        LEFT JOIN unnest(product_ids, override_prices) AS o(id, price) ON p.id = o.id;\nEND IF;\n```\n\n## **Client-Side Best Practices**\n\n**1.

{"id":"websearch-560","input":"How to use Vercel AI SDK streamText for multimodal content and image support in 2026","output":"Based on the latest information for 2026, here's how to use Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` for multimodal content and image support:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Vercel AI SDK supports multimodal capabilities in `streamText`, allowing you to work with both text and images. As of 2026, the SDK has evolved significantly with AI SDK 6, though the functional approach with `streamText` remains powerful and provides full control.\n\n## Sending Images to Models (Image Input)\n\nTo send images in messages, use the `messages` array with content parts:\n\n```typescript\nimport { streamText } from 'ai';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json();\n  \n  const result = streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4o'), // or other multimodal models\n    messages: [\n      {\n        role: 'user',\n        content: [\n          { type: 'text', text: 'What is in this image?' },\n          { \n            type: 'image', \n            image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' // URL or base64 data\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  });\n  \n  return result.toDataStreamResponse();\n}\n```\n\n## Receiving Generated Images (Image Output)\n\nModels like Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash can generate images directly. Access them through the stream:\n\n```typescript\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),\n  messages: [\n    { role: 'user', content: 'Generate an image of a sunset' }\n  ]\n});\n\n// Images arrive as events in the stream\n// On the client with useChat, images appear as file message parts\n```\n\n## Image Support in Tools\n\nFor returning images from tool calls during streaming:\n\n```typescript\nconst result = streamText({\n  model: openai('gpt-4o'),\n  messages,\n  tools: {\n    generateChart: {\n      description: 'Generate a chart image',\n      parameters: z.object({ data: z.array(z.number()) }),\n      execute: async ({ data }) => {\n        // Generate image and return\n        return {\n          content: [\n            { type: 'text', text: 'Here is your chart:' },\n            { \n              type: 'image', \n              data: imageBuffer, // or base64 string\n              mimeType: 'image/png'\n            }\n          ]\n        };\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Client-Side Usage (React)\n\nWith the `useChat` hook, handle multimodal content seamlessly:\n\n```typescript\nimport { useChat } from 'ai/react';\n\nexport default function Chat() {\n  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, append } = useChat();\n\n  // Send message with image\n  const handleImageUpload = async (file: File) => {\n    const base64 = await fileToBase64(file);\n    \n    append({\n      role: 'user',\n      content: [\n        { type: 'text', text: 'Analyze this image' },\n        { type: 'image', image: base64 }\n      ]\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {messages.map(m => (\n        <div key={m.id}>\n          {m.content.map((part, i) => (\n            part.type === 'text' ?

{"id":"websearch-614","input":"How to fix embedded YouTube videos not indexing on my blog posts in Google Search Console 2024","output":"I can help you troubleshoot YouTube video indexing issues in Google Search Console. Let me provide you with the most common solutions for 2024:\n\n## Common Fixes for YouTube Video Indexing Issues\n\n### 1. **Add Proper VideoObject Schema Markup**\nGoogle needs structured data to understand your embedded videos. Add this JSON-LD schema to your blog post:\n\n```json\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Video description\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"duration\": \"PT5M30S\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### 2. **Use the Correct Embed Method**\nEnsure you're using YouTube's iframe embed code:\n\n```html\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" \n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\" \n  title=\"Video title\"\n  frameborder=\"0\" \n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n```\n\n### 3. **Verify in Google Search Console**\n- Go to **Enhancements → Video** section\n- Check for specific errors like:\n  - Missing required fields\n  - Invalid URL format\n  - Thumbnail issues\n\n### 4. **Key Requirements Checklist**\n- ✅ Video must be publicly accessible (not behind login)\n- ✅ Video file must be visible on the page (not lazy-loaded incorrectly)\n- ✅ Include a high-quality thumbnail (min 160x90px, recommended 1280x720px)\n- ✅ Use HTTPS for all URLs\n- ✅ Add a sitemap with video entries\n- ✅ Ensure robots.txt doesn't block Googlebot-Video\n\n### 5. **Create a Video Sitemap**\nAdd this to your sitemap.xml:\n\n```xml\n<url>\n  <loc>https://yourblog.com/post-url</loc>\n  <video:video>\n    <video:thumbnail_loc>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg</video:thumbnail_loc>\n    <video:title>Video Title</video:title>\n    <video:description>Video description</video:description>\n    <video:content_loc>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID</video:content_loc>\n    <video:player_loc>https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID</video:player_loc>\n    <video:duration>330</video:duration>\n    <video:publication_date>2024-01-01T00:00:00Z</video:publication_date>\n  </video:video>\n</url>\n```\n\n### 6. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n- ❌ Using privacy-enhanced mode (`youtube-nocookie.com`) without proper setup\n- ❌ Lazy loading videos without proper schema markup\n- ❌ Missing or low-quality thumbnails\n- ❌ Not providing video title and description\n- ❌ Using relative URLs instead of absolute URLs\n\n### 7. **Test Your Implementation**\n1. Use Google's **Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results\n2. Paste your blog post URL to validate VideoObject schema\n3. Request indexing in Google Search Console after fixes\n\n### 8. **Timeline**\nAfter implementing these fixes:\n- Allow 1-2 weeks for Google to recrawl\n- Use \"Request Indexing\" in GSC to speed up the process\n- Monitor the Video enhancement report for improvements\n\nWould you like me to help you implement any of these solutions on your blog?

Add this JSON-LD schema to your blog post:\n\n```json\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Video Title\",\n  \"description\": \"Video description\",\n  \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg\",\n  \"uploadDate\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"duration\": \"PT5M30S\",\n  \"contentUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\",\n  \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\"\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### 2. **Use the Correct Embed Method**\nEnsure you're using YouTube's iframe embed code:\n\n```html\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" \n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\" \n  title=\"Video title\"\n  frameborder=\"0\" \n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n```\n\n### 3. **Verify in Google Search Console**\n- Go to **Enhancements → Video** section\n- Check for specific errors like:\n  - Missing required fields\n  - Invalid URL format\n  - Thumbnail issues\n\n### 4. **Key Requirements Checklist**\n- ✅ Video must be publicly accessible (not behind login)\n- ✅ Video file must be visible on the page (not lazy-loaded incorrectly)\n- ✅ Include a high-quality thumbnail (min 160x90px, recommended 1280x720px)\n- ✅ Use HTTPS for all URLs\n- ✅ Add a sitemap with video entries\n- ✅ Ensure robots.txt doesn't block Googlebot-Video\n\n### 5. **Create a Video Sitemap**\nAdd this to your sitemap.xml:\n\n```xml\n<url>\n  <loc>https://yourblog.com/post-url</loc>\n  <video:video>\n    <video:thumbnail_loc>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg</video:thumbnail_loc>\n    <video:title>Video Title</video:title>\n    <video:description>Video description</video:description>\n    <video:content_loc>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID</video:content_loc>\n    <video:player_loc>https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID</video:player_loc>\n    <video:duration>330</video:duration>\n    <video:publication_date>2024-01-01T00:00:00Z</video:publication_date>\n  </video:video>\n</url>\n```\n\n### 6. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n- ❌ Using privacy-enhanced mode (`youtube-nocookie.com`) without proper setup\n- ❌ Lazy loading videos without proper schema markup\n- ❌ Missing or low-quality thumbnails\n- ❌ Not providing video title and description\n- ❌ Using relative URLs instead of absolute URLs\n\n### 7. **Test Your Implementation**\n1. Use Google's **Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results\n2. Paste your blog post URL to validate VideoObject schema\n3. Request indexing in Google Search Console after fixes\n\n### 8. **Timeline**\nAfter implementing these fixes:\n- Allow 1-2 weeks for Google to recrawl\n- Use \"Request Indexing\" in GSC to speed up the process\n- Monitor the Video enhancement report for improvements\n\nWould you like me to help you implement any of these solutions on your blog? If you share your blog's platform (WordPress, custom HTML, etc.) or specific error messages from Search Console, I can provide more targeted guidance.","timestamp":18596}],"metadata":{"category":"Debugging","subcategory":"SEO_Indexing","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":false,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"messages-only","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770546679798,"end":1770546698394,"firstResponse":18596,"sessionCreation":0,"total":18596},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.73,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 45/70 (basic=10, tools=0, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-738","input":"How to use KSP for i18n code generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026","output":"# How to Use KSP for i18n Code Generation in Kotlin Multiplatform in 2026\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide on using KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) for internationalization in Kotlin Multiplatform projects:\n\n## Overview\n\nKSP is Google's modern alternative to KAPT for compile-time code generation in Kotlin. For i18n in Kotlin Multiplatform, there are several KSP-based libraries available as of 2026:\n\n## Recommended Libraries\n\n### 1. **Lyricist** (Most Popular for Compose Multiplatform)\n- Supports: Android, Desktop, iOS, Web (JsCanvas)\n- Generates type-safe string accessors\n- Supports parameterized strings\n- Enables dynamic language switching\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts\ndependencies {\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor:${version}\")\n    commonMainImplementation(\"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist:${version}\")\n}\n\n// Configure source generation\nkotlin.sourceSets.commonMain {\n    kotlin.srcDir(\"build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin\")\n}\n\ntasks.withType<KotlinCompile<*>>().all {\n    if (name != \"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\") {\n        dependsOn(\"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **i18n4k** (Actively Maintained - v0.11.1 as of Oct 2025)\n- Supports: JVM, JS, Native\n- Loads Java Properties files\n- Generates constants per message key\n- Creates optimized message files for runtime loading\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    id(\"de.comahe.i18n4k\") version \"0.11.1\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    commonMainImplementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core:0.11.1\")\n}\n```\n\n## KSP Configuration for Multiplatform\n\nStarting from KSP 1.0.1, the configuration syntax is:\n\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    // For specific targets\n    add(\"kspAndroid\", \"your.ksp.processor:version\")\n    add(\"kspIosX64\", \"your.ksp.processor:version\")\n    \n    // For common metadata (recommended for multiplatform)\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"your.ksp.processor:version\")\n}\n```\n\n## Basic Implementation Pattern\n\n1. **Define your strings** (e.g., in properties files or annotations)\n2. **Configure KSP processor** in build.gradle.kts\n3. **KSP generates type-safe accessors** at compile time\n4. **Use generated code** in your application\n\nExample usage with generated code:\n```kotlin\n// KSP generates something like:\nobject Strings {\n    val welcomeMessage: String\n    fun greetingWithName(name: String): String\n}\n\n// Usage:\nText(Strings.welcomeMessage)\nText(Strings.greetingWithName(\"Alice\"))\n```\n\n## Best Practices for 2026\n\n- **Use `kspCommonMainMetadata`** for shared multiplatform code\n- **Control visibility** of generated code via KSP arguments\n- **Support dynamic language switching** without app restarts\n- **Persist language preferences** across sessions\n- **Modularize localization** into separate modules for better organization\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor custom implementations, you can create your own KSP processor that:\n1. Reads resource files (JSON, Properties, etc.)\n2. Processes annotations on interfaces/classes\n3. Generates Kotlin code using KotlinPoet\n4. Outputs to `build/generated/ksp/`\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [i18n4k | Internationalization for Kotlin](https://comahe-de.github.io/i18n4k/)\n- [Thomas Kioko - Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization/)\n- [GitHub - adrielcafe/lyricist](https://github.com/adrielcafe/lyricist)\n- [KSP with Kotlin Multiplatform | Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-multiplatform.html)\n- [Thomas Kioko - Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform: Part 2](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization_part2/)\n- [GitHub - google/ksp: Kotlin Symbol Processing API](https://github.com/google/ksp)\n- [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile I18n for Android and iOS Apps | Phrase](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-i18n-android-ios/)","hint":"A good answer should explain how to configure and run a KSP processor in a modern (K2-era) Kotlin Multiplatform project (e.g., using `ksp<target>`/`ksp<SourceSet>` and `kspCommonMainMetadata`) and show how that processor is used to generate type‑safe i18n resources or accessors from source files (such as message bundles) that work across platforms.

For i18n in Kotlin Multiplatform, there are several KSP-based libraries available as of 2026:\n\n## Recommended Libraries\n\n### 1. **Lyricist** (Most Popular for Compose Multiplatform)\n- Supports: Android, Desktop, iOS, Web (JsCanvas)\n- Generates type-safe string accessors\n- Supports parameterized strings\n- Enables dynamic language switching\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\n// build.gradle.kts\ndependencies {\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist-processor:${version}\")\n    commonMainImplementation(\"cafe.adriel.lyricist:lyricist:${version}\")\n}\n\n// Configure source generation\nkotlin.sourceSets.commonMain {\n    kotlin.srcDir(\"build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin\")\n}\n\ntasks.withType<KotlinCompile<*>>().all {\n    if (name != \"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\") {\n        dependsOn(\"kspCommonMainKotlinMetadata\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **i18n4k** (Actively Maintained - v0.11.1 as of Oct 2025)\n- Supports: JVM, JS, Native\n- Loads Java Properties files\n- Generates constants per message key\n- Creates optimized message files for runtime loading\n\n**Setup:**\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    id(\"de.comahe.i18n4k\") version \"0.11.1\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    commonMainImplementation(\"de.comahe.i18n4k:i18n4k-core:0.11.1\")\n}\n```\n\n## KSP Configuration for Multiplatform\n\nStarting from KSP 1.0.1, the configuration syntax is:\n\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    // For specific targets\n    add(\"kspAndroid\", \"your.ksp.processor:version\")\n    add(\"kspIosX64\", \"your.ksp.processor:version\")\n    \n    // For common metadata (recommended for multiplatform)\n    add(\"kspCommonMainMetadata\", \"your.ksp.processor:version\")\n}\n```\n\n## Basic Implementation Pattern\n\n1. **Define your strings** (e.g., in properties files or annotations)\n2. **Configure KSP processor** in build.gradle.kts\n3. **KSP generates type-safe accessors** at compile time\n4. **Use generated code** in your application\n\nExample usage with generated code:\n```kotlin\n// KSP generates something like:\nobject Strings {\n    val welcomeMessage: String\n    fun greetingWithName(name: String): String\n}\n\n// Usage:\nText(Strings.welcomeMessage)\nText(Strings.greetingWithName(\"Alice\"))\n```\n\n## Best Practices for 2026\n\n- **Use `kspCommonMainMetadata`** for shared multiplatform code\n- **Control visibility** of generated code via KSP arguments\n- **Support dynamic language switching** without app restarts\n- **Persist language preferences** across sessions\n- **Modularize localization** into separate modules for better organization\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor custom implementations, you can create your own KSP processor that:\n1. Reads resource files (JSON, Properties, etc.)\n2. Processes annotations on interfaces/classes\n3. Generates Kotlin code using KotlinPoet\n4. Outputs to `build/generated/ksp/`\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [i18n4k | Internationalization for Kotlin](https://comahe-de.github.io/i18n4k/)\n- [Thomas Kioko - Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization/)\n- [GitHub - adrielcafe/lyricist](https://github.com/adrielcafe/lyricist)\n- [KSP with Kotlin Multiplatform | Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-multiplatform.html)\n- [Thomas Kioko - Internationalization (I18n) in Kotlin Multiplatform: Part 2](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/localization_part2/)\n- [GitHub - google/ksp: Kotlin Symbol Processing API](https://github.com/google/ksp)\n- [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile I18n for Android and iOS Apps | Phrase](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-i18n-android-ios/)","timestamp":41817}],"metadata":{"category":"Learning","subcategory":"Kotlin","lang":"Kotlin","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770546994649,"end":1770547036466,"firstResponse":41817,"sessionCreation":0,"total":41817},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":0.98,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

Structured Prompt Design**\n- Provide clear context and define the output format (e.g., JSON structure)\n- Specify bounding box coordinates format: [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] normalized to 0-1000\n- Include explicit instructions about what objects to detect and their characteristics\n\n**2. Prompt Mode Selection**\nFoundation models support multiple prompt modes:\n- **Point prompts**: For simple object identification\n- **Bounding box prompts**: For region-based detection\n- **Mask prompts**: For more precise segmentation\n- Choose based on the granularity needed for your medical imaging task\n\n**3. Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Prompting**\n- **Zero-shot**: Use single instruction to trigger model capability without examples\n- **One-shot/Few-shot**: Include contextual examples to help the model understand the task\n- Particularly valuable in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce\n\n**4. Instance-Level Prompt Generation (IPG)**\nRecent frameworks like iDPA show that generating prompts focused on dense predictions improves performance significantly:\n- 5.44% improvement in full data settings\n- Up to 12.88% improvement in few-shot scenarios\n\n## Medical Imaging Specific Best Practices\n\n**5. Task-Specific Prompts**\n- Design prompts for pathology-oriented tasks (tissue classification, anomaly detection, tumor localization)\n- Leverage MedGemma (Gemma 3 variants trained on medical text and images) for better medical context understanding\n- Use MedSigLIP for encoding medical images and text into common embedding space\n\n**6. Visual Context Integration**\n- Utilize Gemini 2.0's Visual Q&A capabilities to pass medical images directly without text conversion\n- Provide anatomical context in prompts (e.g., \"detect nodules in lung CT scan\" vs generic \"detect objects\")\n\n**7. Training Data Alignment**\n- Ensure prompts reflect the quality of inference images (e.g., if analyzing low-resolution ultrasounds, mention this in prompts)\n- Include imaging modality specifics (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound) in your prompts\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n**8. Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficiency**\n- Fine-tune prompts with minimal model parameter changes\n- Optimize prompt structure and content to activate pre-trained model's implicit knowledge\n- Particularly effective for adapting foundation models to specific medical tasks\n\n**9. Multi-Modal Prompting**\n- Combine text prompts with visual references\n- Use example images as part of the prompt when possible\n- Leverage transformer-based architectures with vision and prompt encoders\n\n**10. Iterative Refinement**\n- Start with general prompts and progressively add medical domain specifics\n- Test with different prompt complexities to find optimal balance\n- Monitor for hallucinations and validate outputs against ground truth\n\n## Implementation Recommendations\n\n- Use Vertex AI's experimental bounding box detection feature for custom instructions without training custom models\n- Apply responsible AI practices including fairness, interpretability, and security best practices\n- Consider AutoML for quick prototyping, then move to custom training for production systems\n- Leverage transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques when working with limited labeled datasets\n\nSources:\n- [Bounding box detection | Vertex AI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/bounding-box-detection)\n- [Gemini 2.0 Spatial Understanding with Vertex AI](https://bukempas.medium.com/diving-into-gemini-2-0-spatial-understanding-object-detection-with-vertex-ai-6838b35bb0ba)\n- [Hands-on Gemini 2.5 for Computer Vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/get-hands-on-with-google-gemini-2-5-for-computer-vision-tasks)\n- [iDPA: Instance Decoupled Prompt Attention](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hcjXy7kLFd)\n- [Large models in medical imaging: Advances and prospects](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12273654/)\n- [Vision-language foundation models for medical imaging](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13534-025-00484-6)\n- [Prompt Engineering in Medical Image Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292475/)\n- [Artificial intelligence in medical imaging foundation models](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11925424/)\n- [Google Cloud Enhances Vertex AI Search for Healthcare](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-cloud-enhances-vertex-ai-search-for-healthcare-with-multimodal-ai-302388639.html)\n- [Vertex AI Vision overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vision-ai/docs/overview)","hint":"A good answer must describe concrete prompt-engineering patterns for Gemini/Vertex AI image models (e.g., specifying task context, strict JSON schema for bounding box outputs, coordinate normalization system, label set, and confidence thresholds) and explicitly tie them to medical imaging use cases (e.g., multi-class lesions, small objects, multi-scale/pathology-specific prompts).

`-webkit-background-clip: text` (kept for older browser support)\n- `-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent` (makes the text transparent to show the gradient)\n\n### 2. **Radial Gradient Syntax**\n```css\nradial-gradient(\n  circle at [position],\n  color1 stop1,\n  color2 stop2,\n  ...\n)\n```\n\n### 3. **CSS Custom Properties for Dynamic Effects**\nUse `--mouse-x` and `--mouse-y` variables for interactive hover effects\n\n### 4. **Performance Optimizations**\n- Use `will-change: background` for smoother animations (if needed)\n- Use `cubic-bezier` timing functions for natural motion\n- Leverage CSS containment if applying to many elements\n\n### 5. **Browser Support in 2026**\nAll modern browsers fully support `background-clip: text`, but keep the `-webkit-` prefix for

Create a Web App Manifest (manifest.json)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"App\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",  // CRITICAL: Must be \"standalone\" or \"fullscreen\"\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: The `display` member MUST be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` - without this, Web Push is NOT enabled on iOS.\n\n#### 2. Link the Manifest in Your HTML\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n#### 3. Register a Service Worker\n\n```javascript\n// Register service worker\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Request Push Permission (User Gesture Required)\n\n```javascript\n// This MUST be triggered by user interaction (button click, etc.)\nasync function requestNotificationPermission() {\n  if ('Notification' in window && 'serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n    const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n    \n    if (permission === 'granted') {\n      // Subscribe to push notifications\n      const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n      const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n        userVisibleOnly: true,\n        applicationServerKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY'\n      });\n      \n      // Send subscription to your server\n      await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach to a button click\ndocument.getElementById('subscribe-btn').addEventListener('click', requestNotificationPermission);\n```\n\n#### 5.

Create a Web App Manifest (manifest.json)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Your App Name\",\n  \"short_name\": \"App\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",  // CRITICAL: Must be \"standalone\" or \"fullscreen\"\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: The `display` member MUST be set to `\"standalone\"` or `\"fullscreen\"` - without this, Web Push is NOT enabled on iOS.\n\n#### 2. Link the Manifest in Your HTML\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n```\n\n#### 3. Register a Service Worker\n\n```javascript\n// Register service worker\nif ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')\n    .then(registration => {\n      console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);\n    })\n    .catch(error => {\n      console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Request Push Permission (User Gesture Required)\n\n```javascript\n// This MUST be triggered by user interaction (button click, etc.)\nasync function requestNotificationPermission() {\n  if ('Notification' in window && 'serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n    const permission = await Notification.requestPermission();\n    \n    if (permission === 'granted') {\n      // Subscribe to push notifications\n      const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;\n      const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({\n        userVisibleOnly: true,\n        applicationServerKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY'\n      });\n      \n      // Send subscription to your server\n      await sendSubscriptionToServer(subscription);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Attach to a button click\ndocument.getElementById('subscribe-btn').addEventListener('click', requestNotificationPermission);\n```\n\n#### 5. Service Worker (sw.js)\n\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('push', event => {\n  const options = {\n    body: event.data ? event.data.text() : 'No payload',\n    icon: '/icon-192x192.png',\n    badge: '/badge-72x72.png'\n  };\n  \n  event.waitUntil(\n    self.registration.showNotification('Notification Title', options)\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('notificationclick', event => {\n  event.notification.close();\n  event.waitUntil(\n    clients.openWindow('/')\n  );\n});\n```\n\n### **User Installation Process**\n\nUsers must manually add your app to their home screen:\n\n1.

Look for stack traces with correlation ID\n2. **Verify recent deployments** - Did a recent change cause this?\n3. **Check dependencies** - Database, Redis, external APIs healthy?\n4. **Review metrics** - CPU, memory, request rate spikes?\n5. **Inspect specific customer data** - Is it data-specific?\n6. **Test endpoint directly** - Can you reproduce locally?\n7. **Check middleware chain** - Which middleware is failing?\n8. **Review error rates** - Is it affecting all requests or specific patterns?\n\n### 7. **AI-Assisted Debugging (2026)**\n- Use AI-powered log analysis (Datadog Bits, AWS Q Developer)\n- LLM-based error explanation and suggested fixes\n- Automated root cause analysis from traces\n- Predictive alerts before full failures\n\n### 8. **Prevention Best Practices**\n```javascript\n// Always wrap async route handlers\napp.get('/api/customers/:id', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {\n  const customer = await db.customer.findUnique({\n    where: { id: req.params.id }\n  });\n  \n  if (!customer) {\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Customer not found' });\n  }\n  \n  res.json(customer);\n}));\n\n// Implement circuit breakers for external calls\nconst breaker = new CircuitBreaker(externalAPI.call, {\n  timeout: 3000,\n  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,\n  resetTimeout: 30000\n});\n```\n\n## Quick Debug Commands\n\n```bash\n# Check application logs\nkubectl logs -f pod-name --tail=100\n\n# Search for specific customer errors\ngrep \"customerId:12345\" app.log | grep ERROR\n\n# Check database connections\npg_stat_activity query (PostgreSQL)\n\n# Monitor in real-time\nhtop / top for resource usage\n\n# Test endpoint with verbose output\ncurl -v -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n  https://api.example.com/customers/123\n```\n\nThe key in 2026 is having **proactive observability** in place before issues occur, rather than reactive debugging.

Downloading Generated Files\n\nWhen skills create files, you need to extract the `file_id` and use the Files API:\n\n```python\n# Extract file ID from response\nfile_id = None\nfor block in response.content:\n    if block.type == 'tool_use' and block.name == 'code_execution':\n        for result_block in block.content:\n            if hasattr(result_block, 'file_id'):\n

Now I have comprehensive information about the Claude Code Skills API for 2026. Let me provide you with a complete guide.\n\n# Using the Claude Code Skills API in 2026\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide to using Anthropic's Skills API from the anthropics/skills GitHub repository:\n\n## Overview\n\n**Agent Skills** extend Claude's capabilities through organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources. They integrate with the Messages API through code execution and support both pre-built (Anthropic-managed) and custom skills.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\n- **Anthropic API key** from the [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)\n- **Beta headers** required:\n  - `code-execution-2025-08-25` - Enables code execution\n  - `skills-2025-10-02` - Enables Skills API\n  - `files-api-2025-04-14` - For uploading/downloading files\n- **Code execution tool** enabled in requests\n\n### 2. List Available Skills\n\n```python\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Anthropic()\n\n# List all Anthropic-managed Skills\nskills = client.beta.skills.list(\n    source=\"anthropic\",\n    betas=[\"skills-2025-10-02\"]\n)\n\nfor skill in skills.data:\n    print(f\"{skill.id}: {skill.display_title}\")\n```\n\nPre-built skills include: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pdf`.\n\n### 3. Use a Skill\n\n```python\nresponse = client.beta.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-opus-4-6\",\n    max_tokens=4096,\n    betas=[\"code-execution-2025-08-25\", \"skills-2025-10-02\"],\n    container={\n        \"skills\": [\n            {\"type\": \"anthropic\", \"skill_id\": \"pptx\", \"version\": \"latest\"}\n        ]\n    },\n    messages=[{\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides\"\n    }],\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"code_execution_20250825\", \"name\": \"code_execution\"}]\n)\n```\n\n## Creating Custom Skills\n\n### Skill Structure\n\nSkills are simple folders with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: my-skill-name\ndescription: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it\n---\n\n# My Skill Name\n\n[Instructions that Claude will follow when this skill is active]\n\n## Examples\n- Example usage 1\n- Example usage 2\n\n## Guidelines\n- Guideline 1\n- Guideline 2\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- `name`: Max 64 chars, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only\n- `description`: Max 1024 chars\n- Total upload size: Under 8MB\n- Must include SKILL.md at top level\n\n### Upload a Custom Skill\n\n```python\nfrom anthropic.lib import files_from_dir\n\n# Option 1: Using directory path (Python only, recommended)\nskill = client.beta.skills.create(\n    display_title=\"Financial Analysis\",\n    files=files_from_dir(\"/path/to/financial_analysis_skill\"),\n    betas=[\"skills-2025-10-02\"]\n)\n\n# Option 2: Using a zip file\nskill = client.beta.skills.create(\n    display_title=\"Financial Analysis\",\n    files=[(\"skill.zip\", open(\"financial_analysis_skill.zip\", \"rb\"))],\n    betas=[\"skills-2025-10-02\"]\n)\n\nprint(f\"Created skill: {skill.id}\")\nprint(f\"Latest version: {skill.latest_version}\")\n```\n\n### Use Your Custom Skill\n\n```python\nresponse = client.beta.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-opus-4-6\",\n    max_tokens=4096,\n    betas=[\"code-execution-2025-08-25\", \"skills-2025-10-02\"],\n    container={\n        \"skills\": [\n

messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Analyze this data\"}],\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"code_execution_20250825\", \"name\": \"code_execution\"}]\n)\n```\n\n## Managing Skills\n\n### List Skills\n\n```python\n# List all skills (both Anthropic and custom)\nall_skills = client.beta.skills.list(betas=[\"skills-2025-10-02\"])\n\n# List only custom skills\ncustom_skills = client.beta.skills.list(\n    source=\"custom\",\n    betas=[\"skills-2025-10-02\"]\n)\n```\n\n### Retrieve a Skill\n\n```python\nskill = client.beta.skills.retrieve(\n    skill_id=\"skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv\",\n    betas=[\"skills-2025-10-02\"]\n)\n```\n\n### Create New Version\n\n```python\nnew_version = client.beta.skills.versions.create(\n

skill\nclient.beta.skills.delete(\n    skill_id=\"skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv\",\n    betas=[\"skills-2025-10-02\"]\n)\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Using Multiple Skills\n\nYou can combine up to 8 skills per request:\n\n```python\nresponse = client.beta.messages.create(\n    model=\"claude-opus-4-6\",\n    max_tokens=4096,\n    betas=[\"code-execution-2025-08-25\",

messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Analyze sales data and create a presentation\"}],\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"code_execution_20250825\", \"name\": \"code_execution\"}]\n)\n```\n\n### Downloading Generated Files\n\nWhen skills create files, you need to extract the `file_id` and use the Files API:\n\n```python\n# Extract file ID from response\nfile_id = None\nfor block in response.content:\n    if block.type == 'tool_use' and block.name == 'code_execution':\n        for result_block in block.content:\n            if hasattr(result_block, 'file_id'):\n                file_id = result_block.file_id\n                break\n\nif file_id:\n    # Download the file\n    file_content = client.beta.files.download(\n        file_id=file_id,\n

Use `expo-secure-store` instead\n- **Unencrypted**: Data is stored in plain text\n- **Size limitations**: Best for small amounts of data\n- **Alternative**: For larger data needs, consider `expo-storage` which uses the file system\n\n## Additional Methods\n\n- `getAllKeys()` - Get all stored keys\n- `multiGet([keys])` - Get multiple values\n- `multiSet([[key, value], ...])` - Set multiple values\n- `clear()` - Remove all data\n\n**Sources:**\n- [AsyncStorage - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/async-storage/)\n- [Store data - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/store-data/)\n- [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage)\n- [How to Store Data Locally in React Native Expo](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-store-data-locally-in-react-native-expo/)","timestamp":26900}],"metadata":{"category":"Documentation","subcategory":"Expo","lang":"React","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770550442479,"end":1770550469379,"firstResponse":26900,"sessionCreation":0,"total":26900},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).

{"id":"websearch-1710","input":"how to fix raw mode is not supported error in Ink CLI 2026","output":"Based on my research, here are the solutions to fix the \"raw mode is not supported\" error in Ink CLI applications:\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. **Use `isRawModeSupported` Check (Recommended)**\n\nThe best approach is to check if raw mode is supported before using interactive components:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useStdin } from 'ink';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const { isRawModeSupported, setRawMode } = useStdin();\n  \n  if (!isRawModeSupported) {\n    // Fall back to non-interactive mode\n    return <Text>Non-interactive mode - use environment variables</Text>;\n  }\n  \n  return <MyInteractiveComponent />;\n};\n```\n\n### 2. **Check TTY Before Rendering Ink**\n\nBefore rendering your Ink app, check if stdin is a TTY:\n\n```javascript\nconst isRawModeSupported = process.stdin.isTTY && typeof process.stdin.setRawMode === 'function';\n\nif (!isRawModeSupported) {\n  console.error('Interactive mode not supported.

Here's a comprehensive strategy for 2026:\n\n## Detection Techniques\n\n### 1. **IP Intelligence & Reputation**\n- **Proxy/VPN Detection APIs**: Use services like IPQualityScore, MaxMind, or IPHub to identify datacenter IPs, residential proxies, and VPN endpoints\n- **IP Velocity Tracking**: Monitor how quickly the same account/session switches between IP addresses\n- **Geolocation Anomalies**: Flag impossible travel (e.g., login from Singapore, then New York 5 minutes later)\n- **ASN Analysis**: Track Autonomous System Numbers to identify hosting providers commonly used for proxies\n\n### 2. **Device Fingerprinting**\n- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Canvas fingerprinting, WebGL, AudioContext, font enumeration, hardware specs\n- **TLS/JA3 Fingerprinting**: Analyze TLS handshake patterns to identify automated tools\n- **HTTP/2 Fingerprinting**: Detect inconsistencies in HTTP headers and connection patterns\n- **Behavioral Biometrics**: Mouse movements, typing patterns, scroll behavior (hard to replicate across proxies)\n\n### 3. **Session & Behavioral Analysis**\n- **Session Consistency**: Track if device fingerprint changes while IP rotates\n- **Action Velocity**: Rapid actions (add to cart, checkout) across different IPs\n- **Purchase Pattern Analysis**: Unusual buying patterns (bulk purchases, high-value items, same shipping address)\n- **Time-based Anomalies**: Activity patterns that don't match human behavior (24/7 activity, millisecond-precise timing)\n\n### 4. **Advanced Detection Methods**\n```python\n# Example: Multi-factor risk scoring\ndef calculate_proxy_risk_score(request_data):\n    risk_score = 0\n    \n    # IP reputation check\n    if is_datacenter_ip(request_data['ip']):\n        risk_score += 30\n    if is_known_proxy(request_data['ip']):\n        risk_score += 40\n    \n    # Velocity checks\n    if get_ip_changes_last_hour(request_data['user_id']) > 5:\n        risk_score += 25\n    \n    # Fingerprint consistency\n    if fingerprint_changed(request_data['user_id'], request_data['fingerprint']):\n        risk_score += 20\n    \n    # Behavioral signals\n    if request_data['time_on_page'] < 2:  # seconds\n        risk_score += 15\n    \n    return risk_score\n```\n\n## Prevention Strategies\n\n### 1. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**\n- **Adaptive Rate Limits**: Stricter limits for suspicious IPs/patterns\n- **CAPTCHA Challenges**: Progressive challenges (invisible → checkbox → image selection) based on risk score\n- **Proof-of-Work**: Computational challenges for high-risk requests\n\n### 2. **Authentication Hardening**\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: SMS, email, authenticator apps\n- **Device Binding**: Trust known devices, challenge new ones\n- **Step-up Authentication**: Require additional verification for sensitive actions (payment, address changes)\n\n### 3. **Network-Level Defenses**\n- **WAF Rules**: Web Application Firewall rules to block known proxy networks\n- **DDoS Protection**: Services like Cloudflare, Akamai with proxy detection\n- **Connection Fingerprinting**: Block requests with suspicious TLS/HTTP characteristics\n\n### 4. **Transaction-Level Controls**\n```python\n# Example: Transaction verification flow\ndef verify_high_risk_transaction(transaction):\n    risk_signals = []\n    \n    #

Here's what you need to know:\n\n## Overview\n\n**YiPay** is a Taiwan-based payment gateway that supports multiple local payment methods including credit cards, WebATM, convenience store payments, and virtual account transfers.\n\n**New-API** (and one-api) are AI Gateway platforms that provide unified interfaces for AI service providers. New-API specifically includes payment integration capabilities that support various payment channels.\n\n## Integration Approach\n\n### 1. **New-API Payment Settings**\n\nNew-API provides built-in payment configuration that can aggregate channels such as:\n- WeChat Pay\n- Alipay\n- Bank cards\n- Custom payment gateways\n\nThe system offers unified interfaces for:\n- Order creation (`out_trade_no`, `amount`, `subject`)\n- Signature verification\n- Payment callbacks (`notify_url`, `return_url`)\n\n### 2. **YiPay Integration Steps**\n\nTo integrate YiPay with new-api/one-api:\n\n1. **Obtain YiPay API Credentials**: Contact YiPay directly to access their technical documentation and API credentials (not publicly available online)\n\n2. **Configure Payment Gateway**: Add YiPay as a payment provider in new-api's payment settings with the required fields:\n   - API endpoint URL\n   - Merchant ID\n   - API keys/signatures\n   - Callback URLs\n\n3. **Implement Payment Flow**:\n   - Create orders through new-api's unified interface\n   - Route payments to YiPay backend\n   - Handle payment callbacks and notifications\n   - Verify webhook signatures for security\n\n### 3. **Key Considerations**\n\n- **Webhook Security**: Always verify YiPay webhook signatures before processing callbacks\n- **Testing**: Use YiPay's sandbox/test environment before going live\n- **Idempotency**: Implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges\n- **Error Handling**: Plan for payment failures, timeouts, and retry logic\n\n### 4. **Next Steps**\n\nSince YiPay's API documentation is not publicly available, you'll need to:\n1. Contact YiPay for developer documentation and API specifications\n2. Request test credentials and sandbox access\n3. Review their webhook events and callback formats\n4.

This is a common issue with Laravel packages that don't regularly update their dependencies.\n\n## Solutions (in order of recommendation):\n\n### **Solution 1: Use a Fork or Alternative Package (Recommended)**\n\nSince `shetabit/visitor` may not be actively maintained for Laravel 11/12, consider:\n\n```bash\n# Search for maintained forks\ncomposer search visitor laravel\n```\n\nOr use alternative visitor tracking packages:\n- `stevebauman/location` - IP-based location tracking\n- `torann/geoip` - Geolocation package\n- `jenssegers/agent` - User agent parsing\n\n### **Solution 2: Composer Ignore Platform Requirements (Quick Fix)**\n\n```bash\ncomposer require shetabit/visitor --ignore-platform-reqs\n```\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: This bypasses dependency checks and may cause runtime errors.\n\n### **Solution 3: Use Composer's Inline Alias**\n\nForce a compatible version constraint:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"dev-master as 5.0\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Solution 4: Create a Local Fork**\n\n1. **Fork the package locally:**\n\n```bash\n# Create a packages directory\nmkdir -p packages/shetabit\ncd packages/shetabit\n\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/shetabit/visitor.git\ncd visitor\n\n# Edit composer.json\n```\n\n2. **Update the `composer.json` in the forked package:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"require\": {\n        \"illuminate/support\": \"^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Add to your project's composer.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"repositories\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"path\",\n            \"url\": \"./packages/shetabit/visitor\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Solution 5: Patch with composer-patches**\n\n1. **Install composer-patches:**\n\n```bash\ncomposer require cweagans/composer-patches\n```\n\n2. **Add to your composer.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"patches\": {\n            \"shetabit/visitor\": {\n                \"Fix Laravel 10/11/12 compatibility\": \"patches/shetabit-visitor-laravel-compatibility.patch\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Create patch file** (`patches/shetabit-visitor-laravel-compatibility.patch`):\n\n```diff\n--- a/composer.json\n+++ b/composer.json\n@@ -15,7 +15,7 @@\n     ],\n     \"require\": {\n         \"php\": \"^7.2|^8.0\",\n-        \"illuminate/support\": \"^6.0|^7.0|^8.0|^9.0\",\n+        \"illuminate/support\": \"^6.0|^7.0|^8.0|^9.0|^10.0|^11.0|^12.0\",\n         \"jenssegers/agent\": \"^2.6\"\n     }\n }\n```\n\n### **Solution 6: Minimum Stability (Last Resort)**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"minimum-stability\": \"dev\",\n    \"prefer-stable\": true,\n    \"require\": {\n        \"shetabit/visitor\": \"dev-master\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## **Recommended Approach for 2026:**\n\nGiven that Laravel 12 is current in 2026, I recommend:\n\n1. **First**, check if there's an actively maintained fork or alternative\n2. **If not**, create a local fork (Solution 4) - this gives you full control\n3. **Test thoroughly** - the package may have other compatibility issues beyond composer constraints\n\n## **After Installation:**\n\n```bash\n# Clear caches\nphp artisan config:clear\nphp artisan cache:clear\nphp artisan view:clear\n\n# Publish vendor assets if needed\nphp artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Shetabit\\Visitor\\VisitorServiceProvider\"\n```\n\nWould you like me to help you implement any of these solutions in your Laravel project? Please share your `composer.json` file or let me know which Laravel version you're using, and I can provide more specific guidance.","hint":"A good answer should explain that `shetabit/visitor` depends on `illuminate/support` and that Laravel already provides `illuminate/support` via `laravel/framework`, so you must adjust or remove any direct `illuminate/support` constraint (or update the package/version constraint) to avoid version conflicts when targeting Laravel 10–12. It should mention using compatible Composer constraints for `shetabit/visitor` and Laravel (e.g., via Packagist or Laravel Shift) and resolving the “laravel/framework replaces illuminate/support and thus cannot coexist with it” style conflict.

Current working directory (`./AGENTS.md`)\n2. Nearest parent directory (up to repo root)\n3. Subfolders within the project\n4. Personal override at `~/.factory/AGENTS.md`\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Keep it concise**: ≤150 lines for optimal performance\n- **Be specific**: Use exact, copy-paste-ready commands\n- **Stay current**: Update during PR reviews\n- **Link, don't duplicate**: Reference existing docs\n- **Require verification**: Tests, linting, type checks\n\n## Common Sections\n\n| Section | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| Build & Test | Exact compilation and test suite commands |\n| Architecture Overview | Major modules and data flow |\n| Security | Authentication, API keys, rate limits |\n| Git Workflows | Branching strategy, commit conventions |\n| Conventions & Patterns | Folder structure, naming, code style |\n\n## How Agents Use It\n\n1. **Ingestion**: Load nearest AGENTS.md at task start\n2. **Planning**: Use commands to structure execution\n3. **Tool selection**: Apply conventions to guide operations\n4. **Validation**: Use domain vocabulary to reduce hallucinations\n\n## Cross-Platform Compatibility\n\nWorks across the entire AI development ecosystem: Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Aider, Gemini CLI, Jules, Zed, VS Code, and more.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [AGENTS.md - Factory Documentation](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/agents-md)\n- [AGENTS.md Official Site](https://agents.md/)\n- [Factory joins AGENTS.md collaboration with OpenAI](https://factory.ai/news/agents-md)\n- [GitHub - agentsmd/agents.md](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md)\n- [Custom instructions with AGENTS.md - OpenAI Developers](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md/)\n- [Agents.md: A Machine-Readable Alternative to README](https://research.aimultiple.com/agents-md/)\n- [AGENTS.md: A New Standard for Unified Coding Agent Instructions - Medium](https://addozhang.medium.com/agents-md-a-new-standard-for-unified-coding-agent-instructions-0635fc5cb759)","timestamp":58078}],"metadata":{"category":"Product_Info","subcategory":"Factory","lang":"None","tool":"WebSearch","is_dev":true,"agent":"claude-code","trajectoryRichness":"full","turnCount":1,"exitCode":0,"timedOut":false},"timing":{"start":1770551724290,"end":1770551782368,"firstResponse":58078,"sessionCreation":0,"total":58078},"toolErrors":false,"score":{"pass":true,"score":1,"reasoning":"Deterministic: 70/70 (basic=10, tools=25, clean=25, sources=10).
